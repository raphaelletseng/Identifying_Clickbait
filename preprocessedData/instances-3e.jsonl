DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award during the 74th annual Golden Globe Awards", "The wall placed around Donald Trump\u2019s Hollywood Walk Of Fame star."], "targetParagraphs": ["Calling the president-elect racist, sexist or a bully doesn\u2019t hit home. But Streep, in her withering Golden Globes speech, found a way to get under his skin", "Where innumerable others have failed over the past months, years, decades, Meryl Streep looks to have really struck a nerve with Donald Trump at the Golden Globe awards last night. Not by simply criticising the president-elect for the bullying, potentially violent culture he threatens to bring to American public life. Many have done that before, with equally accomplished thespian delivery, including Hugh Laurie earlier that evening (\u201cI accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere\u201d). Streep built on that sentiment in her acceptance speech for the Cecil B DeMille award, condemning Trump\u2019s mockery of a disabled reporter in a speech in 2015. But Streep\u2019s masterstroke was to characterise Trump\u2019s antics as performance.", "\u201cThere was one performance this year that stunned me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good; there was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job.\u201d She sounds like the most withering theatre critic ever. If that was a review and you had to work a quote out of it for a poster, the best you could do would be: \u201c\u2018Effective\u2019 \u2013 Meryl Streep.\u201d", "Streep, though, has identified one of Trump\u2019s key weaknesses. You can criticise him all you like for being a racist, a sexist, a sexual predator, a homophobe, a xenophobe, a conspiracy theorist, a bully, or a bad advert for male grooming, but it\u2019s all water off a duck\u2019s back \u2013 you could even say that duck is sitting on Trump\u2019s head pretending to be a toupee \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. But to disrespect Trump\u2019s performance \u2013 that\u2019s gotta hurt.", "Inevitably, Trump has been quick to respond, denying accusations he was mocking the disabled reporter \u2013 New York Times journalist Serge Kovaleski \u2013 and reminding the public that Streep, \u201cone of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood\u201d, introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention and that \u201ca lot of these people supported Hillary\u201d. He wasn\u2019t surprised, he said, he was being attacked by \u201cliberal movie people\u201d. And sure enough, his defenders scrambled to the social media fronts to boo and hiss liberal Hollywood.", "But the reality is, Trump desperately wants to be one of those movie people. Or at least be accepted by them. And when he\u2019s not, he doesn\u2019t like it. It was only a few short years ago that Trump was complaining about not getting his own awards: \u201cI should have many Emmys for The Apprentice if the process were fair,\u201d he tweeted in 2013, after his show was passed up for an award for the ninth time. It was only a few years earlier, in 2005, when Trump was gamely dressing up as a hillbilly and singing Green Acres at the Emmy awards show. Not even Streep would describe that performance as \u201ceffective\u201d. It certainly didn\u2019t win Trump any awards, and he has been consistently, disproportionately pissed off about it. (Sample tweets: \u201cThe Emmys are sooooo boring! Terrible show.\u201d \u201cLots of people agree that the Emmys were a joke \u2013 got bad ratings \u2013 no credibility!\u201d) When Hillary Clinton mocked him for caring about Emmy-rigging more then election-rigging during the presidential debates, Trump couldn\u2019t resist interjecting \u201cshoulda gotten it\u201d.", "For all his wall-building zeal, Trump has all but demolished what barriers remained between showbiz and politics. But unlike, say Ronald Reagan, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, you get the sense the former was his ultimate ambition more than the latter. He has regularly and willingly put himself in front of the camera for brand promotional purposes, and has never been shy of a movie cameo or a special guest appearance, from Home Alone 2 to Zoolander, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to Sex and the City. By all accounts, getting Trump for a cameo is not hard; keeping him from hamming it up in front of the camera can be, though. The makers of Home Alone 2 didn\u2019t even ask him to be in it, but since he owned the hotel they were filming in, they could hardly say no when he turned up on the set. The only acting award he has received to date was a Razzie for worst supporting actor for the 1991 movie Ghosts Can\u2019t Do It. Not many people can claim to have been acted off the screen by Bo Derek.", "Despite this resounding lack of acclaim, Trump clearly enjoys his celebrity status \u2013 and the power it brings. That was made clear by the notorious \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d recording that threatened to derail his presidential campaign (what an apt ending that would have been: hoisted by his own television mic). Trump\u2019s boasts of groping women without permission, on the way to yet another television appearance, were prefaced by the words, \u201cand when you\u2019re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d The same could apply when you\u2019re president, except you might get impeached for it.", "In politics, too, Trump likes to project the image of being a natural performer. His abilities in MCing a crowd-baiting rally are acknowledged even by his critics, and Trump has regularly mocked Hillary Clinton and others politicians for needing an autocue. Trump boasted he didn\u2019t need one; he was more of an improv kind of guy. Admittedly, his off-the-cuff soliloquies have often been exposed as incoherent verbal diarrhoea when transcribed and scrutinised away from the heat of the rally. As one online critic put it: \u201cI\u2019m not alarmed at the guy launching prodigious verbal farts into a microphone. I\u2019m alarmed at the people laughing and applauding like he\u2019s forming actual thoughts.\u201d Perhaps that is testament to Trump\u2019s powers of performance, but compared with Barack Obama\u2019s carefully structured verbal eloquence, Trump is more like the caller you wish they would cut off on the talk radio show.", "Clearly Trump loves the idea of \u201cbeing a star\u201d, and not just for the sexual predation opportunities, but the stars don\u2019t want him. They flocked around Clinton on the campaign trail \u2013 not that it made any difference (it seems the media underestimated the celebrity wattage of Scott Baio). It looks to be the same post-election: all the stories so far have been about celebrities who have turned down the invitation to appear at his inauguration. They don\u2019t want him in their gang, and he doesn\u2019t like it.", "In 2007, Trump received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame \u2013 confirmation, despite so much criticism, that he really is a star. \u201cIt was something that was given to me by some very powerful people in Hollywood and I\u2019m very honoured by it,\u201d he said at the time. But in recent months, Trump\u2019s star has been repeatedly vandalised. It has had graffiti sprayed on it, including a Nazi swastika, people have taken selfies raising their middle fingers to it, spitting on it, urinating on it, or letting their dogs shit on it. In July last year, an artist built a miniature wall around Trump\u2019s star, topped with razor wire and tiny border signs saying \u201cKeep Out\u201d. And last October, a man disguised as a construction worker took a sledgehammer to it. He had intended to remove it and auction it off to raise funds for the women who accused Trump of groping them. Ronald Reagan\u2019s star never had to put up with this.", "This is by no means the first time \u201cliberal Hollywood\u201d has spoken out on presidential candidates and their fitness for office. Streep\u2019s speech stirs memories of 2003, when Michael Moore was the sole voice of dissent against George W Bush, who was about to launch the Iraq war. Accepting his best documentary Oscar for Bowling For Columbine, Moore stated: \u201cWe live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president. We have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons.\u201d His speech was cut short by the music and he was ushered off stage shortly after. Again \u201cliberal Hollywood\u201d was condemned, and Moore received death threats. President Bush maintained a silence that could possibly be characterised as dignified. But unlike Trump, Bush had little public image to maintain. He ran away from the limelight rather than towards it.", "So no wonder Trump hates Meryl Streep and all she stands for. And the \u201clying media\u201d that faithfully reports facts unfavourable towards the president elect. But perhaps she has found the way to really get under his skin. Perhaps the Foreign Press Association has more of a role to play in the Trump resistance than it dared imagine. He can take all the criticism political commentators can throw at him, but if there\u2019s one thing Trump hates, it\u2019s a bad review."], "targetTitle": "Meryl Streep has hit on star-struck Trump\u2019s big weakness", "postTimestamp": "Mon Jan 09 18:15:10 +0000 2017", "targetKeywords": "Meryl Streep,Donald Trump,US news,Film,Golden Globes 2017,Golden Globes,Awards and prizes,US politics,World news,Culture", "targetDescription": "Calling the president-elect racist, sexist or a bully doesn\u2019t hit home.

The current terms end in summer 2019, so if United decide to exercise the option the Liverpudlian would be at Old Trafford as he approaches his 35th birthday.", "Rooney wants to stay on but will United do it? Will the forward be given an extra season to add to his goals for the club? This is what fascinates about the late-career Rooney: how long can he go on performing for United?", "The 31-year-old lit up the 4-0 victory against Jaap Stam\u2019s team that put the FA\u00a0Cup holders into the fourth round. His was an all-round display of finishing and creativity in the classic No10 mould as he tormented Reading all afternoon.", "However, this is a player whose form has been poor all term \u2013 his seventh-minute opener was only a fourth goal this season \u2013 and who is no longer a regular in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s strongest XI. At 31 any remnants of the youthful zip that tore through defences is gone. And he is a calmer footballer than the once quick-to-anger force of nature who constantly performed on the edge.", "So, how many more goals for him for United? After the strike off the top of his knee which put Rooney alongside Sir Bobby Charlton, he is almost certain to move on to 250 goals and stand alone at the head of the charts. He is also, of course, already England\u2019s record marksman with 53 goals in 119 appearances.", "To be leading scorer for club and country is an inarguable statement of quality. So longevity is the next challenge. Afterwards Rooney offered a tacit acknowledgment of this, his most illuminating reaction to reaching the 249 being when he said: \u201cI\u2019m enjoying my football.\u201d", "This pointed reference to having no thoughts of his career being near its end echoed the statement he issued following the pictures of him being out late when on England duty. Then, Rooney felt moved to call his treatment \u201cdisgraceful\u201d as he said: \u201cIt feels as if the media are trying to write my obituary and I won\u2019t let that happen. It\u2019s not finished yet.\u201d", "Rooney-battering has become an unpalatable national quasi-pastime. He constantly hears how he is not the footballer he once was. The eagerness to play on at United beyond his current contract will hardly please his detractors yet his enthusiasm is admirable considering the 15 years at the very top amid the constant stream of negativity.", "Rooney may be more appreciated by his critics when he does finally retire. Yet as Marcus Rashford, who scored twice on Saturday, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable achievement. If you look back at all the games he\u2019s played and all the goals he\u2019s scored for the club, it\u2019s amazing and, for young players coming up and any striker growing up, then it\u2019s amazing for them to be able to watch him. We all have to [enjoy] the [record-breaking] moment once it goes in.\u201d", "Rooney\u2019s dressing-room influence is viewed as a key asset by Mourinho and it is also acknowledged by senior squad members. As Daley Blind, a seasoned and, in his own way, similarly versatile operator for United and Holland, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great for Wayne with how many goals he\u2019s scored. He\u2019s a great personality and a great legend at the club. I\u2019m happy for him.\u201d", "At the moment it appears unlikely United will trigger the 12-month extension. But this is football and Rooney is a special player, so who knows? For him to force his way back and become integral to United again would surely thrill anyone who is invigorated by sport\u2019s romance.", "For the time being witnessing Rooney reach 250 strikes, whenever he reaches the milestone, should suffice. Mourinho has said a changed side will face Hull in Tuesday\u2019s EFL Cup semi-final first leg so it may not be then.", "However, the next visitors to Old Trafford are Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday.

The difference is that Mr. LeVert, 22, who grew up in Columbus, Ohio, takes it all in from his 45th-floor apartment in Downtown Brooklyn. Last June, Mr. LeVert, a star basketball player at Michigan, was selected by the Indiana Pacers as a first-round pick in the N.B.A. draft; two weeks later, he was traded to the Brooklyn Nets. Mr. LeVert sat out the beginning of the season with a foot injury and did not suit up until December; since then, he has averaged 4.3 points and 15.4 minutes a game in his first 13 games. The Nets have a busy schedule, but whenever Mr. LeVert has downtime, he likes to explore his new hometown.", "PROTOCOL I\u2019m a rookie basketball player, so a lot of my life revolves around the team. If the team is at home, and we don\u2019t have a game that night, I get up and go straight to our training facility, down in Sunset Park. Until recently, I was putting in part-time practices because of my foot, but I also have to do a lot of rehab with our trainers and doctors. So I\u2019m usually the first one there and the last one out. Fortunately, the Nets have cooks and dietitians on site, so I can get a good breakfast. I like the usual stuff, bacon, eggs, fruit, toast.", "PLAYGROUND GAMES My apartment looks west over Lower Manhattan down to Governors Island, and then north toward Queens and the Bronx. Before I moved here, I\u2019d only been to New York a few times, usually for basketball tournaments, so I didn\u2019t exactly have time to get out. Now I can explore a bit. I just found the Cage, in the West Village, which is famous for pickup basketball games. Sometimes I just stop by places like that, talk to guys on the court. I love how basketball can be this really competitive thing, but also it can be a couple of friends shooting hoops on the playground.", "WOW FACTOR When I have a few hours, I like to go check out a part of the city I\u2019ve never seen.

There are so many options, I try to not even focus on specific brands when shopping in the city. One of the things I love the most about New York is the heightened sense of fashion. In college, you just threw on some sweats and headed out. Here, every time you step out the door you\u2019re making a statement. One thing I do like is Flight Club, the shoe store on Broadway. I\u2019m a huge fan of Air Jordans.", "FAN IN A SPORTS TOWN I grew up wanting to play football; I didn\u2019t start playing basketball until high school. I still love watching it. If I can, I\u2019ll find a sports bar or somewhere to watch a game \u2014 drinking lemonade, of course. I love that New York is an all-around sports town.", "SEAFOOD SPOTS My mom is a retired teacher, so she comes to visit a lot. She loves to go out and see the city. We go out to dinner; we go shopping together. She loves seafood, and New York has way better seafood options than central Ohio, so we take advantage of that.", "TEAM CENTRAL If there\u2019s no game, and we don\u2019t have to travel, I usually come back home and relax. I hear when the Nets first moved to Brooklyn, most of the players still lived in New Jersey. But now pretty much the entire team lives in Brooklyn. Isaiah Whitehead was born and raised out here. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Chris McCullough, Joe Harris, Jeremy Lin, Justin Hamilton, Trevor Booker and Luis Scola all live here.", "TYPICAL 20-SOMETHINGS Our guys love Brooklyn, the culture and vibe really match well with our personal styles and team dynamic. Sometimes we go out to a charity event or a press gig, but otherwise, they\u2019ll come over \u2014 we\u2019ll order food and play Madden football, or watch TV.

About 13% of parents around age 50 reported paying off their children's student loans.", "They're also borrowing more. From the 1995-96 academic year to the 2015-16 academic year, borrowers for Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students went up 56%, according to the College Board, and the amount borrowed has leaped from $3.6 billion to $12 billion.", "We worry about the potential consequences of taking on student loan debt at a time when these parents should be saving for retirement and paying down their own debt, says study co-author Jennifer Ailshire, Ph.D., an assistant professor of gerontology at USC. Some parents may choose to delay retirement as a result of needing to save more or pay down more debt.", " Shutterstock", "The parents taking on the most student loan repayments tend to be parents who are black, who have two children 17 or older with college-related debt, are college graduates themselves and are either upper-middle or high income earners.", "On average, parents are paying back about $21,000 in college-related debt, although high-income parents are taking on about $30,000 for their children.", "While it is admirable for parents to sacrifice to help their children pay for college, parents need to be careful to avoid overborrowing, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and VP of strategy for college search and scholarship site Cappex.com. Just as students should borrow no more than their annual starting salary, parents should borrow no more for all their children than their annual income.", "One of the catalysts behind increased parent borrowing may be that federal student loans have annual and aggregate loan limits, Kantrowitz says. Federal student loan limits were last increased in 2008, he says. When students reach the federal student loan limits, their main options are Federal Parent PLUS loans and private student and parent loans.", "Even private parent loans are a relatively new category of lending. Wells Fargo created the private parent loan in 2010, and several other lenders started offering them in 2015.", "As college costs have increased, so has usage of parent loans. Students are three times as likely to get Federal Parent PLUS loans at colleges that cost $25,000 or more as compared with lower-cost colleges (18.8% vs. 6.0%). And students are twice as likely to get Federal Parent PLUS loans at private non-profit colleges than at public or private for-profit colleges (17% vs. 6.9% vs. 8.5%).", "When choosing a college, students and parents should compare their available resources, including savings, private scholarships, contributions from income, education tax benefits and reasonable education debt, with the four-year net price of college, Kantrowitz says. If the net price exceeds available resources, the college is unaffordable. So, some of the excessive debt at graduation is due to families sending their children to colleges they really can't afford.", "It's also important that parents taking on student loans for their children consider the long-term consequences of the debt. Can they pay off those loans before retirement? We are seeing an increase in the number of older adults whose social security benefit is being reduced as a result of outstanding student loan balances, Ailshire says. Take stock of your retirement financial picture before committing to paying for your children's college education by taking out loans or tapping assets that may be needed later.", "It is surprising that parents have a similar amount of loan debt for their children as students themselves have, considering that most of the conversation surrounding the student loan debt crisis has focused almost exclusively on young adults with loan debt, Ailshire says. We clearly need to include parents in these conversations as well.", " "], "targetTitle": "More Parents Taking On Their Kids' College Debt", "postTimestamp": "Sun Jan 08 01:00:01 +0000 2017", "targetKeywords": "", "targetDescription": "A growing number of parents of children ages 17 and older say they\u2019re repaying their children\u2019s college debt, according to a new analysis by USC researchers.

That\u2019s because job growth rates are heavily shaped by two things that a president can\u2019t control: the state of the economy when they take office, and demographic forces that shape the availability of workers.", "Here, Presidents Reagan and Clinton had a big advantage. Both took office not long after a recession had ended, meaning that their job growth results were boosted by unemployed workers who were returning to the work force. And both presided during a time when baby boomers were in prime working years and women were entering the work force.", "By contrast, both President Bushes took office with the economy at full employment, when there was nowhere for job growth to go but down. And President Obama took office during a period of economic disaster, with less favorable demographics: Baby boomers are now retiring, and the proportion of women who seek to work is stable, not growing.", "One way to filter out those effects is by looking at the unemployment rate, which captures only the share of people who are looking for a job who can\u2019t find one.", "The average jobless rate during the Obama presidency is quite high by modern standards, at 7.4 percent. Even amid the miserable job growth record of the George W. Bush administration, the jobless rate averaged only 5.2 percent.", "The sheer depth of the recession that Mr. Obama inherited, combined with the slow, long slog out of it over which he presided, ensured that the jobless rate was, on average, elevated through his presidency.", "While the unemployment rate has been elevated during the Obama presidency, only Bill Clinton and Lyndon B. Johnson handed off a lower rate to their successor.", "If you look not at the average, but compare the economy a president inherited with the one he passed along to his successor, President Obama\u2019s record looks a great deal better. If the December jobless number is unchanged in January, Donald J. Trump will inherit among the lowest jobless rates of any new president in modern times. Only Richard Nixon and George W. Bush inherited a lower rate.", "And the 3.1-percentage-point decline in joblessness over President Obama\u2019s eight years ties with Mr. Clinton for the steepest drop during a presidency in the post-World War II era.", "Looking only at the unemployment rate, especially at the tail end of the administration, may be too generous to the Obama record. That rate only counts people who are actively seeking work. And one of the big stories of the last several years has been a contraction in the share of Americans who even count themselves as part of the labor force.", "But how to measure that? One way is to look at the share of the adult population that is working, or counts itself as part of the labor force. But if you do that, you fail to account for people who are not in the labor force for completely sensible reasons \u2014 because they are voluntarily retiring, or going to graduate school, and so on.", "That\u2019s why economists often look at \u201cprime-age\u201d labor force participation, only the share of people between ages of 25 and 54 who are either working or seeking work.", "But here also, it is tricky to compare shifts in recent years with earlier decades, when women were entering the work force at high rates. That shift, which took place roughly from the 1960s through 2000, fueled a boom in the rate of labor force participation that hasn\u2019t continued in the last 16 years partly because most of the women who want to be part of the labor force already are.", "But what if we look just at the labor force participation rate among prime-aged men? How do the Obama years stack up?", "It\u2019s pretty bad. The proportion of men 25 to 54 who are part of the labor force has fallen by 1.4 percentage points during the last eight years.", "What is less widely understood, though, is that this shift isn\u2019t some new phenomenon of the Obama era. That same measure fell by 1.7 percentage points during the eight years of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Even during the boom years of the Clinton administration, it fell by 0.9 percentage points.", "Going back even further, when America\u2019s postwar economy was going strong, the proportion of prime-age men in the labor force was falling. In the Nixon years, the number fell by 1.8 percentage points, more than twice the rate on a per-year basis as in the Obama administration.", "In other words, during the Obama administration, more men, even of prime working age, have dropped out of the labor force, and this is one of the most worrisome long-term trends in the economy. But it has been more of a continuation of a long-term pattern than something new.", "So what is the Obama jobs legacy? The administration succeeded in ending the steepest recession in modern times, and has presided over steady job growth for seven of its eight years \u2014 though less impressive than in some other recent administrations.", "The slow recovery meant an elevated unemployment rate, but President Obama will hand off to his successor an economy near full employment, something only a few modern presidents have accomplished."], "targetTitle": "How Obama\u2019s Jobs Record Stacks Up ", "postTimestamp": "Sat Jan 07 09:06:21 +0000 2017", "targetKeywords": "Labor and Jobs,Unemployment,United States Economy,Obama  Barack,Economic Conditions and Trends", "targetDescription": "Comparing his performance with that of other presidents: Things could have been much worse, and at the start, they were."}

You start to nod off at the wheel; it taps you on the shoulder and starts up a conversation.", "This unconventional interplay between the driver and automobile is central to concept cars that Honda and Toyota unveiled at the annual CES technology conference in Las Vegas this week. In the not-so-distant future, vehicles will not only be safer or more efficient. They will be our companion, watching our every move.", "These cars, which only exist today as partially functional concepts, will use powerful artificial intelligence systems to memorize and store information about every passengers\u2019 likes and dislikes, how they speak, and the places they frequent, all to make decisions the car feels are in the riders\u2019 interest.", "The auto industry\u2019s pursuit of a hyper-personal experience comes as the very nature of automotive transportation is in flux. Many industry observers expect ride-sharing services will become more popular, with autonomous driving to follow. People may rely less on personal cars to get around, a prospect that is \u201cgoing to change the business model of private car ownership dramatically,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a Kelley Blue Book analyst.", "With the basic business of buying and selling cars potentially facing a major change in the decades ahead, information about drivers and passengers is likely to hold tremendous value for automakers. While this may also lead to greater convenience for motorists, it creates yet another platform where our most sensitive data could be susceptible to privacy infringement and security hacks.", "\u201cArtificial intelligence and big data will make vehicles one of the most important windows into the habits of consumers next to their own phones and computers,\u201d said Ed Hellwig, the executive editor at Edmunds.com. \u201cAutomakers will know more than they ever have about how their vehicles are used, which could lead to entirely new designs and features.\u201d", "As with concept cars past, Toyota and Honda\u2019s new vehicles could be seen as quixotic playthings for car heads and tech geeks. Concept cars are built to introduce bold ideas, practical and otherwise. But Robert Carter, Toyota\u2019s senior vice president of automotive operations, told an audience at CES on Wednesday that components of its concept car will be tested on roads in Japan in the coming years.", "What\u2019s more, nearly all of the concepts are rooted in technology already being honed today. Start-ups and legacy automakers alike are testing applications for artificial intelligence and big data inside cars, and connecting those systems with your phone, home appliances and the other Internet-enabled devices that permeate our daily lives.", "\u201cTechnology moves very slow until suddenly it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Shawn DuBravac, a futurist and chief economist at the Consumer Technology Association. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like boiling water.

Once Yui learns preferences for music, temperature, seat position and other features, it will automatically adjust settings before the driver even climbs in.", "Yui will also scroll through social media channels to create \u201cserendipitous\u201d moments, such as recognizing that friends have checked into a local restaurant and suggesting a stop there to grab a bite as well.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all subtle stuff but the ultimate goal is to not have you aware that a lot of this stuff is happening.

The artificial intelligence assistant listens to the driver\u2019s phone conversations, automatically updating their calendar and route if plans change. If the driver is running late for a meeting, the car finds the fastest route. When there is time to spare, it might suggest stopping for coffee.", "\u201cThe whole philosophy behind it is to create a much more emotional, human connection,\u201d said Nick Renner, the NeuV project leader.", "The auto industry may be taking its cues from phone companies. Smartphones have evolved into personal lifelines that facilitate human interactions, make people\u2019s lives more convenient, and store valuable information. That cars will one day have that same potential seems only natural considering the amount of time people spend inside them each day.", "[This car promises to be fully electric and drive itself. Will that be enough?]", "The reimagining of cars and how we interact with them started from the inside out, a break from the past when a sleek exterior and under-the-hood innovations took precedent, Chergosky said.", "\u201cFor many decades, car design was really focused on the mechanics of the car and on the manufacture,\u201d said Wendy Ju, executive director at Stanford\u2019s Center for Design Research. \u201cIn many ways, the in-car user experience was an afterthought; it needed to be good enough to be safe, or flashy enough to be featured, but the interaction was shallow.\u201d", "In the near future, what your car learns about you could provide car companies lucrative new opportunities. A September 2016 report from consulting firm McKinsey estimates that carmakers could reap between $450 billion and $750 billion in revenue by 2030 from using car-generated data to develop new products and services.", "While much of that conversation is speculative, analysts say it\u2019s not hard to imagine targeted advertising inside the car, or apps that allow people to make dinner reservations, buy merchandise or play games. That\u2019s especially true as cars become more autonomous and occupants devote less attention to the vehicle\u2019s actual operation.", "Again, consumers shouldn\u2019t expect to find all of these technologies as advertised on showroom floors anytime soon, or perhaps ever. Toyota envisions its concept car being realized by 2030, for example. Instead, they indicate where automakers see consumer needs and expectations moving in the coming decades.", "\u201cLike most concept cars, the vehicles at CES are eye-catching platforms for the behind-the-scenes technology that is still years away,\u201d Hellwig said.", "But some of the technology isn\u2019t so far off. Ford announced Wednesday that its drivers who use Amazon Echo will be able to tell the bot\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa, to start their car remotely. (Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Prior to Yes, only Pink Floyd and Genesis have been inducted, which he feels is a slight on both the form and its fans. \"I'm so disgusted with the way that prog-rock and Yes have been treated,\" says Wakeman, who releases the new album Piano Portraits\u00a0on Jan. 13.", "\"All I'll say is there's some band there and some bands that have been inducted in that I have no idea why they're in there, and there's bans like Yes and a few others and you go, 'Why aren't they in?' It seems that anything to do with prog-rock was considered a dirty word by them, and it's almost like an era of music, despite the fact it's proven to be the most inventive and the most influential music to musicians that there's ever been in the history of rock 'n' roll, and yet it's ignored.

Better Pizza, wasn't having it. I said... 'Take your Papa John's stock, put it under your pillow, and over the next two to three years we'll do you a good job,' he recalled in a 2016 video interview with Purdue University.", "The CEO, often seen in a red shirt emblazoned with he company's logo, delivered on his promise when the stock more than doubled to $19 in early 2012, three years after the investor's call. Shares have more than quadrupled since, enjoying a 58% increase in the last 12 months alone that boosted Schnatter's net worth to about $1 billion. The pizza mogul declined to be interviewed for this article, but said in emailed remarks: As long as our quality and company continue to get better, by nature, we will get bigger.", "In the last three decades, Schnatter has turned the company that he started out of a broom closet in 1984 into a pizza giant with $1.64 billion sales in 2015 from more than 4,900 locations in 44 countries and territories.", "He's very passionate about (Papa John's) and takes a lot of pride in the performance of the company, said Peter Saleh, a managing director at financial services firm BTIG. I think he's a visionary that keeps this engine humming along.", "Becoming Papa John's", "Forbes was able to put together a timeline of Schnatter's career using four video interviews and feedback from Papa John's press office.", "The great-grandson of a German immigrant who arrived in the U.S. in 1867, Schnatter grew up among entrepreneurs. His grandfather owned three successful businesses, while his father started 20 outfits that all faltered. At age 8 Schnatter founded a grass-cutting company with his younger brother, and at age 12 a gutter-painting startup.", "Three years later, Schnatter landed a job as a dishwasher at Rocky's Sub Pub, a restaurant in his hometown of Jeffersonville, Ind. where he was eventually allowed to make pizzas. I just fell in love with it, he said in an interview with CNBC. While at Rocky's, Schnatter bought a 1972 Camaro Z28 for $1,600.", "He graduated from Indiana's Ball State University in 1983 with a business degree but struggled to find work. So in early September of that year, Schnatter turned to managing his father's pub, Mick's Lounge, which he has described as the dirtiest, nastiest, stinkiest ... beer joint in the world.", "The bar had racked up $64,000 in debt, so Schnatter sold his Camaro for $2,800 a month after joining the company to pay the bar's employees and buy beer for a week. He settled the pub's debts in about 4 months.", "I didn't like the bar business. I didn't like all the fights, all the cussing, the drinking ... but I loved running the business, Schnatter said in the Purdue interview.", "Combining his two passions, Schnatter knocked down the broom closet at Mick's Lounge one day in 1984 and started selling pizzas out of the back of the bar. A year later he opened the first Papa John's restaurant in Jeffersonville, personally making every pizza during the company's first year in business.", "He just saw an opportunity for someone to offer better pizza, and that consumers would taste the difference, said Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle.", "Papa John's sold its first franchise in 1986 and opened its 100th restaurant five years later. Schnatter took the firm public in June of 1993, listing it as PZZA on NASDAQ.", "In 1991 I didn't have $2,000 to go on vacation. In 1994 the company was worth $200 million, Schnatter said in an interview with CNBC. We literally went from nothing to literally having a lot of blessings in a short period of time. By 2009, Schnatter had enough money to pay $250,000 for the 1972 Camaro he had sold for a couple grand in 1983.", "Making Dough", "Wall Street has continued to salivate over Papa John's, which has achieved a market cap of about $3.2 billion under Schnatter's leadership. Drivers of the growth include the firm's sustained commitment to quality ingredients and its early investment in technology, Slagle said. In 2001, Papa John's became the first pizza chain to offer national online ordering. By the first quarter of 2016, 55% of the chain's orders came in through digital platforms.", "They've worked hard to continue to improve the quality of their product and positioning, Slagle said, They've worked hard investing in technology to be the leader and have the most convenient online ordering app and experience for the consumer and it's paying off.", "Despite its massive success -- the chain hasn't posted a negative same-stores sales number, even during the recession, Saleh said -- Papa John's has only captured about a tenth of the pizza market in the U.S, according to BTIG estimates. Its two largest competitors, Pizza Hut and Domino's, together have seized about 30% to 40% of the pie, with the remaining share in the hands of local and regional pizza joints. But, in Saleh's view, Papa John's could gobble up market share in the future.", "I think their same-store sales are going to continue to be robust and if that's the case I think you're going to see franchisees continue to invest to build new units, Saleh said.", "In his 32 years at Papa John's helm, Schnatter has largely skirted scandals. But he landed in hot water in 2012 for saying the Affordable Care Act would force the company to raise prices by 11 to 14 cents per pizza, a cost he said the company would pass on to consumers. He also received backlash for a comment, which he said was misinterpreted, that seemed to suggest Papa John's would cut employee hours to avoid providing them with health insurance. Shares slumped about 4.2% as the controversy raged on.", "Almost five years later, stockholders seem to have forgotten about Schnatter's comments. The bigger concern among investors would be if and when John retires, said Saleh. People would be concerned (that losing) his vision and his knowledge base would negatively impact the company.", "At least for now, shareholders and pizza fans can breathe easy, as the 55-year-old has no plans to retire, a spokesperson for Papa John's confirmed.", "I have a goal of being the No.1 pizza company in the world, Schnatter said a few years ago. ...I've got all the patience and all the work ethic and all the time in the world to get that done."], "targetTitle": "New Billionaire: How Papa John's CEO John Schnatter Turned Pizza Into Ten-Figure Fortune", "postTimestamp": "Thu Jan 05 17:46:01 +0000 2017", "targetKeywords": "", "targetDescription": "In the last three decades, John Schnatter has built a pizza empire that spans 44 countries and territories, racking up a fortune of about $1 billion."}

Yet another terrorist attack took place today in Baghdad, the latest in a series of such atrocities that have hit the capital and other parts of the country over the past week. Isis is undergoing a losing battle in Mosul, its last remaining stronghold in Iraq, and it is expected to lose control of the city in the coming months. However, it still has a deadly capacity to carry out terrorist acts. Even without its so-called caliphate, Isis will continue to undermine stability in the country.", "The bombings over the past week have barely registered in the international media and the conscience of the international community. The problem is in part a result of war becoming the new normal in Iraq, which has been embroiled in terrorism for more than a decade; but also largely because conflict continues to be framed as political by the international community and media, which attribute the emergence of Isis, suicide attacks and conflict more generally to the lack of good governance and a series of disastrous policies adopted both during and after the US occupation.", "This simplification and reduction of terrorist attacks in Iraq to a matter of politics, however, has not been without its consequences. Iraq fell off the radar because of western fatigue and reluctance to continue engaging with, and investing in, Iraq\u2019s dysfunctional political process. Sectarian divisions and endemic corruption have also forced governments to shift their resources and energy away from Iraq\u2019s institutions, which in the longer run will widen the space in which militant groups thrive. The incoming Trump administration, for example, has already indicated that it will no longer commit US resources to the rebuilding of the Iraqi state and others in the region.", "Yet there is a failure to realise that Iraq is suffering from more than just political violence and instability. This is a campaign against the country\u2019s array of religious and ethnic groups. Terrorist attacks in Iraq constitute a sustained attack against groups that reject Isis\u2019s warped ideology and interpretation of Islam.", "Jihadi groups such as Isis view Kurds, Yazidis, Christians and other minorities as heretics, but it is their attacks on Iraq\u2019s Shias (who represent Iraq\u2019s majority) that would amount to what the United Nations and other international institutions have described as the factors that collectively constitute a genocide: namely, \u201cthe deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic, racial, religious or national group\u201d.", "The targets, scale and frequency of the bombings directed at Iraq\u2019s predominantly Shia neighbourhoods, and the intent behind them, readily fall within these parameters. Humanitarian organisations often highlight the death toll in Iraq, which almost always numbers hundreds of fatalities a month and the wounding of many more. Yet these statistics largely reflect attacks on Shia neighbourhoods, shrines, holy cities and pilgrimages.", "In addition to weekly strikes on Shia communities, there have been even more deadly coordinated strikes. In July 2016 Isis hit a Shia district of Baghdad and killed more than 300 people. When Isis took control of northern Iraq in 2014, Shias were the victims of its deadliest attack in recent years: more than a thousand Shia army recruits and air cadets were separated from their colleagues, tortured and killed in cold blood in what has since become known as the Camp Speicher massacre.", "Isis\u2019s effectiveness also lies in its ability to frame its genocidal campaign against the Shias as a medium through which other grievances can be addressed by broader sections of the Arab Sunni population, who may have issues that go beyond religion \u2013 be they political, economic or otherwise.", "Generally, the problem for policymakers and politicians is that once the term genocide is deployed, it increases the pressure for action. For example, Iraq\u2019s Yazidis have been targeted incessantly over the past decade. In a single coordinated attack in 2007, al-Qaida in Iraq \u2013 the forerunner to Isis \u2013 killed more than 700 Yazidis. Yet it was only after Isis seized control of Sinjar, in northern Iraq, in June 2014 and the US-led campaign to defeat the jihadis was launched that crimes against the Yazidi community were recognised as genocide by a number of governments and international institutions.", "The campaign against Isis will only ever be half completed if international resources end with the military effort. Acknowledging the continuing attacks on Iraq\u2019s Shias as a genocide is not just a moral imperative: it will also help enable the legal and political mechanisms through which such atrocities are better confronted. Only then can popular opinion be mobilised in favour of the good governance and stabilisation efforts in the country that will ultimately remedy humanitarian crises in the region \u2013 and prevent groups like Isis from re-emerging in the future."], "targetTitle": "The Isis campaign against Iraq\u2019s Shia Muslims is not politics.

Robert G.

Howell (R-Stafford).", "A spokesman for Howell, Christopher E. West, was highly dismissive. \u201cThat\u2019s just Bob being Bob,\u201d West said. \u201cHe knows the House doesn\u2019t operate that way.\u201d", "Even if the bill passed the GOP-controlled General Assembly, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) would veto it.", "\u201cGovernor McAuliffe has been clear that he will veto any bill that restricts the rights of Virginians based on sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said in a written statement. \u201cAs we saw in North Carolina, these bills don\u2019t just hamper civil rights \u2014 they kill jobs. The Governor is hopeful that Republicans in the General Assembly will drop these counterproductive bills and turn their focus toward building a stronger and more equal Virginia economy.\u201d", "Marshall\u2019s proposal drew praise from the conservative Virginia First Foundation. The group issued a written statement from board member Travis Witt, the pastor of Gilboa Christian Church in rural Mineral and the former chairman of the Virginia Tea Party Patriots Federation.", "\u201cPublic school facilities are not the place for social experiments that permit early exposure to sexual issues when there is ample evidence that such exposure can lead to long term developmental damage,\u201d his statement said. It noted that the bill \u201cmakes adequate provisions for children seeking single-use restrooms when needed and ensures that children are not forced to experience forced physical exposure to the opposite sex against their will.\u201d", "One of the most outspoken conservatives in the General Assembly, Marshall often rankles GOP leadership with bills to regulate social issues \u2014 which just as often die in committee. Among Marshall\u2019s other bills this year is one that would declare pornography a public health hazard.", "The bill comes as the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case filed by transgender student Gavin Grimm, now a senior at Gloucester High in Gloucester, Va., who sued the school board in 2015 after it passed a policy barring him from using the boy\u2019s bathroom. In April, a federal appeals court ruled in Grimm\u2019s favor, citing the Obama administration\u2019s position that such bathroom restrictions are a violation of Title IX, which bars sex discrimination in public schools. But the incoming Trump administration may stake out a different position, in which case the Supreme Court could remand the case to a lower court.", "Legislatures around the country have clashed over transgender issues in recent years. North Carolina\u2019s so called \u201cbathroom bill\u201d immediately ignited a firestorm, causing businesses like PayPal and Deutsche Bank to abandon expansions and prompting the NCAA and NBA to relocate sporting events. The bill also spurred a series of lawsuits, including dueling suits filed by the state and the Justice Department.", "It appeared the law may have been on its way out late last month, when North Carolina lawmakers met for a special session specifically so they could rescind the measure. However, after an acrimonious day that saw Republicans feud over whether to fully or partially repeal the bill, they left it in place, prompting scathing criticism from Gov. Roy Cooper (D) as well as from gay and transgender rights groups.", "Political analysts were dubious that Virginia will replay North Carolina\u2019s script on the bathroom bill.", "\u201cI would bet my bottom dollar that we will never see such a bill emerge from the legislature,\u201d said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. \u201cThe Senate would kill it, even if the House passes it. I doubt it even gets out of the House.\u201d", "Sabato said that the bill would face an almost automatic veto from McAuliffe. Democrats, he said, would be eager to use such a veto to highlight to Virginians what one-party Republican rule could mean for the state.", "University leaders appeared to be leery of wading into the debate. Most are probably anxious to avoid generating friction with lawmakers as Richmond weighs other issues that affect their schools, including public financing of higher education.", "Peter Blake, director of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, declined through a spokesman to comment, saying he had not yet reviewed Marshall\u2019s proposal.", "\u201cWe tend to follow pretty faithfully a rule of not commenting on proposed legislation, particularly at the start of the General Assembly, when there are so many bills out there and it\u2019s impossible to say what might move forward,\u201d said Justin Pope, chief of staff at Longwood University, a public institution in Farmville.", "Representatives of the state flagship University of Virginia, the College of William and Mary and other prominent public universities did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.", "James Parrish, executive director of Equality Virginia, said the bill \u201cwould cause immediate harm to our transgender community and economy.\u201d", "State Sen. Adam P.

Last played in May 2016, the contest returns this month and promises to put observers right inside the action of ye olden tymes as they enjoy breathtaking views uttered in front of a backdrop of breathtaking views. Think of it as a sort of Westworld for golf, shot on a cost of \u00a380m to the local economy, which is what estimations reckon hosting the Open would be worth. I\u2019m not saying the row is comically quaint but you wouldn\u2019t rule out hearing that during its course, someone or other had furiously cast his periwig to the floor.", "A personal highlights reel from last time around would include interventions from Peter Alliss, who appeared to regard the Muirfield facilities as so superlative that they were worth entering into a high-stakes bargain for. \u201cIf someone wants to join,\u201d he mused, \u201cwell, you\u2019d better get married to someone who\u2019s a member.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you, but I think if I were to enter into a marriage of state, I\u2019d require in return something like dibs on the Habsburg empire, as opposed to the chance of a silent G&T in the 19th with a man who switches channel when Cialis adverts come on.", "Anyway, other standout moments from last May\u2019s failed revolution included a leaked letter from those bitterly opposed to admitting women, who were wetting their collective pants about a number of \u201cthe risks\u201d of female membership. Primarily, these appeared to pose the greatest danger to the men\u2019s \u201clunch arrangements\u201d, which were mentioned not once but twice, and\u00a0fretfully.", "\u201cWe are not an ordinary club,\u201d ran one instance of this preoccupation. \u201cOur special nature; \u2018a gentleman\u2019s club where golf is played\u2019 is quite unique with its fraternity built inter alia on foursomes play with a round taking only the same time as lunch and leaving enough time for a further round after lunch [even in mid-winter].

Perhaps the modernisers have managed to sway the requisite few of the old guard round to their way of thinking. Perhaps an enterprising reporter will find themselves at the right snug bar exit at the right time and manage to elicit another targeted intervention by scratch civil rights activist Alliss. Perhaps a new leaked letter will reveal anxiety about what female influence will do to Muirfield\u2019s miraculously idiosyncratic drinks ordering conventions or make its inevitable journey to the issue of transgender bathrooms. Then again, perhaps one or two members have decided they like golf more than clubs and consequently would actually quite like the chance to see it played at its highest level in an Open on their home course. The last thing any of them need worry about is the notion that what they do really matters now.", "On club membership, I am an unapologetic Marxist (Groucho, not Karl), and since the R&A have rightly removed Muirfield from the Open rota, this spectacle has become much more self-harming than anything else. Indeed, the good gentlemen of Muirfield should be under absolutely no illusion: watching their twice-yearly insistence on making pillocks of themselves is a hundred times more entertaining sport than anything that could be viewed on their course.

No big games are happening on 3 January 2017, no one will instantly sense the change. Could it be, nevertheless, that the date will one day be ranked among the most significant in modern rugby union history? Might it also be the moment the cork is removed from the old-school bottle and, in a spray of sparkling foam, it starts raining tries?", "World Rugby\u2019s decision to tighten the tackle law with immediate effect and clamp down on high, dangerous \u201chits\u201d is meant to be all about improving player welfare. Every minor tweak to rugby\u2019s technical landscape inevitably has a side-effect and suddenly it is defence coaches who face a double-barrelled nightmare. If defenders can no longer risk targeting the upper chest for fear of the impact \u201criding up\u201d and earning them a card, passing out of the tackle becomes far more practicable. The killer offload is suddenly back in vogue.", "Leave aside, for now, the other possible side-effect, namely games ending up with 12 players a side until the \u201csteer clear of the head\u201d mantra fully sinks in.", "Overlook, too, the inconvenience to players of introducing such punitive measures \u2013 and stiffer sanctions \u2013 slap-bang in the middle of the northern hemisphere season.", "Instead, just for a moment, consider the potential consequences should everyone embrace the spirit of the reinforced law as well as its letter. Could lowering the height of the hit, perversely, be rugby\u2019s big-bang moment?", "The possibilities, either way, are intriguing. Even accidental contact with the head is set to attract at least a penalty, as will any challenge that might conceivably be described as reckless. Players will have to change their behaviour and attitudes or risk spending a lot more time in the sin-bin. In the short term, if not longer, there should be more leeway for ball-carriers and try-scoring rates look set to soar.", "Clearly rugby is about more than tries alone \u2013 low-scoring slugfests can sometimes be the most compelling of all \u2013 but in terms of allowing gifted athletes a fraction more scope to display their skills, this may turn out to be the most significant shift since the introduction of the five-point try in 1992. Something had to be done to protect diminutive playmakers and as long as players do not appeal loudly to the referee every time an arm inadvertently grazes their cheeks, it should enhance the prospects of teams who aspire to play a bit more rugby.", "With the majority of pitches also improving, there is already evidence to suggest greater ambition is not necessarily incompatible with success. Take a look at the Premiership table. Before last weekend only three clubs in the competition boasted a worse defensive record in terms of tries scored than Wasps, who have conceded 31 tries in 12 games.", "Yet Dai Young\u2019s side still sit atop the table, having scored 48 tries at the other end: the same as they managed in the whole of the 2013-14 season. At their current strike rate they stand a decent chance of overhauling Newcastle\u2019s record for a 22-game Premiership season of 85 tries, set in 1997-98, when professionalism was in its infancy and defences were nowhere near as organised.", "Even Richmond\u2019s longstanding mark of 96 tries in 26 games in 1998-99 could conceivably be within range, particularly if their opponents also sense attack is their best form of defence. In days gone by, Northampton would have felt quietly happy to have conceded only 16 tries in their dozen games yet, before Sunday\u2019s narrow win at Gloucester, they were languishing in eighth place. The reason? Their modest tally of 18 tries scored is four fewer than the bottom-placed Bristol. Defending stoutly is not enough on its own.", "It is a similar story in the Pro12, where the second-placed Ospreys, despite Sunday\u2019s low-scoring encounter against the Dragons, have scored 47 tries in their 12 games. Last season they scored only 55 in 22 matches. There is a lesson here for the Lions this summer, given that New Zealand pretty much always keep the scoreboard ticking. Since 2010 the All Blacks have failed to reach 20 points only six times in 94 Tests; even scoring 25 points against them is no guarantee of victory. Hence the reason why the remarkable individual finishing of Denny Solomona, Semesa Rokoduguni, Tom Varndell and Christian Wade either side of Christmas should not be casually dismissed. Players capable of making good defences look silly are coming back into fashion.", "We are still waiting, even so, for any team to outdo the greatest try of all, scored by the Barbarians against New Zealand in January 1973. The unpromising field position, Phil Bennett\u2019s stepping sorcery, the musketeering support runners, the quality of the opposition \u2026 it would have merited a standing ovation had Gareth Edwards merely loped over the line unchallenged. What made it extra special, of course, was Edwards\u2019 glorious surge of acceleration on to Derek Quinnell\u2019s pass followed by that exhilarating full-body diving stretch past Grant Batty to score in the corner.", "The game has moved on but the grainy replays still stand the test of time. Perhaps, 44 years on, scintillating attacking play is poised for a glorious comeback.", "How sad and painful for all concerned to see a downcast Manu Tuilagi limp off with a worrying knee injury on New Year\u2019s Day, just when he was looking forward to a happier, healthier 2017. With the Vunipola brothers already likely to be out of the Six Nations, George Kruis nursing a fractured cheekbone and Joe Launchbury sidelined by a calf injury, England have some sizeable holes to fill; it will also not have escaped Eddie Jones\u2019s notice that this time the players were injured on a club weekend before an international camp rather than vice-versa. Happily, England have no lack of depth \u2026 below are five potential XVs made up of players who have either worn the white jersey or nurse ambitions to make the 2019 Rugby World Cup squad. It will be a while yet before Jones\u2019s squad are down to their bare bones \u2026", "A) Brown; Nowell, Joseph, Farrell, May; Ford, B Youngs; M Vunipola, Hartley, Cole, Itoje, Kruis, Robshaw, Haskell, B Vunipola.", "B) Goode; A Watson, Daly, Tuilagi, Yarde; Lozowski, Care; Marler, George, Sinckler, Launchbury, Lawes, Wood, S Jones, Hughes.", "C) Haley; Rokoduguni, Slade, Te\u2019o, Wade; Cipriani, Robson; Genge, Taylor, Hill, Attwood, Ewels, Williams, Harrison, Clifford.", "D) Abendanon; Ashton, Barritt, Eastmond, Strettle; F Burns, Spencer; Mullan, Cowan-Dickie, Brookes, Lees, Beaumont, Armand, Kvesic, Morgan.", "E) M Tait; M Watson, Marchant, Twelvetrees, Charnley; Mallinder, Simpson; Catt, T Youngs, Cooper-Woolley, Kitchener, Slater, Wray, Underhill, Wilson.", "In a different era it was Carlos Spencer\u2019s trademark, a trick only a supremely gifted and confident fly-half could hope to perform. Hats off, then, to Gareth Steenson of Exeter for the through-the-legs reverse pass that set up James Short for the Chiefs\u2019 winning try at Bath on New Year\u2019s Eve.

United recently announced its new basic economy category, a rock-bottom fare that comes with some sacrifices. For example, you can only bring on board a personal item (no overhead bag), and you can\u2019t choose your seat (the airline plays fairy godmother, or wicked witch, at check-in).

The Obama foreign policy era, however, is ending very differently: in a fit of two-fingered pique at the United Nations against Israel and its prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The loser, though, won\u2019t be Israel or Netanyahu; if\u00a0anything, it\u2019ll be the UN.", "The pique, of course, won\u2019t make a scrap of difference. The only criticism a rational individual might make of Obama\u2019s decision to allow the now notorious Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement expansion to pass is, \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d\u00a0Israeli settlement expansion has for decades been a thorn in the side of US presidents trying to broker Middle East peace. The otherwise unanimous passage of the resolution only proves how the rest of the world overwhelmingly feels that way as well.", "But then again, even harder for a rational individual to fathom is Congress\u2019s unquestioning lockstep support for Israel \u2013 support that Netanyahu has brazenly exploited in his years of feuding with Obama.\u00a0Brave indeed is the Representative or Senator who dares criticise the Jewish state.", "In any case, Donald Trump is riding to the rescue. Having nominated the most pro-settlement US ambassador to Israel in generations, the next president looks set to pursue policies that will delight Netanyahu and the far-right factions on whom he relies to stay in power. Come 20 January, Obama\u2019s gesture will be forgotten. Not so, however, the role of the UN in the affair \u2013\u00a0at least on Capitol Hill.", "Washington\u2019s relationship with the world body 220 miles to its north has often been strained. All too often, the United Nations comes across here as a gang of third world countries getting one back on the biggest kid on the block. The UN was clearing house for opposition to the younger Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq. Washington has used its power to force out secretaries\u00a0generals it did not like, and on occasion refused to pay its dues (some 22 per cent of the total UN budget).", "But of late the going has been smoother. Obama has probably been the most multilaterally minded American president of modern times, and the least inclined to throw his country\u2019s weight around. Three\u00a0weeks hence, however, things will be very different.", "\u00a0A populist, unabashedly \u201cAmerica\u00a0First\u201d\u00a0administration is about to take office, unlike anything the country has seen before. It will be led by a president whose approach to diplomacy will be transactional, and who has an abiding dislike of freeloading international bodies living off on the American shilling.", "Judging by Trump\u2019s rhetoric on the campaign trail, Nato \u2013 that ungrateful group of allies protected by US military might but who were unwilling to pay a fair share for that protection \u2013 had seemed first in line for the treatment. After the Israel vote, that dubious distinction may have passed to the softer target on the banks of the East River.", "For the Washington establishment, Nato remains an article of faith. Not so the UN. Washington is but one of five veto-wielding permanent members on the Security Council. Lopsided votes against US policies on Israel and Cuba have been a constant source of embarrassment. And then there\u2019s the paranoid far-right fringe,\u00a0haunted by visions of black UN helicopters swooping down to take away America\u2019s sovereignty. One may presume it mostly voted for Trump.", "The Israel vote has got the old juices running. Cut back America\u2019s contributions, say some on Capitol Hill. No, suspend them entirely say others. Why not pull out entirely, even argue a few. After all, the UN needs America much more than America needs it. And the UN never does anything anyway.", "Which is, of course, nonsense. Yes, the UN can give a very decent impersonation of bureaucratic ossification, and the incidents of sexual abuse perpetrated against civilians by certain of its peacekeepers are shocking and indefensible. But these peacekeepers, whatever their inadequacies, are carrying out missions that otherwise might have fallen to the US. And to blame the UN for failing to resolve the great crises of the day is absurd.", "The UN is only as effective as its members \u2013 in practice the big five powers with the right of veto on the Security Council \u2013 allow it to be. If the US and Russia, for instance, cannot agree on a peace plan for Syria, war will continue, stymieing the humanitarian efforts of the UN in the process. Into this dysfunctional club now barges Donald Trump, full of talk about pulling the US out of the UN climate deal and the UN-monitored Iran nuclear deal.", "\u00a0As for America not needing the UN, that too is nonsense. Just like his predecessors, Trump will find the world body, for all its deficiencies, a precious forum for negotiation and a vital source of legitimacy (as, for example, for the US-led coalition that drove Iraq from Kuwait in 1991). Dealing with it won\u2019t be easy; indeed it will often be maddeningly frustrating. But it will be worth it.", "And who knows? Things might just work out. Trump\u2019s choice of ambassador is no fire-breathing, tear-down-the-building radical. Nikki Haley, the outgoing governor of South Carolina,\u00a0may be a diplomatic novice, but she\u2019s young, a highly talented politician and a relative moderate by the standards of the Trump team. And by odd coincidence, for the first time since 1953\u00a0a new US President and UN\u00a0Secretary-General will be taking office at the same time.", "Antonio Guterres, an admired former prime minister of Portugal and the longest-ever serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has the makings of a highly effective leader of the UN. Re-establishing the credibility of the organisation in Washington will demand every ounce of his skill. Even then the UN\u2019s performance \u2013 as always \u2013 will depend not on him, but on the willingness of its most important members to make the world body work.", "But if he can, even America\u2019s most ardent UN-haters may be ready to forgive and forget that Israel vote."], "targetTitle": "There will only be one loser in the aftermath of Obama's attack on Israel \u2013 the United Nations", "postTimestamp": "Sun Jan 01 06:31:01 +0000 2017", "targetKeywords": "Donald Trump, Barack Obama, UN Security Council, Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli settlements, Voices", "targetDescription": "It began\u00a0so nobly eight years ago, with exhortations to rid the world of nuclear weapons, and idealistic musings about turning Arabs and Americans into brothers, all capped by an absurdly premature Nobel peace prize.

These ambitions unite us, so that we are no longer the 52% who voted leave and the 48% who voted remain, but one great union of people and nations with a proud history and a bright future. So when I sit around the negotiating table in Europe this year, it will be with that in mind \u2013 the knowledge that I am there to get the right deal not just for those who voted to leave, but for every single person in this country.\u201d", "The prime minister has said she will trigger article 50 by the end of March, launching the formal exit negotiations with the other 27 members of the EU.", "However, the shape of Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU remains a topic on which May is refusing to provide what she has described as a \u201crunning commentary\u201d, leading to concerns across the political spectrum about how negotiations will conclude in two years\u2019 time.", "In recent days the campaign group Leave Means Leave has demanded a \u201cclean, swift\u201d exit amid talk that the government could seek a transitional deal that would in the short term require the UK to abide by freedom of movement obligations, remain subject to the European Court of Justice and reduce its scope to strike trade deals outside Europe.", "In her message May also returns to the claim, made on the steps of No 10 on her first day in office, that her government would prioritise the interests of so-called Jams \u2013 those \u201cjust about managing\u201d. In an apparent reference to the fact that a high proportion of Leave voters came from less affluent groups, she says: \u201cOf course, the referendum laid bare some further divisions in our country \u2013 between those who are prospering, and those who are not \u2026 those for whom our country works well, and those for whom it does not.\u201d", "Concluding her message, May also speaks of the late Labour MP Jo Cox, murdered last year. She says: \u201cAs the fantastic MP Jo Cox, who was so tragically taken from us last year, put it: \u2018We are far more united and have far more in common than that which divides us.\u2019\u201d", "In last year\u2019s new year message from Downing Street, David Cameron promised \u201cto fix the things that most annoy British people about our relationship with the EU\u201d before a referendum."], "targetTitle": "Theresa May\u2019s new year message: I\u2019ll fight remainers\u2019 case in Europe, too", "postTimestamp": "Sat Dec 31 22:06:23 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "Theresa May,EU referendum and Brexit,European Union,Politics,Foreign policy,UK news,Article 50", "targetDescription": "Prime minister acknowledges \u2018divisive\u2019 effect of Brexit vote with pledge to seek beneficial relationship with EU"}

The resulting controversy, still smoldering today, seemed irresolvable: Depending on whom you asked, the hunt was either sadistic blood sport or noble tradition. Two sociologists, Dave Harker and Diane C. Bates, scrutinized 10 years of clashing regional newspaper editorials and letters to the editor and concluded that the two sides did not even seem to be arguing about the same animal. Actual bears had been replaced by \u201ccompeting social constructions\u201d of bears. Those in favor of the hunt imagined the animals as \u201cmenacing threats\u201d that needed to be controlled; those against saw them as docile and benevolent creatures that just wanted to \u201clive in peace.\u201d", "Each construction of the bear was then girded by the construction of subsequent constructions; the meaning-making escalated quickly. Voices opposing the hunt dismissed hunters as \u201cuncivilized killers incapable of reason and unworthy of respect,\u201d while hunters dismissed opponents as \u201cpanicky\u201d suburbanites and \u201canthro-antagonistic wackos of the PETA-Qaeda cult.\u201d With each side delegitimizing the other, actual dialogue seemed impossible. And everyone delegitimized the government, with each side believing that the state couldn\u2019t be trusted to make a fair decision about the hunt because it was corrupted by the other. The entire episode, the sociologists wrote, \u201chighlights how public discourse has fed intractability over the conflict rather than provided common grounds for consensus.\u201d Bears are huge, immovable objects, made of bone and meat. And yet here they were, being swished around like ephemeral sock puppets on a plane of pure, post-truth subjectivity called New Jersey.", "So that was the backdrop. Now enter Pedals, shambling on two legs.", "The black bear rose to fame in the summer of 2014, after a man in suburban Oak Ridge filmed him toddling through the bulb end of a quiet cul-de-sac at dawn. Pedals, as he became known, appeared to be missing his right front paw, and his left front leg seemed warped and truncated \u2014 injury or deformity, only he knew. But he had apparently compensated for these disabilities by learning to walk upright, an image that produced both delight and terror. It all felt deeply weird. Especially because Pedals was good at walking. The camera tracked him as he moved in a sturdy lurch, covering a lot of ground, holding his dangling, unnecessary arms close to his chest like a mime absconding with a snatched purse. At one point, Pedals leaned over a garbage can, just to check out what was inside. Then he crossed a lawn and accelerated into a stand of trees. It was obvious where he was heading: internet fame.", "At first, many people refused to believe that the footage was real. But even those who did resorted to describing Pedals as looking like a human in a bear suit \u2014 which, on the skeletal level, is a fair description of what all bears are. His humanness was uncanny and made our animal-ness feel suddenly uncanny, too. After all, we were quadrupedal ourselves until three to six million years ago, when a few of us reared up and decided to stop moving dumbly in the direction of our digestive tracts. It was our earliest signature innovation. Now Pedals was innovating, too \u2014 crossing some sacrosanct threshold of verticality, blurring some line. They didn\u2019t contextualize the video like this when they played it on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d but if the walking bear unsettled you, I\u2019m suggesting that this is why.", "More people saw Pedals. More videos surfaced. The question became: What should we do about him? Two local women, Sabrina Walsh Pugsley and Lisa Rose-Rublack, started an online petition asking the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to capture the bear and transport him to an orphaned wildlife center in upstate New York. By 2015, they had wrangled about 300,000 signatures from around the world, and they ultimately raised almost $25,000 to pay for the relocation. They ceremoniously delivered the petition to the State House and staged a small protest outside. Rose-Rublack worked in the world of domestic animal rescue \u2014 saving dogs, saving cats. It seemed obvious to her that a crippled black bear warranted the same compassionate intervention. There were reports of Pedals looking exhausted or frail. \u201cWe just wanted to take care of him,\u201d Rose-Rublack says.", "State wildlife officials saw things differently. \u201cThe bipedal bear,\u201d as they insisted on calling him, was not a victim but a survivor. Pedals was getting around, foraging, denning in winter \u2014 successfully executing all vital bear behaviors. They were hesitant to wrench an animal from the wild unnecessarily and warned that what might, through a certain anthropomorphic lens, feel like rescuing could actually be imprisonment. One wildlife expert, unaffiliated with the state but frequently called on by the press \u2014 a Pedals pundit \u2014 summed up the situation nicely: \u201cWe process things differently in the wildlife community,\u201d she explained. She and her colleagues were looking at the exact same bear, feeling the exact same compassion. But, she said, they drew a different conclusion: \u201cWe don\u2019t think he needs saving.\u201d", "Every new Pedals sighting suggested that the state\u2019s worldview best reflected the objective reality: He survived two winters; he was muddling through. When new footage of him appeared this June, wildlife officials noted that he even seemed to have put on some weight; they described him as \u201cthriving.\u201d But the wild card all along, of course, was New Jersey\u2019s bear hunt. And on Oct. 10, it happened: A bow hunter in Morris County lugged Pedals\u2019s body to a check station and weighed him in at 334 pounds. (Or what appeared to be Pedals\u2019s body; the state won\u2019t definitively identify any wild animal unless it has been tagged.)", "One photograph, released by the government, shows Pedals hanging from a scale with a bloodied maw \u2014 vertical again, but this time upside down. The Department of Environmental Protection would not release the hunter\u2019s identity. (When rumors swirled around one man, he says he received death threats.) And so it was impossible to know the circumstances: whether the hunter knew the bear\u2019s identity before he or she fired; whether Pedals, who did spend some time on all fours, had been distinguishable from an ordinary bear; whether he had been standing upright in the wilderness, looking preposterous and conspicuous, and conspicuously like himself. That is, the bear\u2019s posture \u2014 the very proof of his resilience \u2014 might have marked him for death.", "It was never clear what we owed Pedals, exactly. You could argue that allowing Pedals to live in the woods and be hunted, like any other bear, was an act of respect \u2014 a validation of his wildness. You could also argue that it was a gruesome lapse of human compassion.", "Pedals stood for something. We may never agree what it was.", "Jon Mooallem is a writer at large for the magazine and the author of \u201cWild Ones.\u201d", "B. 1938", "What you learn when you ride shotgun with the former attorney general.", "Central Florida is the in-between you make go away by pressing a little harder on the gas.

Daddy, why are you doing this?\u201d Corley\u2019s wife of 12 years can also be heard in the background: \u201cChris, please stop.\u201d That prompted the dispatcher to call Aiken County 911. \u201cI had a caller, sounded a lot like children screaming for help and begging for their father to stop,\u201d the operator said. In a later 911 call, a woman identified by the sheriff\u2019s office as Corley\u2019s mother-in-law asks for deputies to be sent to the home of a man threatening to kill himself. The dispatcher says deputies are already on the way for \u201csome type of disturbance where the father is beating children?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d she responds. \u201cHe beat his wife and he\u2019s threatening to kill himself.\u201d That corresponds with the police report released Tuesday, which said Corley\u2019s wife took the family to her mother\u2019s house across the street after he threatened to kill her, then said he would kill himself. The report said she ran with the children when he went to the bedroom.\u00a0", "Deputies can be seen in a dash cam video driving to the home where the incident occurred, CBS Charleston affiliate WCSCreported.

He\u2019s also barred from handling a firearm.\u00a0", "House Speaker Jay Lucas has promised to take action if Corley is indicted. By state law, Corley must be suspended from the House if indicted on a felony charge. The 36-year-old Republican was easily re-elected to a second term last month with no opposition. Corley\u2019s arrest comes after a legislative session where lawmakers strengthened punishments for domestic violence. Gov. Nikki Haley made it a priority to reduce the state\u2019s high rate of women killed by men who know them. Corley voted for the legislation. Corley may be best known in the House as a staunch defender of the Confederate flag. In 2015, he sent a Christmas card that featured a photo of the Confederate flag that was removed this year from the Statehouse to his Republican colleagues, suggesting they use the holiday to \u201cask for forgiveness of all your sins such as betrayal.\u201d", "During the debate last year on whether to remove the Confederate flag from Statehouse grounds, Corley suggested replacing it with the white flag of surrender and held up a piece of paper taped to a pencil to illustrate his point. The debate followed the massacre of nine black parishioners in a Charleston church by a white man seen in photos brandishing the rebel banner. After the flag was removed in July 2015, he sponsored a bill calling for a statewide vote on whether to return the flag to a pole in front of the Statehouse. The bill went nowhere.\u00a0"], "targetTitle": "\"Just stop daddy\" children scream in 911 call from lawmaker's home", "postTimestamp": "Sat Dec 31 01:33:55 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "south carolina, domestic abuse, Chris Corley, 9/11, aiken, aiken county, 911 Call, domestic violence", "targetDescription": "Children can be heard screaming \u201cjust stop daddy\u201d on a 911 call made from the home of South Carolina legislator Chris Corley"}

But even as President Vladimir Putin trolls the White House, saying he will turn the other cheek and sit tight awaiting what figures to be a more friendly administration on the horizon, questions outpace answers.", "So what comes next and who holds the advantage? Here's what we know, what the players are saying -- and how the chess match is unfolding.", "What did the US do on Thursday and why?", "After weeks of ramped-up accusations about Russian hacking and promises of retaliation, the White House announced plans to expel 35 Russian diplomats -- giving them and their families 72 hours to leave the country -- and shuttering a pair of Russian compounds in New York and Maryland used by officials, in theory, for recreational purposes.", "The new sanctions follow months of insinuations, leaks and, more recently, open accusations that Moscow set out on a coordinated campaign to hack the private communications of American political actors, making public information that would both undermine voters' confidence in the November elections and, according to some, boost Trump's campaign.", "In a \"joint analysis report\" by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, released with the sanctions notice on Thursday a summary titled \"Russian Malicious Cyber Activity\" and provided a detailed flowchart seeking to illustrate the complex nature of the Russian hacking effort.", "How did Putin respond to the new sanctions?", "The Russian President's decision to postpone any retaliation for Washington's sanctions, despite Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recommending the tit-for-tat expulsion of US diplomats, surprised some Kremlin-watchers.", "In retrospect, Moscow's tactics appeared orchestrated: first threatening to match the explosions announced by the Obama administration the previous day, then, in seeking to appear magnanimous -- even extending an invitation to the children of American diplomats in Washington to a Christmas party at the Kremlin -- backing off.", "At the same time, Putin laid the onus of action on incoming President Donald Trump.", "\"It's a smart play,\" said James Nixie, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the London-based think-tank Chatham House. He said that while \"Russia feels humiliated -- it has been exposed and it has been punished,\" Putin can afford to wait a few weeks to hit back. \"He's thought about it, considered acting now, but in fact is just being patient,\" Nixie said.", "Putin's decision will force Trump to show his hand -- and fast.", "\"If Trump doesn't play ball, then we'll be back to the old-style adversarial relations,\" Nixie said. Putin is waiting to see \"is Trump on our side, or is he not? At this point, we don't know, either.\"", "On Friday afternoon, the President-elect offered some blunt instruction.", "\"Great move on delay (by V. Putin),\" he tweeted. \"I always knew he was very smart!\"", "Is this the start of a new Cold War?", "While there are echoes of the Cold War in the matching expulsion threats, Nixie argued that Russia's actions are predominantly about its future, not its past: Moscow \"wants a new set of rules\" to govern the way the world is run -- who wields the power, who controls what, and who listens to whom.", "Putin's move can also be read as an \"enormous insult\" to the Obama administration, said Jill Dougherty, a Russia analyst and former Moscow bureau chief for CNN.", "\"It's an amazing move and it's classic Putin,\" she said. \"He's a master of doing things that are unexpected, and this is truly unexpected.\"", "How strong is the US case against Russia?", "That depends on whom you ask.", "Trump has for months routinely questioned government assertions that state-sponsored Russian hackers were behind the breaches at the Democratic National Committee and inside Clinton's campaign. He has suggested the Chinese could be to blame, or even \"somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\"", "But the US government has been laser-focused on Moscow for months. In October, officials publicly announced they were \"confident\" Russia had targeted the Democratic Party and aligned organizations. Obama this summer allowed, but stopped short of asserting in an interview that Putin had intended to aid Trump.", "How the unflattering communications put on display by the hacks affected the election is nearly impossible to quantify, but the slow drip seemed calculated to sow discord and doubt, especially among Democrats during and after a tense primary contest.", "Trump now says he'll meet with the intelligence community to hear their case.", "Why did the White House act now?", "The ultimate decision followed a CIA announcement this month, made in private to a group of top US senators, that the hacks were carried out with the express purpose of delivering the White House to Trump.", "Their evidence -- which, again, has not been made public except through leaks to the press -- includes findings that Russian hackers breached, but did not make public information stolen from the accounts of Republicans, including House members and GOP non-profits, according to a former senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the hack investigation told CNN.", "The Republican National Committee has denied reports that it was compromised or targeted, and earlier this month, Trump's incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, questioned the intelligence community's motives.", "\"If they are so certain it happened, why won't they go on the record and say it?\" Spicer told CNN. \"I don't understand it. It doesn't make any sense.\"", "What is Obama's angle here?", "The Russians tend to get the credit -- and criticism -- for being crafty or acting covertly to advance a range of interests. On its face, the new round of sanctions are a simple act of retaliation -- less a deft or devious hand than a symbolic swat -- for the Kremlin's alleged role in the election season hacks.", "But whether it was intended or not, the Obama administration's decision to act now, less than a month before clearing out ahead of Trump's inaugural, will have a series of knock-on effects that should create difficulties and set a series of political traps for the new administration.", "Trump has made no secret of his hopes to establish better relations with Putin and his autocratic regime. He played down news of the sanctions on Thursday, saying it was \"time for the country to move on to bigger and better things.\" A day earlier, the President-elect seemed to throw up his hands entirely, pleading ignorance -- and skepticism -- of all things tech.", "\"The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on,\" he said. \"And we have speed -- we have a lot of other things, but I'm not sure we have the kind the security we need.\"", "Trump will need a more comprehensive argument, and understanding, if he is going to successfully navigate a Congress almost uniformly in favor of maintaining or, in the case of hawks like Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain, pursuing further avenues of redress.", "If Obama, his legislative legacy under threat from all corners, can effectively tie up the new administration and members of its own party -- to say nothing of Democrats who will gladly align themselves with more mainstream Republicans -- then he stands a better chance of at least complicating Trump's efforts to undo the work of the past eight years.", "What is Trump's play now?", "Trump, who has repeatedly said he just wants everyone to move on, can undo the Thursday sanctions with relative ease after he takes office on January 20. But a unilateral decision to reverse course could expose divisions in a GOP caucus that, for all its post-election talk of unity, remains fundamentally divided on key issues like spending and what to do after it repeals Obamacare.", "The confluence of Obama's action and Putin's demurral will test Trump right from the jump, as moving for steadier relations with Moscow will now come at a heightened domestic cost. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Russia critic, will likely seek to influence Trump, further stressing their already fragile relationship and challenging incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has emerged as a trusted middleman between his idiosyncratic boss and the established GOP order.", "While the GOP establishment has stayed critical of Russia, Trump sees it differently. He is also threatened by his unique handicap -- an apparent inability to, at least publicly, conceive of the hacking story as anything more or less than a backdoor assault on the legitimacy of his victory on Election Day.", "\"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?\" he asked in a tweet last week, before the sanctions had been finalized. \"Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\"", "The claim was demonstrably false -- the grousing had begun well before November 8 -- but made clear how Trump perceives the question. In his Thursday statement, the President-elect was more reserved and revealed he would, \"in the interest of our country and its great people,\" take a meeting with \"leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\"", "How Trump responds to those facts, and whether he accepts them at all, will go a long way in articulating the paths ahead.

The Eyes of My Mother", "Magnet Releasing", "Director: Nicolas Pesce Writer: Nicolas Pesce It\u2019s a blessing that The Eyes of My Mother is in black and white, because rendered in full color, its garish display of violence would be nearly impossible to endure. But as it stands, it\u2019s all kind of beautiful in a stomach-turning sort of way. When her mother (Diana Agostini) is murdered, young Francisca\u2019s (played by Olivia Bond as a child) precocious fixation on dissection and surgery turns into a dark obsession. By the time she reaches adulthood, Francisca (played by Kika Magalhaes as an adult) has let her urges fester and blossom into full-blown psychotic behavior. There is a method to Francisca\u2019s madness, but The Eyes of My Mother isn\u2019t all that interested in arriving at a satisfying conclusion. It\u2019s more of an exploration of themes, an art house indie with plenty of eyeball removal. And frankly, it\u2019s the allure of its stylistic gore that makes it worth wading through.", "18. You\u2019re Killing Me", "Wolfe Video", "Director: Jim Hansen Writers: Jim Hansen and Jeffery Self In most cases, \u201cyou\u2019re killing me\u201d is just a euphemism for \u201cyou\u2019re fucking hilarious.\u201d That\u2019s what makes the title of this horror-comedy so apt: It\u2019s a slasher where the victims are so ironically detached that they can\u2019t seem to realize an actual serial killer is picking them off one by one. The audience knows that Joe (Matthew McKelligon) is being completely serious when he confesses to murder after murder long before his new boyfriend George (Jeffery Self) even notices anything is wrong, which makes for good comedy, of course. But You\u2019re Killing Me is also a darkly satirical skewering of self-involvement and insincerity, two qualities shared by every one of its characters except for the psychopath.", "17. Carnage Park", "IFC Midnight", "Director: Mickey Keating Writer: Mickey Keating Carnage Park begins as a fairly straightforward crime thriller: Vivian (Ashley Bell) finds herself taken hostage by two thieves on the run. Following some surprise intervention by a sniper \u2014 later revealed to be the gleefully homicidal Wyatt Moss (Pat Healy) \u2014 Vivian realizes she\u2019s in a much more dire predicament, and the film slides into blood-splattered horror territory. Up-and-coming auteur Mickey Keating (who made last year\u2019s list with Pod) is adept at genre-shifting, and his affection for pulling the rug out from under his audience keeps his films feeling fresh. On paper, Carnage Park \u2014 ultimately a cat-and-mouse game between a killer and his would-be victim \u2014 might sound familiar, but everything about the way it plays out is bold and distinctive. Keating, like his characters, remains hard to pin down.", "16. Shelley", "Profile Pictures", "Director: Ali Abbasi Writers: Ali Abbasi and Maren Louise K\u00e4ehne Pregnancy is a subject horror returns to frequently, and with good reason \u2014 there\u2019s something inherently terrifying about having another human being growing inside you. Shelley, from first-time Danish filmmaker Ali Abbasi, hits some familiar tropes in its exploration of the paranoid anxiety of pregnancy. Childless couple Louise (Ellen Dorrit Petersen) and Kasper (Peter Christoffersen) seem to have the best intentions when they ask their Romanian housekeeper Elena (Cosmina Stratan) to be their surrogate in exchange for the money she needs to return home, but there\u2019s an ominous undercurrent to the exchange. That only builds after Elena conceives and begins to display the body horror symptoms of a parasitic infection. Shelley offers few concrete answers when it comes to the root of the apparent possession, but its nasty conclusion is well-earned.", "15. Don\u2019t Breathe", "Screen Gems", "Director: Fede Alvarez Writers: Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues Part of what makes Don\u2019t Breathe such a successful modern mainstream horror film \u2014 of which there are few \u2014 is the way it subverts some of the more popular tropes. Unlike in standard home invasion thrillers (think The Strangers or The Purge), the protagonists are the ones who do the home invading. When Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette), and Money (Daniel Zovatto) break into the home of a blind man (Stephen Lang), they expect an easy heist. Instead, they discover that the man is not only far from helpless, but also completely deranged. He is another clever twist on the link between disability and victimhood \u2014 Hush, which also came out this year, does similar work with a deaf Final Girl. But the real measure of Don\u2019t Breathe\u2019s effectiveness is how unbearably tense it is. Fede Alvarez is a modern-day master of suspense.", "14. The Wailing", "20th Century Fox Korea", "Director: Na Hong-jin Writer: Na Hong-jin The Wailing is a strange, sprawling two-and-a-half-hour epic about a police officer, Jong-goo (Kwak Do-won), investigating a series of odd illnesses and deaths while trying to save his daughter, Hyo-jin (Kim Hwan-hee), from suffering a similar fate. The plot isn\u2019t hard to follow \u2014 there\u2019s a suspicious old man, a mysterious young woman, a shaman with questionable motives \u2014 but it borders on exhausting. That could easily be a mark against The Wailing, but this is the kind of film that works best when you give yourself over to it entirely. It\u2019s that omnipresent chaos and uncertainty that ultimately makes The Wailing such a memorable horror film. Every step (or misstep) Jong-goo makes leads him further down the rabbit hole, and we\u2019re along for the ride.", "13. Southbound", "The Orchard", "Directors: Radio Silence, Roxanne Benjamin, David Bruckner, and Patrick Horvath Writers: Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Roxanne Benjamin, Susan Burke, David Bruckner, Patrick Horvath, and Dallas Hallam It feels a little unfair to call Southbound an anthology film. Yes, it\u2019s essentially a series of short films with a wraparound story, each with its own set of writers and directors, but these tales are far more intertwined than that genre designation would suggest. (Contrast it, for example, with the V/H/S series, where the only link between the short films is that they\u2019re found footage.) Southbound\u2019s shared universe \u2014 each story begins as another ends \u2014 is what elevates it past the individual chapters, which are creepy but somewhat open-ended. Taken as a whole, the film builds on a powerful sense of dread, which is underlined by a final sequence that makes Southbound\u2019s narrative conceit clear. These characters are doomed, bound in an endless cycle of guilt and violent retribution, and that sense of futility and uneasy d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is scarier than any of its separate stories.", "12. Always Shine", "Oscilloscope Laboratories", "Director: Sophia Takal Writer: Lawrence Michael Levine Those who fell in love with Mackenzie Davis\u2019s nerdy charm in the \u201cSan Junipero\u201d episode of Black Mirror will be taken aback by her thrillingly unhinged performance in Always Shine. Her transformation from meek and put-upon to dominant and sexually aggressive is central to this psychological thriller about fractured identity. It all plays out in the not-so-friendly competition between two aspiring actors, Davis\u2019s Anna and her more successful best friend, Beth (Caitlin FitzGerald). Always Shine shares some fairly obvious DNA with Single White Female and Mulholland Drive, but it stands on its own thanks to Sophia Takal\u2019s confident direction and the strength of its two leads, whose rivalry seamlessly transitions from merely uncomfortable to life-and-death. Their showdown is one of the scariest moments committed to film this year.", "11. They Look Like People", "Perry Blackshear", "Director: Perry Blackshear Writer: Perry Blackshear The question at the center of They Look Like People is simple: Is Wyatt (MacLeod Andrews) losing his mind, or is everyone around him really turning into an evil creature bent on humanity\u2019s destruction? But the answer isn\u2019t really evasive, and beyond it lurks a more pressing question: Can Wyatt\u2019s old friend Christian (Evan Dumouchel) save him from himself? It\u2019s fascinating to watch this film shift from the standard paranoid horror of Invasion of the Body Snatchers \u2014 everyone is a pod person! \u2014 to the more grounded, relatable horror of a troubled man losing touch with reality. The climax, in which Wyatt wrestles with his demons while Christian\u2019s life hangs in the balance, is nearly unbearable. Without giving too much away, the monster in his own head proves way more frightening than any outside threats.", "10. Pet", "Magic Lantern", "Director: Carles Torrens Writer: Jeremy Slater It\u2019s hard to talk about Pet without talking about the major twist that completely undermines everything that came before it. It\u2019s a brilliant conceit that transforms the movie you thought you were watching into something else entirely. Dominic Monaghan stars as Seth, a troubled loner who appears dangerously obsessed with a beautiful stranger named Holly (Ksenia Solo). Once he locks her up in a cage, you think you know how things are going to play out, which makes the gut-punch of what\u2019s really going on hit you that much harder. Even before that, the dynamic between Monaghan and Solo makes for compelling viewing. Pet might be a tough sell to anyone who is tired of horror films about creepy men exerting control over innocent women. But if you stick with it, you\u2019ll find a far more complex and rewarding narrative.", "9. Train to Busan", "Next Entertainment World", "Director: Yeon Sang-ho Writer: Park Joo-suk Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) is an absentee father whose plans to take his daughter, Soo-an (Kim Soo-an), to visit her mother are derailed when their titular train is overrun by zombies. No, we don\u2019t really need another zombie movie, but if more within the genre were as deft as Train to Busan, there\u2019d be no cause for complaints. The film does so much of what The Walking Dead wishes it could, balancing subtle character drama with bloody, zombie-heavy set pieces that propel the action along. It\u2019s daring when it needs to be and somber when the moment calls for it; never does Train to Busan forget that at its center is the story of a father struggling to connect with his daughter (and, you know, protect her from hordes of the undead).", "8. Under the Shadow", "Netflix", "Director: Babak Anvari Writer: Babak Anvari Much like in The Babadook, the fractured relationship between a mother and a child is closely aligned with a demonic presence in Under the Shadow. In the war-torn Tehran of the \u201980s, Shideh (Narges Rashidi) is coming to terms with her thwarted medical ambitions while trying to understand the strange behavior of her daughter, Dorsa (Avin Manshadi). Under the Shadow offers a pointed look at the role of women in post-revolutionary Iran, and Shideh is an engaging, fully realized character at the heart of the story. It is also, again like The Babadook, thoroughly terrifying. The entity antagonizing the family here \u2014 which is identified as a Djinn, fitting with the setting \u2014 offers plenty of scares throughout. That\u2019s extra impressive given that Shideh and Dorsa are also seeking shelter from falling bombs, a more realistic and understandable fear.", "7. 10 Cloverfield Lane", "Paramount Pictures", "Director: Dan Trachtenberg Writers: Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken, Damien Chazelle Yes, there is some sort of thematic link between this film and the 2008 movie Cloverfield. But even if 10 Cloverfield Lane is a spiritual sequel (whatever that means), it\u2019s more of a restrained, claustrophobic horror film than the city-destroying chaos of the earlier movie. After getting in a car accident, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up and discovers that she\u2019s being kept prisoner alongside Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). Their captor, Howard (John Goodman), claims he\u2019s just trying to protect them from the toxic air outside, the result of a chemical attack. But the longer Michelle is forced to stay put, the more she doubts Howard\u2019s story. Goodman is the standout here, creating an imposing but still ambiguous villain.", "6. The Monster", "A24", "Director: Bryan Bertino Writer: Bryan Bertino The Monster has some surface-level similarities to The Babadook (and Under the Shadow, also on this list) in that it\u2019s also about a mother and child fighting back against an evil outside force while trying to work through their own fraught relationship. But what distinguishes The Monster, among other things, is that calling the relationship between Kathy (Zoe Kazan) and her daughter, Lizzy (Ella Ballentine), \u201cfraught\u201d is a tremendous understatement. Kathy is a troubled addict who has little interest in her kid; in a flashback, she strikes Lizzy for apparently hiding her drugs. That makes for an even more interesting albeit painful dynamic when the two join forces against the beast that attacks their car late at night. Kathy\u2019s desire to protect her daughter does not excuse her past misdeeds, but it does make for compelling viewing.", "5. Green Room", "A24", "Director: Jeremy Saulnier Writer: Jeremy Saulnier Not everyone considers Green Room to be a horror film, but Jeremy Saulnier\u2019s endlessly entertaining thriller feels tense, confined, and blood-splattered enough to qualify for inclusion here. Punk band the Ain\u2019t Rights \u2014 Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece (Joe Cole), and Tiger (Callum Turner) \u2014 are in the wrong place at the wrong time when they witness the aftermath of a murder at a neo-Nazi club they\u2019ve been inadvertently booked at. Trapped in the green room of the title, the band members have to figure out how to escape without getting hacked to death by a machete or shot in the head. It probably goes without saying that their exit route is not without bumps. What makes Green Room impressive is how it keeps its cool and sense of humor alongside some shocking bursts of violence. At times, it walks the line of horror-comedy.", "4. The Shallows", "Columbia Pictures", "Director: Jaume Collet-Serra Writer: Anthony Jaswinski If the premise \u201cBlake Lively versus a shark\u201d doesn\u2019t get you excited, The Shallows may not be the movie for you. Yes, there\u2019s some backstory, and a few other characters who appear briefly for the sole purpose of becoming shark chum, but the majority of The Shallows is Lively\u2019s Nancy, stranded on a rock in the middle of the water following a shark attack, trying to figure out how to stop herself from bleeding to death and return safely to shore. It feels silly to call The Shallows restrained \u2014 and if you\u2019ve witnessed the over-the-top showdown in its conclusion, you understand why. But it is sharply focused, and that\u2019s what makes it such a pleasure from start to finish: It\u2019s Nancy, her shark adversary, and the occasional appearance of a bird named Steven Seagull. Not to mention a whole lot of will-she-make-it stress.", "3. The Witch", "A24", "Director: Robert Eggers Writer: Robert Eggers The mystery of The Witch could easily have been Is the witch real, or is she just the product of puritanical fears and anxiety about the unknown? But the film shows its hand early on by revealing that it\u2019s the former: The first thing the witch (Bathsheba Garnett) does is murder a baby, so it\u2019s clear the threat is very real. But for the family at the center of The Witch, the danger seems to be coming from inside. Oldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) is soon questioned for her apparent link to dark forces. It\u2019s rare for a horror film to explore this time period, and to blend the larger thematic fears of the time with a more literal manifestation. Taylor-Joy gives an excellent performance as a young woman unfairly targeted by superstition, while also reckoning with the destructive power of a real supernatural force.", "2. The Invitation", "Drafthouse Films", "Director: Karyn Kusama Writer: Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi Los Angeles will latch on to any new fad, whether that means a new form of yoga, some kind of smoothie infusion, or the latest death cult. At least, that\u2019s the impression Will (Logan Marshall-Green) gets when he attends a dinner party hosted by his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard), and her new husband, David (Michiel Huisman). Whether Will\u2019s fears are rational or completely off the wall, there\u2019s something undeniably off about the gathering from the get-go. Karyn Kusama does an excellent job of ratcheting up the tension, creating the impression that very bad things are happening even when all the audience sees is a group of people sitting around a table and chatting. When The Invitation does take a turn, thoroughly embracing its horror identity, it\u2019s the natural progression of an hour of escalation. The frenzied climax ends up feeling like a necessary release.", "1. Krisha", "A24", "Director: Trey Edward Shults Writer: Trey Edward Shults Yes, really. Krisha is a family drama, but it\u2019s also a stunning psychological horror film. On paper, it might not look that way. The eponymous Krisha (Krisha Fairchild) is a sixtysomething drug addict who tentatively tries to reconnect with her family at Thanksgiving \u2014 and then relapses. Hard. It\u2019s the kind of subject matter that could, in theory, end up on Lifetime. Instead, Trey Edward Shults opted to shoot and edit his film like a monster movie. Even the score is pure horror. There isn\u2019t an actual monster here, although you could make a case for either Krisha or her crippling addiction, both of which lurk in the shadows (Krisha quite literally) until they burst forth and terrorize everyone in their wake. There were scarier movies than Krisha this year, but when it comes to horror in its most basic terms, Krisha can\u2019t be beat.", "\u00a9 2017 BuzzFeed, Inc"], "targetTitle": "The 19 Best Horror Films Of\u00a02016 For more Best of 2016 content, click here!", "postTimestamp": "Fri Dec 30 05:31:02 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "", "targetDescription": ""}

Inside, it's a whole different story. A different reality, in fact. Humanoid robots walk down the halls, and green reptilian monsters hang out in the lounge. Cartoon fairies turn the lights on and off. War machines, 75 feet tall, patrol the parking lot.", "Even the office equipment does the impossible. The high-definition television hanging on the wall seems perfectly normal. Until it vanishes. A moment later it reappears in the middle of the room. Incredibly, it is now levitating in midair. Get as close as you'd like, check it out from different angles. It's 80 inches diagonal, tuned to ESPN--and there is nothing holding it up.", "The TV looks real, but it is not. All these wonders are illusions, conjured into being through the lenses of a mixed reality headset--the arcane invention of the startup called Magic Leap.", "Like any good magician, founder and CEO Rony Abovitz, 45, keeps his cards close to his chest. Magic Leap has operated in extreme secrecy since it was founded in 2011. Only a few people got to see its technology, even fewer knew how it worked, and all of them were buried under so many nondisclosure agreements that they could barely admit the company existed.", "Yet massive amounts of money were flowing down to Dania Beach, Florida, a town of 30,000 just south of Fort Lauderdale. To date, Magic Leap has raised nearly $1.4 billion in venture capital, including $794 million this past February, reportedly the largest C round in history. Seemingly every blue-chip tech investor has a chunk, including Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Google, JPMorgan, Fidelity and Alibaba, plus there's backing from less conventional sources such as Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment, the maker of films like Godzilla and Jurassic World. Magic Leap was valued at $4.5 billion in its latest round of financing. If Abovitz has held on to just 22% of the company--which he denies-- he's a billionaire.", "That cascade of money sparked strange rumors within tech circles: Magic Leap was doing something with holograms, or with lasers, or had invented some reality-warping machine the size of a building that would never, could never, be commercialized. The lack of hard information further fueled the whispers. Magic Leap, after all, has never released a product. It has never given a public demonstration of a product, never announced a product, never explained the proprietary lightfield technology that powers its product.", "But now the company is coming out of the shadows. In a rare interview Abovitz says Magic Leap has spent a billion dollars perfecting a prototype and has begun constructing manufacturing lines in Florida, ahead of a release of a consumer version of its technology. When it arrives--best guess is within the next 18 months--it could usher in a new era of computing, a next-generation interface we'll use for decades to come. We are building a new kind of contextual computer, Abovitz says. We're doing something really, really different.", "Magic Leap's innovation isn't just a high-tech display--it's a disruption machine. This technology could affect every business that uses screens or computers and many that don't. It could kill the $120 billion market for flat-panel displays and shake the $1 trillion global consumer-electronics business to its core. The applications are profound. Throw out your PC, your laptop and your mobile phone, because the computing power you need will be in your glasses, and they can make a display appear anywhere, at any size you like.", "For that matter, they can make anything appear, like directions to your next meeting, drawn in bright yellow arrows along the roads of your town. You'll be able to see what that new couch you're thinking of buying looks like in your living room, from every conceivable angle, under every lighting condition, without leaving your home. Even the least mechanically inclined will be able to repair their automobiles, with an interactive program highlighting exactly which part needs to be replaced and alerting you if you're doing it wrong. And Magic Leap is positioned to profit from every interaction: not just from the hardware and software it will sell but also, one imagines, from the torrent of data it could collect, analyze--and resell.", "It's hard to think of an area that doesn't completely change, Abovitz says.", "YOU HAVE LIKELY TRIED virtual reality--Sony, Google, Samsung and Facebook have all debuted VR products in the past 12 months. VR is an immersive computer-generated simulation, now used mostly for videogames, whereby VR headsets mask and replace the real world.", "You may have also tried augmented reality, in which digital content is overlaid on a physical environment. One of the biggest digital fads of 2016 made AR mainstream: In July mobile app developer Niantic released Pok&eacute;mon Go, a game that uses smartphone cameras to make animated monsters appear to exist in the real world--or at least on your phone's screen.", "Neither a VR game nor Pok&eacute;mon Go can do what Magic Leap's mixed reality does. VR takes you to another place. AR can make a Pikachu appear in your living room. Mixed reality keeps you where you are--and makes that Pikachu come to life.", "How does it do it? The centerpiece of Magic Leap's technology is a head-mounted display, but the final product should fit into a pair of spectacles. When you're wearing the device, it doesn't block your view of the world; the hardware projects an image directly onto your retina through an optics system built into a piece of semitransparent glass (the product won't fry your eyeballs; it's replicating the way we naturally observe the world instead of forcing you to stare at a screen). The hardware also constantly gathers information, scanning the room for obstacles, listening for voices, tracking eye movements and watching hands.", "As a result, mixed-reality objects are aware of their environment and have the ability to interact with the real world. On Magic Leap's hardware a Pok&eacute;mon might escape capture by ducking behind your couch or, assuming you live in a smart home, turning off your lights and hiding in the dark.", "In one of its demos the Magic Leap team shows off a computer-generated virtual interactive human, life-size and surprisingly realistic. Abovitz and his team imagine virtual people (or animals or anything else) as digital assistants--think Siri on steroids, except with a physical presence that makes her easier to work with and harder to ignore. Ask your virtual assistant to deliver a message to a coworker and it might walk out of your office, reappear beside your colleague's desk via his or her own MR headset and deliver the message in person.", "In a mixed reality world, computing power isn't confined to a gadget on your desk. It's something that you can link to any object, real or virtual, giving it awareness of its location, intelligence about its purpose and insight on how you might want to use it. Think of it as the future state of computing, Abovitz says, where the world is your desktop. First we had mainframes, then PCs, then mobile devices. If Magic Leap has its way, the next generation will be virtual.", "This is not about entertainment or just playing videogames, says Thomas Tull, the billionaire founder of Legendary Entertainment. This is a different way of interacting with the world, a new generation of computers. I think this will end up being a very, very important company.", " Email of the future? A virtual desktop, atop an actual desktop, conveyed through Magic Leap's prototype headset.", "RONY ABOVITZ HAS always surrounded himself with visions of a high-tech future. Born in 1971 to Israeli immigrants living in Cleveland, he grew up fascinated with computers and science fiction. My generation are the children of Steve Jobs and George Lucas, he says. We grew up on that, and our brains all got scrambled. . . . My friends and I all wanted to be Luke Skywalker and defeat the Death Star and build C-3PO.", "When he was 11, the family moved to South Florida; he started high school at 13, a year early. After graduation he was accepted at MIT but chose the University of Miami, staying close to home. He received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1994 and a master's in biomedical engineering two years later--and then he started thinking about Star Wars again.", "Abovitz cofounded his first company, Z-KAT, in 1997. I decided to build the medical droid from Star Wars because I thought--I mean, this was the genuine impulse--I couldn't build an X-wing fighter, because that wasn't something I could explain to my parents after graduating, he says. In 2004 Abovitz and several of his cofounders spun out Z-KAT's robotics group into a new company, Mako Surgical, that made robotic arms to assist doctors in orthopedic surgeries. Demand for the droids was high, and in 2008 the company went public, raising $51 million.", "Working full-time at Mako and married with a young daughter, Abovitz found an outlet for his creative side in a project he called Hour Blue--his own fictional fantasy world, an alien planet full of fantastic creatures like talking robots and flying whales. In 2010 he started a new company, Magic Leap Studios, to develop the project as a graphic novel series and a feature film franchise.", "I was the only employee, and it was literally in my garage, Abovitz says. My mom made a piece of canvas with some colored letters on it that said, 'Magic Leap Studios.'  For help on the project, he used some of the cash he'd banked from Mako to hire Weta Workshop, the New Zealand-based special effects and creative-development shop best known for its work on The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, to develop imagery based on his story ideas and flesh out the world. Meanwhile, inspired by sci-fi novels like William Gibson's Neuromancer and Vernor Vinge's Rainbows End, Abovitz became frustrated that the augmented and virtual reality he'd read about in fiction wasn't available in the real world and began thinking about how to make it so.", "It was a unique moment. ... Reality and science fiction began to merge, says Richard Taylor, CEO of Weta Workshop and a member of Magic Leap's board. The fictitious technologies that we were creating for Hour Blue were developing in parallel to the real-world applications of augmented technology that Rony was beginning to explore.", "In 2011 Magic Leap Studios changed focus and became Magic Leap Inc., with Abovitz hiring a small team to help him develop this idea of mixed reality. Before long the company had working prototypes.", "The first time we had a single pixel in space, where we could move it around the room, we were so excited, Abovitz says. Other people were like, 'What is that? That's just a dot.' But we knew. I knew at that point this was going to work.", "He also knew he was going to need a lot more money. Abovitz had initially funded the company with his proceeds from Mako's IPO. After Mako was acquired in 2013 by medical device manufacturer Stryker Corp. for $1.7 billion, he invested some of those proceeds as well. Abovitz won't reveal the exact amount he spent to get the company running (in the millions is all he'll say), but he knew it wouldn't be nearly enough.", "Fortunately, the technology sold itself. When we'd talk to people about what we were doing, they didn't believe us, Abovitz says. Then they'd fly in and go, 'Oh ... you've actually made these things happen.' That was the dynamic of everyone who invested;  'This is impossible' to 'We want in.'", "In February 2014 Magic Leap announced it had raised more than $50 million in seed funding from private investors. Eight months later the company closed a Google-led $542 million series B funding round.", "We invested in Magic Leap because we believe their lightfield technology is the next big inflection point in technology after the PC, the Web and the smartphone, says James Joaquin of Obvious Ventures, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund he cofounded with Twitter's Evan Williams and a third partner. It has the potential to transform multiple global economic categories, including entertainment, education and productivity.", "Magic Leap's record-breaking $794 million series C round, announced in February 2016, was led by Alibaba and included follow-on investments from Google and Qualcomm Ventures, plus new money from Fidelity Investments, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and T. Rowe Price. I don't think it would be mischaracterizing it to say there was a frenzy, Thomas Tull says. This company has had absolutely no problem attracting blue-chip investors, and it's extraordinarily well capitalized at this point.", " Star Wars predicted it 40 years ago: R2-D2 and C-3PO interact with holograms, following a Magic Leap-Lucasfilm partnership.", "RONY ABOVITZ DOESN'T SEEM THE captain-of-industry type--unless your model mogul is Willy Wonka. Abovitz lights up like Roald Dahl's genius chocolatier as he leads a tour through Magic Leap's new headquarters in Plantation, Florida, a campus more befitting his vision than the nondescript offices 15 minutes away in Dania Beach that he's vacating. He points out cool machines, admires tools and invites guests to climb ladders to check out high-end air filters in the ductwork. He's friendly and cheery, very casual in speech and attire (often jeans and sweatshirts). People comment on what a nice guy he is as often as they mention his intellect.", "He's also liable to get lost in his work. On a recent Friday afternoon he was missing in action half an hour after a tour of the new HQ was scheduled to start--a not uncommon delay but a problematic one, since Abovitz comes from an Orthodox Jewish background and was planning to leave work early to observe the Sabbath. Eventually one of his executives discovered he had been on-site the whole time, sitting in his car in the parking lot, absentmindedly engrossed in a telephone call.", "Magic Leap broke ground on the new, 259,000-square-foot campus in October 2015 and expects the majority of its current 850 employees to move in before the end of this year. The rest of the workers are scattered in nine offices around the globe, not just in tech hot spots like Silicon Valley and Austin but also in far-flung outposts like Wellington, New Zealand, and Tel Aviv. Some groups are already in place at the new site, including a machine shop and several engineering teams. It's important to Abovitz to keep critical development teams together as part of an agile hardware model, which has allowed the company to produce literally many hundreds of iterations of its headset prototype. Part of why Magic Leap can iterate so fast is because we have all the right people in the right places, Abovitz says.", "The company is also building manufacturing facilities on the Plantation campus. This is the most spaceshippy part of Magic Leap, Abovitz says as he leads a group into the production line areas: a series of long, self-contained, modular bays lined up like submarines in a port. Each line can be activated as needed, ramping up production from thousands of units a year to more than a million.", "Abovitz wants Magic Leap to stay in Florida; one of the benefits of manufacturing there is that it allows the company to keep its secrets. If it were headquartered in Northern California, that would be nearly impossible, given Silicon Valley's job-hopping culture and well-lubricated rumor mill. Of course, he would also have an easier time hiring, but Magic Leap's technology has been a strong draw, pulling people in from the Valley and other tech hubs. We're bringing a crazy amount of very capable high-end engineering and manufacturing tech talent into Florida, he says.", " Evil robots invade your office in Weta Workshop's Dr. Grordbort game", "NATURALLY, ABOVITZ ISN'T THE ONLY entrepreneur who sees opportunity in this field. In just the past 12 months, $2.3 billion has been invested in virtual reality and augmented reality, as venture firms follow the money, according to Digi-Capital. And International Data Corp. says that worldwide revenues for the augmented and virtual reality market will grow from $5.2 billion this year to more than $162 billion in 2020.", "With that kind of growth, all the big names are scrambling to get a piece of the action. Google already dipped its toes into AR in 2013 with its ill-fated Google Glass, a pair of spectacles that made a virtual computer screen appear to float in front of the user. The project stalled in beta amid privacy and safety concerns, but Google's investment in Magic Leap indicates its ongoing interest. We knew from some of our earliest discussions with Rony and the team that we wanted to help them accelerate their vision into reality, says Don Harrison, vice president of corporate development at Google.", "Apple is working on AR as well, but it's unclear whether it is developing its own headset or adding capabilities to the iPhone. Silicon Valley startups like Meta (which has raised $73 million) and Atheer (a reported $23 million) are working on their own AR headsets and would presumably be natural acquisition candidates if they are successful.", "For now, however, Magic Leap's biggest competitor is Microsoft, which announced an augmented reality headset called HoloLens in 2014. A preproduction version, the HoloLens Development Edition, shipped to an unspecified number of Microsoft hardware and software developers in March of this year, and a consumer version could be released sometime in 2017. Microsoft has a big advantage in business because of their relationships, says Gartner research analyst Brian Blau. They're deep into business, and that's exactly where they positioned HoloLens.", "So now that it has a production line, what's Magic Leap's timing for entering the market? Soon-ish, says Abovitz, coyly. He's also reticent about what the headset will cost. Not a luxury product, he finally offers.", "Still, with Microsoft expected to release the consumer version of its HoloLens augmented reality headset sometime next year, it's clear that Magic Leap's gear must get onto shelves in the same window or it will risk losing ground to its biggest competitor. And with preorders for Meta's headset priced around $1,000, expect Magic Leap's new goggles to be in the same four-figure ballpark.", "Eventually Magic Leap sees its greatest impact in business applications, especially medical imaging and retail (imagine trying on garments at home, seamlessly). But as with most technologies, entertainment offerings will lead the way. Magic Leap is developing much of its content in-house and has already hired several well-known videogame designers, cartoonists, artists and writers. Neal Stephenson, author of Snow Crash, a seminal 1992 novel about virtual reality, is Magic Leap's chief futurist, working out of the company's Seattle office on an undisclosed game.", "Other content is coming from Abovitz's allies at Weta Workshop, which operates a 25-person lab with Magic Leap in New Zealand. Its first project, Dr. Grordbort's Invaders, is an action-oriented game set in a steampunk alternate universe: The player wields a ray gun and fights off evil robots that seem to break through the walls of his or her living room and fly around the house.", "In June Magic Leap also announced a strategic partnership with ILMxLAB, the immersive entertainment division of Lucasfilm, and opened a joint research lab on Lucasfilm's San Francisco campus. It's like being in the earliest days of cinema, says Vicki Dobbs Beck, the head of ILMxLAB.", "The collaboration has already produced several mixed-reality experiences set in the Star Wars universe, including one revealed at the time of the announcement that features the droids C-3P0 and R2-D2, and another, as-yet-unrevealed action sequence set in The Empire Strikes Back's iconic Battle of Hoth.

(The film goes wide on Christmas Day.)", "LOSER: Video- game movies This year\u2019s game-inspired films Warcraft and Ratchet & Clank both lost at the box office, as did the first-person-shooter-esque action film Hardcore Henry. (It\u2019s too early to tell for December\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed, but the reviews for the highly anticipated adaptation have not been kind.) Only The Angry Birds Movie escaped the game-to-film curse in 2016 \u2026 but that won\u2019t stop Hollywood, which has more than 50 video game films currently in development.

Now he\u2019s struggling to get his mojo back.

In 2016 CLO sales totaled 16.81 billion euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, about 3 billion euros more than last year, and a record volume in the post-crisis era.", "\u201cThe outlook for CLOs looks good next year, as the global hunt for yield continues and the overall macro backdrop is supportive for credit,\u201d said Jonathan Butler, Head of European Leveraged Finance at PGIM Fixed Income. \"We should see the loan market grow as sponsors opt for loans over bonds, while we don\u2019t see that defaults will pick up markedly next year. On the CLO investor side, we are seeing some of the best CLO 2.0 conditions for CLO issuing CLOs, with new investors finding equity attractive and CLO liability spreads tightening.\"", "Forecasts from bank analysts suggest issuance next year may be at least as much as this year, if not higher. Dominik Winnicki, credit strategist at Barclays Bank Plc, expects a total of 15 to 20 billion euros, while analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley predict roughly 20 billion euros.

In all, 29 issuers tapped the market with 40 transactions, the data show. GSO/Blackstone and PGIM both issued three CLOs this year and seven managers issued two. Last year\u2019s issuance came from 34 transactions and 24 managers, with three managers printing three transactions, and four managers printing two, the data show.", "There were fewer debutants in the market this year than last, with just four -- BlackRock, BlueMountain, Accunia and Och-Ziff -- compared with nine in 2015.", "CLO issuance this year has been shaped by an abundance of liquidity, from both CLO investors and across the broader markets. The ECB\u2019s accommodative policies helped make spreads on CLO debt attractive relative to other asset classes amid the wider hunt for yield.", "The CLO investor base diversified and expanded and included Japanese banks able to hoover up entire AAA-rated tranches. Demand from European accounts stepped up too with asset managers accounting for roughly 15 per cent of European AAA (1.0, 2.0 and recent 2.0 refis) buyers, according to data compiled by Citi. Banks represent roughly 44% of AAA buyers, insurance companies 35% with pension funds and family offices making up the rest, the data show.", "Increased competition for assets helped tighten spreads at the top of the CLO stack inside 100 basis points, with the most senior tranches ending the year at about 95-100 basis points from 145-150 basis points in January.", "It\u2019s been a different story for CLO mezzanine spreads, starting the year around mid-800 basis points and then ballooning out during the volatile first quarter to above 1,000 basis points, at least for some transactions. Despite some tightening over the summer, spreads have widened again during the final months. With such yields, buyers may be tempted by the attractive margin relative other credit opportunities.", "\"The gap between CLO double-Bs and loans looks wide compared to history, and with more tightening in loan spreads, double-Bs should benefit,\" said Ratul Roy, securitized product strategist at Citi in a Dec. 15 research note.", "At the bottom of the stack,\u00a0the CLO equity investor base has also expanded since the summer, as contracting liability spreads have boosted the potential returns available. Equity investors are also benefiting from the recent CLO refinancing trend as issuers reprice liability spreads tighter, helping the CLO arbitrage.", "To date, seven European CLO refis and three CLO resets have priced, and the trend is set to continue into 2017, assuming the buyer base for refi paper can accommodate the volume. Managers of early 2015 CLOs, still in their non-call periods and so unable to counter the collateral repricings via a refinancing, will be eager to get to work on these transactions as they become callable next year.", "As the investor base has diversified, so too have structures. As spreads on single B notes gapped out, these expensive tranches were stripped from structures. At least seven CLOs priced this year without single B tranches.", "Risk retention is a focus in the CLO market, and after the Brexit vote Europe\u2019s CLO managers switched from to manager originator from sponsor structures. Since then, managers of 15 of the 23 new CLOs have opted for the originator structure for risk-retention compliance, data compiled by Bloomberg show. This reversed the first half\u2019s trend, when 13 of the 18 CLOs issued prior to June 23 used a sponsor structure, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, ahead of the U.S. retention deadline on Dec. 24, two managers, CSAM and PGIM, became the first European managers to issue dual-compliant transactions.", "Regulation, collateral supply and macro shocks, which have threatened to dampen supply for several years, remain potential risks.\u00a0Particularly in the second half of the year, the market has taken macro events in its stride, helped by the ECB. Potential disrupting events include Trump\u2019s presidency, the triggering of Article 50 for Brexit, elections in France and Germany, and diverging interest rate policy around the globe.", "An end to the repricing trend in leveraged loans would be the holiday gift many investors might like, particularly after falling loan pricing dominated issuance during the second half of 2016, threatening CLO arbitrage.

Her left slowly follows. As she looks up, a smile spreads across her face.", "Exoskeletons, touted as devices that will allow the injured to walk, elderly people to remain independent for longer, the military to get more from soldiers and even turn all of us into mechanically enhanced humans, have captured the imagination of researchers across the world, from startups to Nasa.", "For now, the most obvious \u2013 and tangible \u2013 application has involved allowing paralysed people to stand and walk. \u201cIt was a mixture of surrealism and just absolute, just the most exhilarating feeling,\u201d says Morgan, describing her first experience of the technology four years ago.", "Now 31, the artist, model and presenter of Channel 4\u2019s 2016 Paralympic coverage was paralysed in a car accident aged 18 and has used a wheelchair ever since. The idea to try the exoskeleton, she says, came from the BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who uses a wheelchair after being shot while reporting from Saudi Arabia.", "The exoskeleton, from Rex Bionics, offered a life-changing experience, according to Morgan. \u201cIt had been 10 years, give or take, since I had properly stood, so that was in itself quite overwhelming,\u201d she says. The impact was far reaching. \u201cIt is not just about the joy of \u2018Oh, I am standing\u2019. It is the difference it makes, the way you feel afterwards, psychologically and physiologically \u2013 it is immeasurable.\u201d", "Returning to her wheelchair, says Morgan, is a disappointing experience. \u201cI am walking in my dreams, so it does blur that line \u2013 that liminal space between real and dream, and reality and fantasy,\u201d she says of the device.", "The exoskeleton isn\u2019t just about stirring excitement. As Morgan points out, there are myriad health problems associated with sitting for long periods of time. A report co-commissioned by Public Health England and published last year highlighted findings showing that, compared with those up and about the most, individuals who spend the longest time sitting are around twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes and have a 13% higher risk of developing cancer.", "Wheelchair users, adds Morgan, also face side-effects, from pressure sores to urinary tract infections. \u201cIt could be the difference between longevity and not for people like me,\u201d she says of the exoskeleton.", "About 40 of the Rex Bionic devices are currently in use worldwide, including in rehabilitation centres, says Richard Little, co-founder of the company. An engineer, Little says he was inspired to develop the system after his best friend and co-founder was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.", "But there is competition. As Little points out, the development of battery technology, processing power and components has brought a number of exoskeletons on to the market in recent years, including those from the US-based companies ReWalk and Ekso Bionics. \u201c[They] offer a whole load of different things which are similar in some ways but different in others,\u201d says Little. \u201c[Ours] doesn\u2019t use crutches,\u201d he points out, adding that the innovation removes the risk of users inadvertently damaging their shoulders, and frees their arms.", "There are tantalising signs that exoskeletons could do more than just aid rehabilitation or increase the mobility options for those who have experienced a stroke or spinal cord injury.", "While the bionic legs tried by Morgan are pre-programmed, researchers have developed exoskeletons controlled by a non-invasive system linked to the brain, allowing an even wider range of wheelchair users to walk. What\u2019s more, when combined with virtual reality and tactile feedback, the systems even appear to promote a degree of recovery for people with paraplegia.", "\u201cAll our patients got some degree of neurological recovery, which has never been documented in spinal cord injury,\u201d says Miguel Nicolelis, co-director of Duke University\u2019s centre for neuroengineering, who led the work.", "It\u2019s a development that excites Little, whose team have also been exploring the possibility of thought control with their own device.", "Yet despite their transformative capabilities, the limitations of such bulky exoskeletons have left many frustrated. Tim Swift, co-founder of the US startup Roam Robotics and one of the original researchers behind the exoskeleton from Ekso Bionics, is one of them.", "\u201cIt is a 50lb machine that costs $100,000 and has a half-mile-an-hour speed and can\u2019t turn,\u201d he says of his former work. \u201cThere are only so many applications where that makes sense. This is not a shift towards consumer, this is a hunt for somewhere we can actually use the technologies we are making.\u201d", "The dream, says Swift, is to create affordable devices that could turn us all into superhumans, augmenting our abilities by merging the biological with state of the art devices to unleash a new, improved, wave of soldiers, workers, agile pensioners and even everyday hikers. But in devising the underpinning technology, he says it is time to ditch the motors and metal approach that he himself pioneered.", "While hefty, rigid devices can support someone with paraplegia, says Swift, such exoskeletons are too heavy and costly for wider applications \u2013 such as helping a runner go faster. The fundamental challenge, he adds, is to create a device that remains powerful while keeping the weight down. \u201cI think you have two solutions,\u201d he says. The first is to develop a new, lightweight system that efficiently uses battery energy to generate movement. The second, he says, is to stick with metals and motors but be more intelligent in how you use them.", "Swift\u2019s answer is based on the former \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t received universal acclaim. \u201cI have spent the last two and a half years literally getting laughed out of conferences when I tell people we are going to make inflated exoskeletons,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople think it is a running joke.\u201d", "But Swift is adamant that to produce a system that can be used in myriad ways to augment humans, be it on the building site, in the home or up a mountain, technologists must innovate. And air, he believes, is the way to do it. The result, so far, is a series of proof-of-concept devices, braces that look a little like padded shin-guards, that can be strapped on to arms or legs.", "\u201cThe fundamentals allow you to have extremely lightweight structures [and] extremely low cost because everything is basically plastics and fabrics as opposed to precision machined metals,\u201d he says. And there is another boon. \u201cBecause you can make something that is very lightweight without sacrificing power, you are actually increasing the power density, which creates these opportunities to do highly dynamic behaviours.\u201d", "In other words, according to Swift, exoskeletons made of inflated fabric could not only boost a human\u2019s walking abilities, but also help them run, jump or even climb. \u201cWhen I say I want someone to go into Footlocker and buy a shoe that makes them run 25% faster \u2013 [we are] actively looking at things that look like that,\u201d he says.", "Others agree with Swift about the need to reduce the clunkiness of exoskeletons, but take a different approach.", "Hugh Herr is a rock climber, engineer and head of the biomechatronics research group at MIT. A double amputee, the result of a climbing accident on Mount Washington, Herr has pioneered the development of bionic limbs, inventing his own in the process. But it was in 2014 that his team became the first to make an all-important breakthrough: creating a powered, autonomous exoskeleton that could reduce the energy it took a human to walk.", "\u201cNo one is going to want to wear an exoskeleton if it is a fancy exercise machine, if it makes you sweat more and work harder, what is the point?\u201d says Herr. \u201cMy view is if an exoskeleton fails to reduce metabolism, one needs to start over and go back to the drawing board.\u201d", "To boost our bodies, says Herr, it is necessary to break the challenge down. \u201cWe are taking a first principle approach, and joint by joint understanding deeply what has to be done scientifically and technologically to augment a human,\u201d he says.", "For Herr the future is not inflatables (\u201cpneumatics tend to be very inefficient,\u201d he says) but minimalistic, stripping away the mass of conventional exoskeletons so that the device augments, rather than weighs down, the wearer. \u201cIf you separated the device from the human, it can\u2019t even uphold its own weight,\u201d he says.", "The approach, he adds, was to focus on the area of the body with biggest influence when it came to walking, \u201cArguably the most important muscle to bipedal human gait is the calf muscle,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we said in a minimalist design [with] minimal weight and mass, one arguably should build an artificial calf muscle.\u201d", "Boasting sensors for position, speed and force for feedback, and programmed to move and respond in a natural way, the device drives the foot forward, saving the wearer energy on each step. \u201cOur artificial calf muscle pushes the human in just the right time in the gait cycle where the human is most inefficient and after that period gets out of the way completely,\u201d he says.", "Herr isn\u2019t alone in focusing on such minimalist ankle-based devices. Among other pioneers is Conor Walsh at Harvard University who has created similar exoskeletons to help stroke patients walk.

The West Ham United manager has been forced to defend his club\u2019s new stadium, their stewarding set-up, the quality of the pitch, the intensity of his training regime and his players\u2019 propensity for injury. It has been tough. One upside to such a barrage of distractions, however, is that he has not had to talk about the football much.", "West Ham face Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium on Boxing day in what is not quite but nearly a six-pointer. Back-to-back home wins against Burnley and Hull City have moved the Hammers up to 13th but victories over the side now bottom of the league and the one with the worst away form in the division are not a cause for huge celebration and the manner in which they were achieved was not entirely convincing.", "Bilic acknowledges his side\u2019s recent form has been less than scintillating. He attributes the problem to a lack of mental confidence, a \u201ccramp\u201d that takes time to shake off, but one he expects to see less of in the coming weeks. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, we are still in danger but we have improved in everything and now I\u2019m expecting that cramp to be much, much less,\u201d he said before the Swansea match. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to see us more fluid with the ball, to have more movement off the ball, to go 20 yards to get the ball rather than stay in your position, to take more responsibility. All those things that have nothing to do with fitness, that have nothing to do with a game plan, but have a lot to do with the freedom in your head.\u201d", "There is no doubt that West Ham\u2019s players have been nervous this term, be it because of their league position or from trying to impress in their new surroundings at Stratford. But nerves alone cannot cover it. There are problems at West Ham that extend beyond the freedom in players\u2019 heads and do, in fact, have something to do with a game plan.", "Look at West Ham\u2019s team selection this past month and the only thing consistent is the inconsistency. Bilic went with a back four for the hammering by Arsenal and stuck with it for a creditable point at Liverpool. He then ditched it for a back three against Burnley before reverting to a four in the second half against Hull. Gauging West Ham\u2019s shape this season has sometimes been a challenge similar to finding a sailboat in a magic eye picture.", "Alongside changes in formation came changes in personnel. In the four matches mentioned above there were three different right-sided defenders; \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa, Havard Nordtveit and Cheikh Kouyat\u00e9. During the same period Michail Antonio, whom his manager saw as a right-back earlier in the season, played wing-back, inside-forward and centre-forward. If Bilic is looking for fluidity in the team\u2019s play, he would surely benefit from more consistency in selection.", "The Hammers have, of course, been hamstrung by injury this season. From Andy Carroll\u2019s three months out to the \u00a320m signing Andr\u00e9 Ayew being forced off on his debut to the absence of the man originally tasked with that right-back role, Sam Byram. The latest to join the list are Diafra Sakho and the Turkish international G\u00f6khan T\u00f6re; both are expected to be out until the spring.", "Perhaps this list is simple ill fortune but it still casts a stark light on West Ham\u2019s recruitment policy. The club brought in no fewer than four forwards in the summer \u2013 Ayew being joined by Simone Zaza, Jonathan Calleri and Ashley Fletcher \u2013 but Bilic still feels the loss of Sakho to be a big blow. And with those four forwards having scored zero league goals between them, it is easy to see why. At right-back the club added the Spain international Arbeloa, fresh from a guard of honour on leaving Real Madrid. He has played only three times and has not been seen since the 5-1 capitulation to Arsenal.", "West Ham will go back for another striker and full-back in the January transfer window but the suspicion lingers that new acquisitions are not the panacea for the club\u2019s on-pitch ills. Instead it is an absence of identity, ironic given the furore over the club\u2019s new home, that is the problem.", "Last season West Ham had a porous defence and a midfield that made up in endeavour for what it lacked in technical ability. That this average Premier League set-up still managed to knock on the door of the Champions League was down to one man: Dimitri Payet. The France midfielder had one of the best debut seasons in Premier League history. He is far from that level this time round. Just as pronounced is the drop-off in form of his partner in crime from last season, Manuel Lanzini. Signed permanently in the summer for just under \u00a310m, the Argentinian was taken off at half-time against Hull.", "Payet is at the heart of Bilic\u2019s problems. Does he build his team around an exceptional player who sounds unsettled? Or does he take better advantage of a sizeable squad to construct a team of complementary abilities? Currently the sense is that Bilic is pursuing the former tactic, as befits a club that now want to compete with the big boys and need a superstar to sell them.", "Results may soon force a rethink. After Swansea and Leicester come the two Manchester sides, which will provide decisive proof of whether the team\u2019s form has improved as the Croat predicted. If it has not, Bilic might have to change tack and try to incorporate Payet into a less ambitious, more collective effort. If, that is, he is given the chance."], "targetTitle": "Slaven Bilic sees cause for optimism but West Ham are still struggling to click", "postTimestamp": "Sun Dec 25 15:04:56 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "West Ham United,Slaven Bilic,Football,Sport", "targetDescription": "West Ham\u2019s results are improving but Slaven Bilic is yet to find a formula that incorporates the talents of Dimitri Payet and his string of summer signings into a coherent collective"}

Inside the epic patent war"], "id": "812988530305695744", "targetCaptions": [], "targetParagraphs": ["In the very best invention stories, the tinkerer spends years toiling in obscurity before the big breakthrough. Jennifer Doudna\u2019s story is like that. The 52-year-old biochemist grew up in Hawaii, studied at Pomona College and Harvard, and later joined the faculty at the University of California at Berkeley. While the rest of the scientific world seemed fixated on DNA, the blueprint of all biology, Doudna built detailed maps of RNA, which had long been thought of as the loyal foot soldier following DNA\u2019s orders. Doudna was trying to figure out more precisely what role RNA plays in human genetics\u2014the various ways it can actually control genes. For years, DNA remained the focus of most everyone else\u2019s research. \u201cI definitely had some sleepless nights,\u201d she says, \u201cjust wondering, Is this the right decision, should I be doing this?\u201d", "Then one day in 2011, Doudna was approached at a conference by a French microbiologist named Emmanuelle Charpentier, who wanted to talk about a phenomenon called Crispr. Until then, most biologists understood Crispr, assuming they\u2019d heard of it at all, to be an antiviral system found in bacteria. The bacteria used it to identify invading viruses and activate special proteins that would bind to the viral DNA and snip it out. No one had successfully found a plausible way to adapt and re-create that bacterial process in a more complex biological system\u2014like a human being. Whoever could pull that off might be able to cure diseases, alter the genetic code, and even change the human species. It all sounded like science fiction, of course, until Charpentier told Doudna that Crispr seemed to interact with a protein called Cas9 in an extraordinary way.", "The two decided to join forces, and one year later published a study detailing how they\u2019d adapted the Crispr-Cas9 editing technique to not just cut but paste genes into any bacteria\u2014that is, customize a bacterium\u2019s DNA makeup along whichever lines they chose, with little fuss. The technique was enormously promising. Editing the human genome had been possible for a few years, but slowly, imprecisely, and with great difficulty. Crispr-Cas9 might eventually make it almost as straightforward as the search-and-replace feature of a word processor. What if one day, using Crispr, we could edit out Alzheimer\u2019s, schizophrenia, or cancer? Soon, the two scientists were onstage with Cameron Diaz, accepting the Silicon Valley-funded $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. They were on everybody\u2019s shortlist for the Nobel prize, their work hailed as the great biotech advancement of the century. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have predicted it,\u201d Doudna says.", "That\u2019s a nice story, but there\u2019s another. It\u2019s about Feng Zhang, a 34-year-old molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Zhang was born in China and raised in Iowa, and he quickly became a star at Harvard and Stanford, where he was obsessed with finding the perfect way to reprogram human cells. \u201cI\u2019ve always been focused on genome editing,\u201d he says. In 2011, the same year Doudna met Charpentier, Zhang attended a conference at the Broad Institute, in the same building as his lab, and heard a speaker offhandedly mention the Crispr immune system in bacteria. Zhang read everything he could find on the subject. He fixated particularly on a Canadian biologist\u2019s 2010 paper noting the exceptional utility of the Cas9 protein.", "Zhang spent months testing Cas9 enzymes, and was preparing to publish his findings in 2012, when Doudna and Charpentier\u2019s paper came out. In Zhang\u2019s paper, published a few months later, he showed how he\u2019d successfully harnessed Crispr with Cas9 to edit a gene in a eukaryotic cell\u2014that is, a cell with a nucleus. In the eyes of some, that distinction vaulted him ahead of Doudna and Charpentier. To edit a bacterial gene, the way Doudna had, was one thing; to actually monkey with the building blocks of humanity was another.", "Every decade or so, a fundamentally new genetic technology comes along that could change everything. In the 1970s it was restriction enzymes, the tools for recombinant DNA, which turbocharged the development of new medicines and the tools of basic biological research. In the \u201980s, the polymerase chain reaction revolutionized day-to-day molecular biology by making it much easier to quickly copy a piece of DNA thousands of millions of times, speeding the pace of medical research even further. In the \u201990s, next-generation DNA sequencing pushed forward the study of the genome to a level once thought impossible. Now there\u2019s Crispr, which could trounce them all.", "The name, coined in 2002 by Spanish researcher Francisco Mojica, is short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (you can tell somebody really wanted to spell \u201cCrispr\u201d). Today it\u2019s understood to be, potentially, a cheap and quick way to fix anything about a genetic code. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as fundamental as the transistor,\u201d says Andrew May, the chief scientific officer at Caribou Biosciences, a Crispr startup co-founded by Doudna in 2011. \u201cIf you think of DNA as the fundamental sort of software code that underpins the computer that cells are, you\u2019re essentially programming those cells. You can target any piece of DNA and change it.\u201d", "In the popular imagination, Crispr has prompted alarmed speculation about eugenics, designer babies, and hubris worthy of Jurassic Park. The results may be able to change inheritable traits that could forever alter the nature of any species\u2014not just mosquitoes, which a British company named Oxitec plans to tinker with in the Florida Keys using a gene-modifying technique that predates Crispr. Researchers in China have already tried out Crispr-Cas9 on human embryos. They never intended to implant the embryos in mothers and reported mixed success at best. Yet the attempt shook many in the scientific community. In June, a federal biosafety and ethics panel approved human trials of Crispr-Cas9 by a University of Pennsylvania team that has the backing of Napster co-founder and itinerant entrepreneur Sean Parker. Home hobbyists, meanwhile, are using Crispr to fiddle with yeast in petri dishes, splicing together who-knows-what. Harvard researcher George Church appears serious about a plan to use Crispr to bring back the woolly mammoth.", "Nearer-term advances could change our lives in more welcome ways. Researchers around the world see Crispr\u2019s precision as a perfect tool for curing single-gene illnesses like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and an inherited form of blindness called LCA 10. \u201cThere are 6,000 or so genetic diseases, and 95 percent of them don\u2019t have any proved therapies,\u201d says Katrine Bosley, chief executive officer of Editas Medicine, a Cambridge, Mass., Crispr startup. \u201cIn this day and age, we have a deep knowledge of the human genome and how to make genetic medicines that we didn\u2019t have 5, 10 years ago.\u201d", "IPO", "Market value:", "$900 million", "in equity sales;", "pharma partnerships", "worth $440 million", "IPO", "Market value:", "$900 million", "donated by Sean Parker;", "first Crispr-Cas9", "human trial in pipeline", "AstraZeneca and Novartis have teamed up with Crispr startups to develop and bring drugs to market. Beyond cures, Crispr is being viewed as a way to make cancer drugs more effective, to build a better class of antivirals to fight HIV, and to modify pig organs to make them more suitable as transplants for humans. In just a few years, the technique could make its way into everything from medicine to agriculture to biofuels\u2014anything involving a gene. Imagine genetically modified crops that, with Crispr\u2019s assistance, don\u2019t use any genes other than their own, sidestepping the GMO controversy. DuPont is already working with Caribou on mushrooms that stay white after being cut, and told Doudna it has 25 Crispr-related products in the pipeline, including corn, soybeans, wheat, and rice.", "For a time, Zhang and Doudna were cordial. Along with a few other molecular biologists, they joined the board of Editas. Then, in 2014, the federal government granted Zhang the first patent on Crispr-Cas9. Although Doudna and Charpentier enjoyed a wave of glowing press, Zhang stood to get the money and, maybe, the spot in the history books. Doudna left Editas a month later; though she says the reason was too many cross-country commutes for board meetings, she helped found a new startup, Intellia Therapeutics, that would be directly competing for venture capital. The race for funding was on. Bill Gates and Google Ventures were among the contributors to Editas\u2019s $120 million Series B investment round\u2014Gates is particularly enthusiastic about altering entire mosquito populations to stop malaria\u2014and the company netted an additional $94.4 million in a February initial public offering. Intellia, in turn, raised $112.9 million when it went public in May. Charpentier\u2019s Crispr Therapeutics has yet to go public but has raised $198 million in venture funding and has contracts with Bayer and Vertex Pharmaceuticals worth a combined $440 million. \u201cAll I can say is that we did it in my lab with Jennifer Doudna,\u201d she told one reporter in 2014. \u201cI am very confident that the future will clarify the situation.\u201d All told, Crispr companies have attracted more than $1 billion of venture capital and other funding, even as credit for the technology and its relevant patent remain a matter of dispute.", "Next came the litigation. In 2015, UC Berkeley\u2019s lawyers filed a claim on behalf of Doudna with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, seeking to strip Zhang and the Broad Institute\u2019s hold on Crispr-Cas9. Proceedings began this spring, but the most dramatic part is still to come. In November, Doudna and Zhang may have to take the stand, each asserting under oath that she or he deserves the patent for what may well be the biological advancement of our age. The stakes are sky-high. Billions of dollars in revenue. Control over entire industries yet to be born. And, perhaps, the future of human evolution.", "\u201cI\u2019m really an outsider to the genome-editing field,\u201d Doudna says. \u201cOther folks, they\u2019ve been in this field, whereas we\u2019re coming at this from a very different point of view.\u201d It\u2019s late on a Friday afternoon at UC Berkeley, and Doudna, tall and thin and cheerfully focused, is seated in her office with a sweeping view of the campus, fiddling with a 3D-printed model of the Cas9 protein\u2014a plastic toy, really, a bit larger than a football\u2014that she keeps nearby to explain the Crispr technique to visitors. She still marvels at Crispr\u2019s utility as \u201ca democratizing technology. It just opens the door to anybody who has basic skills in molecular biology and wants to do some genome editing.\u201d That includes those who might want to customize a newborn\u2019s genes. Doudna has helped lead the effort to encourage ethical uses of Crispr, but she\u2019s not for a complete moratorium on human experimentation. \u201cOn one hand, you can say maybe it\u2019s not right to do that ever, but you can also say in vitro fertilization clinics already do that every day.\u201d Her lab is working on curing the neurodegenerative disorder known as Huntington\u2019s disease.", "The only part of her Crispr story Doudna hesitates to comment on is the battle for credit. For two years, UC Berkeley and the Broad Institute have engaged in a simmering public-relations war over who invented the Crispr-Cas9 method, each spinning its version in press releases and video primers. For her part, Doudna says her work with RNA molecules made her research distinctive. Everyone else, she says, was looking at DNA. That would include Zhang. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always found interesting in science,\u201d she says, \u201cis making connections between things that are not necessarily connected or don\u2019t appear to be connected.\u201d", "Across the country, Zhang\u2019s lab in Cambridge is at the Broad Institute in Kendall Square, the world nexus of biotech investment and research, a five-minute walk from Editas\u2019s offices. When I visit a week after meeting with Doudna, Zhang greets me with a warm, confident smile. Boyish and upbeat, he\u2019s eager to discuss his lab\u2019s latest advances in Crispr techniques: the methods he\u2019s found to make the editing more precise; his ambition to map out complex brain diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s; the protein he found that works as well as Cas9 and which he owns the patent to, free and clear. If Doudna is an outsider to the gene-editing world, Zhang is a native, an Intel Science Talent Search finalist who\u2019s been devoted to the idea of reprogramming DNA since 1993, when an after-school program in Des Moines took him to see Jurassic Park.", "Unlike Doudna, who badly wants to shape the way the public thinks about Crispr, Zhang isn\u2019t interested in ethical conversations about designer babies, which he says are a long way off. \u201cThe thing everybody should focus on is how we can push this technology forward, so we can actually treat a disease,\u201d he says.", "Zhang is as quietly focused as Doudna in asserting his ownership of Crispr. Without ever saying her name, he argues that her big Crispr paper with Charpentier didn\u2019t actually scoop him, because they stuck with bacteria and used the Cas9 protein in a different way. \u201cYou have to test it in the actual system that you want to get it to work in,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing else is going to be able to fully predict what will happen.\u201d", "The entire Harvard and MIT apparatus appears to have lined up behind Zhang\u2019s version. In January, Eric Lander, president of the Broad Institute, published an elaborate history of Crispr in the journal Cell that spread credit around to a host of researchers over years. The effect, more than one Doudna supporter protested, was to vastly downplay her contribution. Amid the tempest that followed, Doudna called Lander\u2019s article \u201cfactually incorrect.\u201d Still, Lander\u2019s broader point\u2014that today\u2019s discoveries are often an ensemble effort\u2014does resonate with Doudna. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t disagree with that, yeah,\u201d she says.", "Does it follow, then, that the patent system should allow people to share credit? Doudna takes a moment before answering. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be a while,\u201d she says, \u201cbefore I have enough perspective that I can really answer that question.\u201d", "Illustration: Blacki Migliozzi for Bloomberg Businessweek", "Many were surprised that Zhang received the Crispr-Cas9 patent, given that Doudna published first and filed for her patent seven months ahead of him. The reason: Zhang had paid $70 to have his application expedited. Some have interpreted that as a slimy move; the patent lawyers and experts I spoke with say that may have been his only option to avoid his application being deemed in conflict with Doudna\u2019s. In any case, almost immediately after Zhang got his first patent on April 15, 2014, UC Berkeley amended Doudna\u2019s application to counter his claim. Then a few third parties, their identities still not made public, filed briefs to block Doudna. The patent war had begun.", "The Broad Institute produced lab notebooks and private e-mails to bolster its case that Zhang\u2019s idea was original and that Doudna\u2019s predictions that Crispr-Cas9 would work in humans was \u201cmere conjecture.\u201d UC Berkeley claimed Zhang\u2019s notebooks were missing key information, going so far as to say the Broad Institute \u201cwithheld or misrepresented material information with the intent to deceive\u201d the patent office. Preliminary meetings with a judge this spring generated more heat than light, and UC Berkeley\u2019s objections failed to get any traction. Next, in what\u2019s called the interlocutory phase, a panel of three patent judges will be handed the task of determining who invented Crispr-Cas9.", "\u201cThe Berkeley lab is going to say they had the building blocks,\u201d says Sarah Chapin Columbia, an intellectual-property litigator with McDermott Will & Emery in Boston. \u201cThe MIT-Harvard lab is going to say, \u2018We put the building blocks in the right orientation.\u2019 To a patent geek, that\u2019s going to be a very interesting thing to watch.\u201d", "There\u2019s one more major quirk. The entire dispute, called an \u201cinterference\u201d case because the patent claims are said to interfere with one another, is moving forward based on a set of rules that have been changed since it was filed. Under the old rules, the scientist deemed the \u201cfirst to invent\u201d wins. Under the new rules, the patent goes to the \u201cfirst to file,\u201d matching the system in many other countries. The new system operates under the assumption that the early filer will be the best able to build an industry around the invention, says Kevin Noonan, a biotech patent expert and partner with law firm McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff in Chicago. \u201cSo these days we don\u2019t care so much if the right person gets the patent,\u201d he says. \u201cIt may not be more fair, but it\u2019s simpler.\u201d", "Even if the current patent system encourages innovation, the rules hardly seem fair to the inventors\u2014or true to the reality of invention itself. Does this process accurately reflect the way people from Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla on down have tended to invent things in parallel? Science thrives when scientists share data and ideas, but the winner-take-all patent system almost forces scientists to guard their best stuff. And when patents are contested, the proceedings can be brutal. \u201cEvery piece of evidence has to be independently corroborated by somebody who swears under oath that it\u2019s true,\u201d Noonan says. \u201cToo often, things can get shaded, because your recollections are not consistent with reality. Especially when having those recollections means you make a lot of money.\u201d", "The best thing you can say about the process, perhaps, is that it can motivate people to settle for some sort of cross-licensing arrangement. \u201cThat\u2019s really the smart thing to do,\u201d Noonan says. \u201cIf they settle, then they both win.\u201d If one party wins, appeals could last years. There\u2019s always the possibility the panel of judges will award the patent to neither party. And the longer they battle over the patent, the more risk to its licensing value. Zhang isn\u2019t the only researcher trying to invent a way around this patent, finding proteins besides Cas9 that work with Crispr. The search is moving quickly: In June, the journal Science published a study showing how the technique could be used to manipulate not just DNA but RNA, too. And the patented version may well fail human clinical trials or face years of delays like gene therapy did after 1999, when one of the volunteers in a human trial died.", "Yet an April filing in the case showed the parties have discussed settling and held off. For now, the various Crispr companies\u2019 investors are holding tight. \u201cWe knew it was high-risk,\u201d says Kevin Bitterman of Polaris Partners, the venture firm that helped form Editas with Flagship Ventures and Third Rock Ventures. \u201cWe did a lot of due diligence on the intellectual property and feel very confident in the company\u2019s position.\u201d", "It\u2019s not possible with any degree of certainty to pick the eventual winners. \u201cEvery investor in the Crispr space thus far is essentially betting on a horse race,\u201d says Jacob Sherkow, a New York Law School professor who is following the dispute. \u201cIf you\u2019re paying Caribou Biosciences for a license on their technology\u201d\u2014that is, the technology Caribou licensed from Doudna\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re essentially gambling on them winning. And if Caribou loses, then you never had to pay that money. But you know, it\u2019s a transformational piece of technology. So it\u2019s better to get in on it now than to wait. There\u2019s that Warren Buffett quote\u2014\u2018If you wait for the robins, spring will be over.\u2019 \u201d", "Patents might not be the most important front in the Crispr war. They\u2019re good for only 20 years, after all; history is forever. The Nobel committee typically honors no more than three people per discovery, no matter how many actually worked on it. Doudna, Charpentier, and Zhang aren\u2019t the only contenders: Media reports have also lauded Harvard\u2019s Church, DuPont\u2019s Philippe Horvath, and Rodolphe Barrangou of North Carolina State University for their work on Crispr.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of competition,\u201d Doudna says. \u201cIt\u2019s true in any human endeavor. People get excited about an idea, and then a lot of people go after it.\u201d She\u2019s flattered but a little worried about the flurry of attention. \u201cIt would be so easy to get so distracted by all this stuff going on that I would never really do any real science again,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s actually my worst nightmare.\u201d", "Still, she knows the real advancements require money. \u201cIs a cure for Huntington\u2019s going to come from an academic lab?\u201d she asks. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just not going to. Do we have the resources to do clinical trials and all of the work to figure out really how to deliver this as a drug? No. That has to be done in a commercial setting.\u201d So she\u2019s embracing the commercial aspects of Crispr. \u201cI want to see this used. I want to see it really solve real problems. I don\u2019t care who does it, but if somebody has a cure for an eye disease or for a sickle-cell trait or for something like that, it\u2019s going to be fantastic. That\u2019s what I would love to see happen.\u201d", "Zhang is similarly fixated on perfecting the invention. \u201cThere\u2019s so much hype around this, and there are so many things we have to work out,\u201d he says. \u201cHow safe is the system in the body? How do we put it in the right organ? We have to work on resolving those questions. And all these other issues, they are really beside the point.\u201d", "How uncomfortable is it to be caught in the middle of a highly visible struggle over a major scientific legacy? \u201cI didn\u2019t start to work on this because I wanted to get a patent,\u201d Zhang says. \u201cIf we can treat a disease, I mean, that\u2019s what moves the world forward. It\u2019s not patents or credit or anything like that.\u201d", "When I tell him Doudna says almost the same thing, he takes a long pause. Finally, he answers. \u201cFor me, I think the primary goal is to do something useful,\u201d he says. \u201cI think if you actually do something useful, you\u2019ll get rewarded.

A number of incidents in the past few weeks have made me uncomfortable and left me feeling helpless.", "Incident No. 1: Every day we choose a book of the day. I chose \u201cAnother Day in the Death of America,\u201d by Gary Younge. I had him as a professor for two semesters, had just finished the book and wanted to promote it. An older white lady asked me about the book, and I gave her a summary and mentioned I had a personal connection to the author. She asked where I went to school. I told her New York City. She proceeded to go on about inner-city violence and how her son lived in New York and she wanted him to be aware of the guns and isn\u2019t it a shame. She talked about how everyone she knew had guns, but they weren\u2019t shooting anyone, and it was those \u201cFerguson people\u201d who were the real problem. I did not know what to say and thankfully she checked out and left.", "Incident No. 2: An older white couple came in looking for a specific book. They did not know what it was called and only knew it was about Detroit before the recession. Somehow the husband got onto the topic of inner-city problems. I engaged him lightly, trying not to show my horror when he said that everyone was on drugs in Chicago and Detroit. He went on to say that the government should just stick them all on an island, airdrop food and let them kill each other; he did not want his taxes to go toward helping them.", "I have been thinking about this a lot. I do not know what my ethical position should be when people express their offensive opinions and I am just trying to sell them a book. Granted, I will try to put something like James Baldwin or the new essay collection \u201cThe Fire This Time\u201d onto people\u2019s radar. I know I am giving my opinion and may be seen as an outsider who has some \u201cagenda,\u201d but what can I do when people say offensive and destructive things while I am at work?", "What would a good response be? I feel strongly that the opinions they have just shared are negative and detrimental to conversations about race and this country. But how do I balance that feeling with respecting my customers? I feel like I cannot say anything, yet they are perpetuating hateful beliefs. I have kept my mouth shut and smiled and tried to not give my opinion, but I feel like I am ignoring my own disgust and somehow perpetuating racist beliefs. Name Withheld", "You speak of racist beliefs. There seem to be two kinds here. One class consists of false statements of fact: It isn\u2019t even a reasonable hyperbole to say that every African-American in Detroit is on drugs. What makes beliefs like these racist (and not merely mistaken) is that they tend to reflect hostility toward black people in general and a consequent biased reading of the evidence. Sometimes people are simply passing on thoughts they have acquired from others without much reflection. But in this day and age, accepting beliefs of this sort is usually a sign that you have negative attitudes. The false beliefs are not the basis of the attitudes; it\u2019s the other way round.", "A second class of beliefs is inherently repugnant, not merely in their genesis (or their effects) but in their content; they convey sentiments toward people that nobody should have. Fantasizing about dumping black people onto an island where they kill one another \u2014 you don\u2019t need fact-checking to see the moral problems here. You mention the election cycle. It hasn\u2019t escaped notice that President-elect Trump\u2019s speeches have encouraged the expression of racist attitudes and ideas. Demons have been loosed, and I suspect we will be living with the consequences for some time.", "So the problems that you describe aren\u2019t likely to go away anytime soon. You have a couple of responsibilities here. One is as the manager of a business. You don\u2019t want to drive away too many customers. But a second is as a citizen. When citizens address one another in the course of everyday interactions on topics of public morality, they should speak to each other truthfully and respectfully. When someone says something morally repugnant, failing to respond with disapproval is failing to take that person seriously as a moral agent. It\u2019s a sign not of respect but of contempt, or perhaps cowardice. If you say nothing, you may give the impression that you agree, or at the very least that you think what they\u2019re saying falls within the range of respectable opinion. The episodes you cite fall outside that range.", "Your challenge is to find a polite way to say that you disagree. If your customers defend what they have said, you have the opening to argue against their views. But precisely because their views are likely to be rationalizations of a previous antipathy, they may not be terribly susceptible to reasoned argument. Getting angry probably won\u2019t help, either. Try something like, \u201cIf you knew more about the lives of black Americans, you wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d And then offer one of the books you mention. (Or show them this column.)", "My summer house is in a remote area of the Ozarks. Our new neighbors are hard-working, pleasant people, but they are hoarders of junk and \u2014 worse \u2014 dogs. These poor creatures live in pens or are chained up outside. Last count: more than a dozen. I researched animal-cruelty laws in my state (Missouri), and it seems that unless the dogs lack adequate food, water, shelter and health care, it is difficult to prove neglect. (The state does have an anticruelty law that could be applicable, but it hasn\u2019t adopted an antitethering law.) But where do the dogs come from? Where do they go? New ones appear from time to time, but many live day in, day out in the same deplorable conditions. When I talk to one of my neighbors about the dogs, he is quite proud and seemingly fond of them. I could report my neighbors to an animal-cruelty organization or have friends report them, but either way, because of our remote location, my neighbor is likely to suspect that I reported him, and I could find myself losing my vacation home in a mysterious fire. Plus, it is likely that the lax laws in our state won\u2019t help the animals anyway. We are currently on friendly terms with the neighbors, but I can\u2019t stand to see the animals treated this way. I believe hoarding is a mental illness and no amount of reasoning with the neighbors will help. Name Withheld", "Some experts think animal hoarding is a psychiatric disorder, and there are tools for assessing the problem and some approaches to treating it. That disorder might thwart intervention, because one of the symptoms is difficulty in recognizing that you have a problem. But the way you describe your neighbor, he doesn\u2019t meet many of the criteria on the Homes Multidisciplinary Hoarding Risk Assessment. So your neighbor might be unaware of any cruelty here. If you\u2019re sure he\u2019s doing wrong by these animals, you have a strong reason to try to get him to change his ways.", "What about talking to the neighbor about why the dogs might be better off if they were treated differently? Encouraging him to find other homes for some of them, and perhaps offering to help with that? If the dogs need exercise, you might also volunteer to take them for walks, explaining that you would enjoy spending time with them.", "But you don\u2019t mention the possibility of having a conversation along these lines, and that\u2019s presumably because you don\u2019t think it would do any good. Maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe in the Ozarks interventions of this sort would be considered nosy or officious. Maybe your neighbors are indeed beyond reason. Even though you\u2019re \u201con friendly terms,\u201d you clearly think your neighbor is capable of being dangerously hostile if he takes against you. If your understanding of the situation is correct, there\u2019s not much you can safely do. But (again, bias alert) what evidence do you have of that? Perhaps you\u2019re being influenced by stereotypes about country folks of the sort promulgated by \u201cStraw Dogs\u201d or \u201cDeliverance\u201d?

But being honest about it, I thought this rap was bum. The miserly Dutchman was a stereotype, and in my experience not an accurate one.", "Besides, the Dutch had too much company. The British were hardly hesitant about developing massive, relatively costly instruments for radio astronomy after the war. Nonetheless, they never did any SETI. Ditto the French, Spanish, and Germans. The Italians, alone among the Europeans, had made an effort to eavesdrop on E.T., setting up a very sophisticated project at the Medicina Observatory near Bologna. But that experiment is now past tense.", "The Russians were early SETI enthusiasts, and made major scholarly contributions to the field. But their efforts ended when the Soviet Union imploded.", "Bottom line? Today, SETI is solely an American enterprise. And even then, it's pretty minimal. SETI is not on the back burner \u2026 it's on the pilot light. The total number of researchers can be tallied on your extremities, and there's essentially no government funding. The effort is tiny, but at least there's effort.", "So what's going on here? If a dozen other countries have the telescopes, the money, and the research horsepower to search for cosmic company, why is this extraordinarily profound quest confined to the U.S.?", "An obvious answer would be to suggest that the problem is too open-ended. It's possible that even if we poured huge amounts of money into the search, nothing would be found. Bookies can't give sensible odds for success, even to those willing to gamble. Other countries are just being practical.", "That may be true, but I find it too facile and, frankly, too depressing. If every attempt at exploration was required to guarantee success in advance, there would be precious little of it. The British would never have sent John Franklin into the Canadian arctic to hunt down the water route capping the Americas, or Captain Cook into the high latitudes of the South Pacific to look for a possible continent at the bottom of the globe.", "And besides, that doesn't really explain why the Americans continue to try.", "So I've resorted to amateur sociology to provide justification. Unlike the countries of Europe, America still resonates to its pioneering heritage, and that heritage is stunningly recent. The frontier closed in 1890, the era of my great-grandfather. America's heroes, for better or worse are still those who forsook the security of the known to cross into harsh and dangerous territories and remake their lives.", "These heroes were willing to accept long odds if the payoff was big. They were also willing to accept failure, and stand up to try again. These are behaviors that the long-settled societies of Europe have subdued.", "But there may be hope. With the recent discovery that the universe is studded with planets, and indications that a fair fraction of them might be sympathetic to life, SETI has become a popular topic both in Europe and in several Asian countries. It's neither a ridiculous nor a risible enterprise.", "So my desire is that these countries will soon change their minds, and not be too sober to put their money where their mouths are.

Horacio Corbacho, 55, and three other men. AP", "Priest Nicola Corradi is taken handcuffed and on a wheelchair to a courtroom in Argentina\u2019s northwestern Mendoza province, Dec. 22, 2016.\u00a0 Emmanuel Rodriguez Villegas, AP"], "targetParagraphs": ["LUJAN DE CUYO, Argentina -- The children told prosecutors the two Roman Catholic priests repeatedly raped them by an image of the Virgin Mary inside the small school chapel in remote northwestern Argentina. Only their tormenters would have heard their cries because the other children at the school were deaf. The clerical sex abuse scandal unfolding at the Antonio Provolo Institute for hearing impaired children in Mendoza province would be shocking enough on its own. Except that dozens of students in the Provolo Institute\u2019s school in Italy were similarly abused for decades, some of whom allegedly by the same priest who now stands formally charged of raping and molesting young deaf Argentines. And the Vatican knew about the Rev. Nicola Corradi since at least 2009, when the Italian Provolo students went public with tales of shocking abuse against the most vulnerable of children and named names. While the Vatican ordered an investigation and sanctioned four accused priests, Corradi apparently never was sanctioned for his alleged crimes in Italy.\u00a0", "The Verona diocese apologized to the Italian students in 2012. After the students again named Corradi as an abuser living in Francis\u2019 native Argentina in a 2014 letter to the pope and the Verona bishop, the Vatican still took no action. Though this year a Vatican official said Pope Francis wanted to assure the victims that the church was taking measures to protect children and prevent sexual abuse.\u00a0 But at least 24 students of the Provolo institute in Argentina have now come forward seeking justice for the abuse they say they suffered at the hands of Corradi, 82, another priest, the Rev. Horacio Corbacho, 55, and three other men. The five were arrested in late November by police who raided the school in Argentina\u2019s Mendoza province and found magazines featuring naked women and about $34,000 in Corradi\u2019s room.\u00a0 All the suspects are being held at a jail in Mendoza and have not spoken publicly since their arrest. Corradi\u2019s attorney, Pablo Kletzl, on Friday declined to comment on the case. \u00a0\u00a0", "Victims and prosecutors say the anal and vaginal rapes, fondling and oral sex allegedly committed by the priests took place in the bathrooms, dorms, garden and a basement at the school in Lujan de Cuyo, a city about 620 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. The school has \u201ca little chapel with an image of the Virgin and some chairs where the kids would get confession and receive the communion. That\u2019s where some of the acts were happening,\u201d former lead prosecutor Fabrizio Sidoti told The Associated Press of the stories he heard from the alleged victims after the scandal broke. Children from other regions of Argentina who lived at the dorms were said to be especially vulnerable and targeted often. The tales they have told are harrowing: One of the alleged victims told AP she witnessed how a girl was raped by one priest while the other one forced her to give him oral sex. The Argentine courts said the alleged victims in the case in that country could not be publicly identified and AP does not identify people who may have been sexually assaulted unless they voluntarily identify themselves. \u201cThey always said it was a game: \u2018Let\u2019s go play, let\u2019s go play\u2019 and they would take us to the girls\u2019 bathroom,\u201d said one of the women who claims that she was abused at the school in Argentina. The prosecutor is expecting more than 20 other people to provide testimony and more people claiming abuse to come forward. Pope Francis has not spoken publicly about the case and the Vatican declined to comment on Corradi\u2019s arrest. Advocates of sex abuse victims by priests question how Francis could have been unaware of Corradi\u2019s alleged misdeeds, given he was publicly named by the Italian victims starting in 2009 and most recently in 2014. \u201cNo other pope has spoken as passionately about the evil of child sex abuse as Francis. No other pope has invoked \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 as often. No other pope has promised accountability of church superiors,\u201d said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability, an online resource about clerical abuse. \u201cIn light of the crimes against the helpless children in Mendoza, the pope\u2019s assurances seem empty indeed.\u201d On Dec. 11, the pope appeared in a video using sign language to wish deaf people worldwide a Merry Christmas - a gesture that fell particularly flat in Argentina as Catholics struggle with the enormity of the Provolo scandal. \u201cEither he lives outside of reality or this is enormously cynical ... it\u2019s a mockery,\u201d said Carlos Lombardi, an attorney who specializes in canon law. The Provolo case first exploded in Italy in 2009, when the Italian victims went public with stories of abuse after what they said were three useless years of negotiations with the diocese of Verona, where the institute has its Italy headquarters. The 67 victims alleged sexual abuse, pedophilia and corporal punishment at the hands of priests, brothers and lay religious from the 1950s to the 1980s. At the time, 14 of the victims wrote sworn statements and videotaped their testimony detailing the abuse they suffered. They named 24 priests, lay religious and religious brothers in a list that was published online. Corradi was one of those included in the list, which specified he was in Argentina at that time. In 2010, the Vatican ordered the Verona diocese to investigate the claims. One of the victims identified Corradi. The investigation results were sent to the Vatican. In a Nov. 24, 2012 letter, the Verona diocese wrote to the Provolo victims with the results of the Vatican-ordered inquiry and apologized. A copy of the letter provided to the AP listed only five priests accused, four of them sanctioned with a fifth excused because of his age and Alzheimer\u2019s. Some of the original 24 accused had already died, others had left the congregation. For those sanctioned, the Vatican ordered punishments including living a life of prayer and penance and being placed under surveillance away from children. Corradi wasn\u2019t among the five. But the Provolo victims didn\u2019t stop pushing for investigation of other priests. On Dec. 31, 2013, they wrote to the pope asking him to institute an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the charges of clerical sex abuse in Italy. On Oct. 20, 2014, they wrote Francis and the Verona bishop naming 14 priests and lay religious from the institute who were still alive and in ministry who allegedly had sexually abused them. They named Corradi, and noted that he and three others were in Argentina. \u201cWe must point out that the behavior of the church is not in the least bit in line with the \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 stance of Pope Francis,\u201d they wrote, listing the 14 priests and their current locations. \u201cSuch behavior makes us think that the church has no interest in the suffering provoked by priests who sexually abused deaf children, priests who continue to live their lives normally, priests who never apologized to victims, priests who never asked forgiveness and for whom the church itself attempts to let the time pass in hopes that everything is forgotten.\u201d No response was immediately received. More than two years later, the Vatican\u2019s No. 3 official, Monsignor Angelo Becciu, acknowledged receipt of the letters. In a Feb. 5, 2016, response, he said that as far as the Provolo victims\u2019 request for a commission of inquiry was concerned, he had forwarded the proposal to the Italian Bishops\u2019 Conference. Becciu said in that letter that the pope wanted to assure the Provolo victims that the church was taking measures to protect children and prevent sexual abuse. The Italian Bishops\u2019 Conference didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment on whether such a commission was under consideration. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that some hierarchy covered this up. They sent the wolf to take care of the sheep,\u201d said Alejandro Gulle, the chief prosecutor in Mendoza. The Mendoza Archbishopric says it was unaware of the accusations against Corradi. \u201cA religious man comes to a diocese and you trust the legitimate superior,\u201d spokesman Marcelo De Benedectis said. He said that allegations aired by the case have prompted the Mendoza diocese to take measures such as demanding a sworn statement from priests stating that they don\u2019t have a history of violating canon or criminal law. The Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has been informed about the Mendoza accusations, he added. Viviana Avila, who teaches at the school, told the AP that among the professors \u201cnone of us suspected anything,\u201d nor received any complaints from the students. She said the teachers finished classes at midday and never came near the dorms. Unlike the Verona case, the alleged crimes in Mendoza have not expired due to the statute of limitations and could lead to up to 50-year jail sentences for a conviction. A prosecutor is also probing accusations by a man who says he was abused at the Provolo Institute in the city of La Plata when Corradi first arrived in Argentina in the 1980s. \u201cWe want justice to be served. We might be able to get long sentences. I hope they\u2019re the maximum,\u201d said Gulle, the Mendoza prosecutor. \u201cBut we\u2019ll never compensate the spiritual damage suffered by these children.\u201d\u00a0"], "targetTitle": "Argentina investigates alleged sex abuse at school for deaf school", "postTimestamp": "Fri Dec 23 23:50:01 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "rape, provolo institute, vatican, abuse, roman catholic, argentina, sexual abuse, priests", "targetDescription": "Only the children&#039;s tormenters would have heard their cries because the other children at the school were deaf"}

Now I'm 21, but I still wanted to do it. So we're here!", "I feel ya. When my family moved here from Iran, we all but sprinted to Disneyland. I'm still a regular, actually. What is it about the Disney magic that captured our imagination halfway across the world? It started with cartoons. My first memory is -- how do you call it, Mickey Mouse? I was in Latvia when I saw Mickey on TV. And oh, Winnie the Pooh! That's my guy. You want to see them in real life. That's why it's a dream for kids to come here.

It's a small place.", "So what's it like, as a 21-year-old kid from Latvia, being a big star in the Big Apple and arguably the most popular Knick?

No, he never told me that. He said from the beginning to me that he really liked my game, but he didn't really know me. Now he's a big brother, a mentor. He's a really experienced player who knows the details of the game. Whatever I needed, I asked him, and he helped me out.", "You had a solid first year, finishing runner-up for rookie of the year, but your production dipped toward the end of the season. Did you hit the proverbial rookie wall? It's not a real thing. What is it? You have a few bad games, you hit the rookie wall? Late in the season, of course it's going to happen -- you're tired.

I put team success first. And the team goal is to make the playoffs. We don't want to go too far and think we have to make it to the Finals. After the season we had last year, I think the next step is the playoffs. And if your team is winning, you have a bigger possibility of making the All-Star team.", "You're having an All-Star-worthy sophomore campaign. What's the biggest difference between this year and last for you?", "I have one year of experience, so I know the players and teams better. But I'm also trying to have more fun. Sometimes I catch myself putting too much pressure, not enjoying the game. Coaches tell me to just smile a little bit. That reminder is important. When I'm enjoying myself, I play better and I have more swagger.", "Among your peers, who's the guy you measure yourself against, your Magic to his Bird? Hopefully, me and Karl-Anthony Towns can have long, successful careers and a long rivalry. But we're cool. We're friends.", "Who's got the best nickname? Joel [Embiid] gave himself a pretty good one. The Process. That's pretty funny. I like that one.", "Of your 42 million nicknames, which is your personal favorite? I like to keep it simple: KP. The Unicorn is pretty funny, but I don't see people calling me that. \"Yo, Unicorn!\" That won't work. But just don't call me Zinger. Oh my god, I hate that name.", "Everybody loves debating your ceiling. So I'll ask you: what does your ceiling look like?", "I don't like putting limits on myself. It all depends on how much work I put in, but I don't see any limitations for me. I love high-ceilings, remember? [Laughs.]", "There have been obvious comparisons to imports Pau Gasol and Dirk Nowitzki. Among Americans, you've been compared to everyone from Lamar Odom to Kevin Durant. Look ahead five years. Whose game will yours most resemble?", "Maybe I'll gain 100 pounds and play like Shaq. [Laughs.] Obviously, I love Dirk's game. I love Pau, Lamar, KD, all those guys. And, of course, Kobe - I love his killer instinct, mentality and work ethic. But I want to have my own journey, live my own experience. I'm going to be my own player. I'm going to be unique - a unicorn. [Laughs.]", "What career goals have you set for yourself?", "The ultimate goal is to win a ring. And I do have a thought in my head: a quadruple-double in a game -- points, rebounds, assists, blocks. That'd be unbelievable. As I said, I don't want to put limitations on myself. So maybe one day.", "Could you average a triple-double someday? Yeah, for sure. With 10 blocks. Why not?", "Ten blocks per game is crazy. Averaging 10 assists is more realistic, no? For me, 10 blocks is more realistic. I got seven blocks a couple of times. I'm not there yet where I'm dishing the ball out to get 10 assists, but you never know.", "With Christmas upon us, let's imagine Santa appeared and said, \"Kristaps, my boy, you can have one gift for Christmas -- anything in the world.\" What would you ask for? A championship ring.", "And if Santa said, \"Sorry, dude, I don't do miracles\"? [Laughs] Then I'd ask Santa to change my hair on NBA 2K. It's pretty ugly.

When we make donations to worthy causes before the end of the year, it's an all-around win : In addition to keeping more of our own money, we help people who need it most, we sometimes lessen the burden on public coffers, and we can even improve our own health when we give.", " Shutterstock", "But before you become the go-to person with a wallet as wide open as your heart, consider having a strategy so that your donated dollars do the most good. Kay McFarlin, president at TIAA Charitable, says that because we're all different, there's no one size-fits all approach when it comes to giving, and it helps to consult with a financial professional if you're at all confused. It's also important for individuals to hone in on the charities and causes they want to focus on. There are millions of great charities in the United States, which can be a bit overwhelming, she said.", "She also advised looking into Donor Advised Funds (DAFs), sort of like charitable savings accounts, which allow you to write one check that will be distributed to many organizations upon your recommendation while your un-donated money grows. But do your homework before signing up, and make sure the institution you choose is doing what they promise.", "Maria The Money Scientist James, a personal finance expert, agrees that DAFs are a good choice if you're making sizable donations of several thousand dollars or more. It depends on the institution where the person opens the fund, but it will be thousands of dollars. For example Fidelity Charitable requires an initial deposit of $5,000 to start a DAF. However, The T. Rowe Price Program for Charitable Giving requires a minimum initial deposit of $10,000 in order to set up a DAF, she said.", "The DAF will allow you to get the tax breaks immediately as you set aside the planned charitable donation and gives you time to decide on a non-profit, James said. She added that there's another consideration, though, and that's to understand how urgently the nonprofit needs your donation. Even if they are partnered with a DAF, they may not see the money for a while, she said. There isn't a strict time requirement on donating the money so an owner of a DAF could wait a couple years before giving out any donations. Therefore, a non-profit could actually end up with less money as the DAF owners wait to actually distribute the money.", "McFarlin also said to remember the benefits from giving away things other than money. Rather than throwing away furniture, clothes and equipment you aren't using, look into donate them to charity since non-cash gifts might also qualify for tax deductions.

So defer income into next year if you can. Conversely, Trump's plans make paying expenses in 2016 especially attractive if you can deduct them. The deductions may be worth a lot less in 2017. One good example is legal fees. No one likes paying legal fees, but tax deductions can make them a lot less painful. If you pay a 40% tax rate, $10,000 in deductible legal fees costs you only $6,000. But not every legal bill is tax deductible.", "For example, if your legal fees are to get divorced or because a family member sues you for slander, the legal fees are purely personal and non-deductible. Distinguish purely personal expenses from those for investment. The best kind of legal fees are business expenses. They are fully deductible by individuals, corporations, LLCs, and partnerships. Fully deductible means not subject to limitations or alternative minimum tax (AMT). For many individuals not regularly filing as proprietors, even business legal fees are generally treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions. That triggers limitations such as the AMT, a separate 28% tax. To avoid it, some people file a Schedule C, claiming to be a proprietor, but you must actually be in business.", "Contingent lawyer fees can be tricky. Suppose you recover $1 million in a lawsuit and your contingent fee lawyer keeps 40%. You might assume you have $600,000 of income. Actually, you have $1 million of income, and must consider how to deduct the $400,000 of fees. Fortunately, if you hire a contingent fee lawyer in a personal physical injury case (say an auto accident), your entire recovery should be tax-free.", "Watch on Forbes:", "Still, there is great confusion about what is tax-free. Personal physical injury and physical sickness recoveries are tax-free, but punitive damages and interest are taxable. If you receive tax-free and taxable damages (punitive damages and interest are always taxable), you'll need to apportion your attorney's fees.", "Example: You're seriously injured in your car and recover $500,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages from the other driver. Your lawyer gets 40%. Since punitive damages are taxable, half your lawyer's fees are income, and you can probably deduct them only as a miscellaneous itemized deduction.", "In employment cases, a special rule allows you to deduct attorney's fees above-the-line so there's no AMT. A settlement may be wages (subject to withholding) or non-wage income (on an IRS Form 1099). Some business and investment expenses must be capitalized. If you are trying to sell your business and spend $50,000 in legal fees, you must add them to your basis. Ditto if you pay legal fees to resolve a lot line dispute with your neighbor (add the legal fees to your basis in your home). Legal fees for tax advice--income, estate, gift, property, excise or sales and use tax--are deductible no matter what. The fees may involve tax planning or controversies. Even fees for purely personal tax advice qualify.", "Paying deductible items before year-end means you can deduct them now. In 2016, we pay tax on ordinary income tax at graduated rates stretching from 10% to 39.6%. But under Obamacare, high-income taxpayers pay an additional 3.8% surtax on net investment income. That means the top federal rate for individuals is really 43.4%. Qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at 15% or 20%, depending on your income. Yet, that rate too gets hit with the additional 3.8% for Obamacare's net investment income tax.", "President Elect Trump proposed cutting the tax brackets to three: 12%, 25%, and 33%.

The payoff for Exxon was immense: a $500 billion joint venture in 2011 to drill for oil on the Arctic shelf and the Black Sea and another huge deal to develop shale oil deposits in Siberia. Those projects were shelved in 2014, after the West imposed sanctions on Russia for Mr. Putin\u2019s actions in Crimea and Ukraine.", "\u201cThis was a man who was deeply skeptical of Russia, and a person who gave every appearance of being unwilling to commit his firm\u2019s famous reputation for sharp investment decisions and careful financial management to the risks of dealing in an anarchic environment,\u201d said Bernard Sucher, a former Russia director of Merrill Lynch.

Mr. Tillerson can expect to be grilled on how he maintained access to Russia and its vast oil reserves at a time when Washington was trying to isolate Moscow.

They had barely backed out when the owner of Yukos, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, was arrested and his company nationalized. He spent much of the next decade in a Siberian penal colony. Mr. Khodorkovsky blamed his fall on Mr. Sechin, then a relatively unknown presidential aide.", "Mr. Sechin, often described today as the second-most powerful man in Russia, excels at the dark, brutal, high-stakes infighting obscured behind the Kremlin walls, where he comes across as a kind of fearsome enforcer of domestic politics in business.", "Seeing where the power lay, Exxon, like virtually all the other major oil companies, turned to Mr. Sechin for deals, Mr. McFaul said, adding, \u201cThey saddled up with Sechin and put their bets on him.\u201d", "Mr. Sechin\u2019s admiration for Mr. Tillerson helped a lot, said various officials and former oil executives.", "\u201cIn many respects Exxon Mobil and Rex Tillerson himself was the model for what Sechin was trying to do with Rosneft,\u201d Mr. McFaul said.", "Both Mr. Putin and Mr. Sechin initially were suspicious of Exxon.

Russia was in need of advanced technology to develop oil and gas fields in some of the most treacherous conditions on earth. Exxon, a pioneer in Arctic exploration, badly needs foreign fields to maintain production, even after spending tens of billions on exploration and development in recent years. Russia\u2019s Arctic waters hold as much as 190 billion barrels of oil, according to Rosneft\u2019s website.", "But things got off to a rocky start. In 1996, the Russians reluctantly signed three production-sharing agreements, then tried to renegotiate. Shell and Total agreed. Exxon refused despite significant Russian pressure. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s tenacity won a certain grudging respect from the Russians, Mr. Milov said.", "But it was not Mr. Tillerson\u2019s charm, guile and toughness alone that won the day for Exxon. It was also Mr. Sechin. \u201cThey found a partner in the form of Rosneft, and this allowed them to establish a successful partnership,\u201d Mr. Milov said.", "Mr. Putin, by many accounts, came to enjoy the company of corporate chieftains who, like Russia\u2019s domesticated tycoons, learned not to risk their prospects over policy criticism.", "\u201cHe will circle them, beguile them, subordinate them to his desires,\u201d said Nikolai Kovarsky, an adviser to the organizing committee of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. \u201cIf you are a C.E.O., why not pretend you agree, if you can make some money? It\u2019s not moral, but we don\u2019t live in a world of morality.\u201d", "The Exxon charm offensive deepened as the Arctic stakes came into play. Mr. Tillerson invited Mr. Sechin to the United States in April 2012, celebrating him on Wall Street and at the Exxon corporate campus in Texas.", "He had never been to the United States, and he was by all accounts favorably impressed, with the country and with Mr. Tillerson.

Lately I\u2019ve been reading a lot about the ancient world. Initially, I have to admit, I was doing it for entertainment and as a refuge from news that gets worse with each passing day. But I couldn\u2019t help noticing the contemporary resonances of some Roman history \u2014 specifically, the tale of how the Roman Republic fell.", "Here\u2019s what I learned: Republican institutions don\u2019t protect against tyranny when powerful people start defying political norms. And tyranny, when it comes, can flourish even while maintaining a republican facade.", "On the first point: Roman politics involved fierce competition among ambitious men. But for centuries that competition was constrained by some seemingly unbreakable rules. Here\u2019s what Adrian Goldsworthy\u2019s \u201cIn the Name of Rome\u201d says: \u201cHowever important it was for an individual to win fame and add to his and his family\u2019s reputation, this should always be subordinated to the good of the Republic \u2026 no disappointed Roman politician sought the aid of a foreign power.\u201d", "America used to be like that, with prominent senators declaring that we must stop \u201cpartisan politics at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d But now we have a president-elect who openly asked Russia to help smear his opponent, and all indications are that the bulk of his party was and is just fine with that.

Winning domestic political struggles is all that matters, the good of the republic be damned.", "And what happens to the republic as a result? Famously, on paper the transformation of Rome from republic to empire never happened. Officially, imperial Rome was still ruled by a Senate that just happened to defer to the emperor, whose title originally just meant \u201ccommander,\u201d on everything that mattered. We may not go down exactly the same route \u2014 although are we even sure of that? \u2014 but the process of destroying democratic substance while preserving forms is already underway.", "Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.", "Consider what just happened in North Carolina. The voters made a clear choice, electing a Democratic governor. The Republican legislature didn\u2019t openly overturn the result \u2014 not this time, anyway \u2014 but it effectively stripped the governor\u2019s office of power, ensuring that the will of the voters wouldn\u2019t actually matter.", "Combine this sort of thing with continuing efforts to disenfranchise or at least discourage voting by minority groups, and you have the potential making of a de facto one-party state: one that maintains the fiction of democracy, but has rigged the game so that the other side can never win.", "Why is this happening? I\u2019m not asking why white working-class voters support politicians whose policies will hurt them \u2014 I\u2019ll be coming back to that issue in future columns. My question, instead, is why one party\u2019s politicians and officials no longer seem to care about what we used to think were essential American values.

It does have to do with class warfare \u2014 redistribution from the poor and the middle class to the wealthy is a consistent theme of all modern Republican policies. But what directly drives the attack on democracy, I\u2019d argue, is simple careerism on the part of people who are apparatchiks within a system insulated from outside pressures by gerrymandered districts, unshakable partisan loyalty, and lots and lots of plutocratic financial support.", "For such people, toeing the party line and defending the party\u2019s rule are all that matters.

The erosion of democratic foundations has been underway for decades, and there\u2019s no guarantee that we will ever be able to recover.", "But if there is any hope of redemption, it will have to begin with a clear recognition of how bad things are.

Mr. Berman has now turned the third-floor apartment into a clubhouse for teenagers, and the whole second floor into a double-height palace for young children, with seating nooks and lime-green sofas under towering windows. A snaking, pale-wood bookshelf divides the room into cosseting quadrants, scaling it down for pint-size patrons.

Beyer Blinder Belle, the New York architecture firm, performed an act of thoughtful and immaculate preservation. This once-reviled 1960s building, now with its patina of age, is finally coming to be recognized for what it is: a practical Modernist landmark of exceptional finesse and a surprisingly good neighbor.", "The Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center, devised by Diller Scofidio & Renfro (in collaboration with Gensler), is a whimsical 110,000-square-foot exclamation mark on Columbia University\u2019s Upper Manhattan medical campus near the George Washington Bridge. The 14-story tower\u2019s camera-ready face looks south. It presents a cheerfully teetering stack of cantilevered terraces, indoor bleacher seats, lounges and stairs. They spill toward a handsome wood-lined amphitheater linked by steps to the sloping sidewalk. One can picture a giant pinball bouncing from the top of Vagelos and rolling down Haven Avenue.", "The architects call this sunny, wide-open south side the \u201cstudy cascade.\u201d Offices and classrooms fill the more conventional north half of the tower, which is clad in a fritted milky curtain wall that\u2019s less striking outside but mitigates solar heat gain. State-of-the-art anatomy classrooms tucked behind the cascade are part of a deceptively pragmatic layout. A restrained palette \u2014 of white, orange and Douglas fir panels stained a burnt sienna \u2014 balances the sculptural gymnastics. The other day I found students poring over their laptops in the ground-floor lounge. Some grumbled a little about minor early-days stuff like not enough electrical outlets, but they all said they loved the architecture. I do, too. It\u2019s what medical schools generally aren\u2019t: playful, welcoming, warm. And when the sun sets, the center becomes a beacon in the neighborhood.", "Farther south, Columbia\u2019s 17-acre Manhattanville campus began to take shape this fall with the construction of an arts hub and completion of the Jerome L. Greene Science Center, an urbane glass-and-steel behemoth by Renzo Piano rising beside the aged No. 1 subway viaduct, near the intersection of Broadway and 125th Street.", "The building is a nine-story, 450,000-square-foot nexus for neuroscience. Four steel-frame glass blocks surround a glassy core with meeting rooms. The basic shape is nothing pyrotechnic, but, as usual with Mr. Piano, the nub is in the details and in the light. A double-skin curtain wall, the two layers separated by a muffling pillow of air, lets light flood in while reducing the rumble of the elevated subway. I write these words inside another of Mr. Piano\u2019s buildings, staring from a glass cubicle through several more layers of glass across a birch-filled courtyard. My colleagues across the court look almost immaterial. The Greene Center engineers even greater illusions of ethereal weightlessness, the layered glass membranes held in equilibrium by a clockwork of steel beams and cables, tinted powder blue. Like church spires, tall twin smokestacks announce the campus from afar, declaring the center a factory for ideas.", "The industrial nostalgia recalls Mr. Piano\u2019s ship-shaped new Whitney Museum and is clearly meant to substitute midcentury symbols of modern commerce for the usual classic emblems of institutional authority. A plaza stands in for the ancient agora. The center will anchor one side of the evolving Manhattanville project, with its multidisciplinary aspirations, underground passageways for Columbia people and variety of street-level public spaces. These are intended partly to appease angry former residents of the neighborhood troubled by Columbia\u2019s gentrifying expansion, and also to signal that the university is opening itself up. Mr. Piano envisions a kind of Italian piazza, democratic and energized. We\u2019ll see how further development follows through on that promise.", "Several weekends this summer, I hopped the ferry with the family for Governors Island. Back in 2003, the federal government sold the island to the city, which got a derelict former military base that included some lovely historic officers\u2019 homes. Leslie Koch was hired in 2006 as president of the Trust for Governors Island. She enlisted Adriaan Geuze of West 8, the landscape architecture firm. Ms. Koch and her team spent years just watching how people used the island, seeing what was wanted. They responded with food carts, mini-golf, Adirondack chairs, bike shares, children\u2019s programs and art projects.", "The last, most ambitious phase of redevelopment was completed this summer: man-made hills (cost: $71 million, half public, half private money). A hill with twisty slides for kids became an instant sensation; another features a sculpture by Rachel Whiteread. The tallest has a killer view of the Statue of Liberty and much of the skyline.", "Mr. Geuze\u2019s design for the island established a high-water mark for resilient planning, taking into account not just sea rise and storm surges but also social cohesion. Watch the mix of parents and children around the slides, sprinklers and food carts on a warm summer Saturday afternoon. Governors Island is New York as a diverse and joyful city. Mr. Geuze and Ms. Koch, who stepped down this year, deserve medals. Now City Hall has to find tenants to help pay for the island\u2019s upkeep. Big office or apartment towers would undo much of what has been accomplished. Here\u2019s hoping that some venturesome, well-endowed university or cultural institution is seeking a beautiful home.", "Most rental apartment towers end up vanilla-brick or glass nonentities, invisible at best. Not Via 57 West. No building redrew the city\u2019s western skyline more ingeniously than Bjarke Ingels\u2019s first completed project in New York: a warped, mountainous pyramid hugging the Hudson River at 57th Street. Already filmmakers have exploited it in \u201cDoctor Strange.\u201d", "The shape is not a pyramid, actually, but a hyperbolic paraboloid, rectangular on the ground, with a swooping roof-facade, a bit like the billowed sail of a ship, sweeping upward from 12th Avenue to the mast\u2019s peak at the northeast corner of the site, 467 feet high. Looking from 11th Avenue and 58th Street, the 32-story building resembles a spire. From elsewhere, it unfurls, its saw-toothed balconies, angled toward the Hudson, making hundreds of facets in the stainless-steel skin, which shimmer with the changing light.", "This is a building very much designed outside in, notwithstanding that the Danish Mr. Ingels has trumpeted the nice \u201cScandimerican\u201d stylings of the lounges and handsome oak-and-brick lobby and the community-enhancing function of the landscaped private courtyard at Via 57, which recalls his design for the 8 House in Copenhagen. Sliced from the center of the building, the courtyard leads to riverfront terraces with outdoor grills and a host of indoor amenities. I\u2019ll be curious to know how much this fosters community. The amenities require a fee. Twenty percent of the 709 apartments are set aside for subsidized tenants, in return for which the developer enjoyed the usual tax breaks. Otherwise, Via 57 seems to market itself toward brokers and Westchester doctors who can pay top dollar for the light but sometimes cramped apartments off double-loaded corridors, a hike from the nearest subway.", "Of course, tenants are also paying for the pleasure and cachet of living in a striking work of architecture. New York\u2019s former planning commissioner Amanda Burden deserves a shout-out here for pushing Douglas Durst, the developer, and Mr. Ingels to cook up something bold at such a conspicuous site. The three of them have given the city a new spectacle.", "O.K., I get one Grinch moment, not about the $4 billion shopping mall attached to a PATH station at ground zero or the election of a president who, among other things, believes privatization is the answer to what ails the nation\u2019s infrastructure.", "No, I want to grouse about one of the sadder excuses for architecture completed this year. You can nominate your own candidate. This one is a kind of sleeper, at Mulry Square, at the intersection of Greenwich and Seventh Avenues, in Greenwich Village. There the Metropolitan Transportation Authority finished building a $180 million emergency ventilation plant. The site is opposite the new St. Vincent\u2019s Triangle Park and AIDS Memorial. Once upon a time, this is where I stood guard as a fourth-grade street-crossing monitor from P.S. 41, the school up the block, until my boss and classmate Trippy West suspended me for reporting late at the end of a lunch period. But I digress.", "Neighborhood groups, along with the city\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Commission, acknowledging the necessity for a \u201cfan plant,\u201d pleaded for years with the authority for a design less hideous than a windowless concrete bunker and a few forlorn benches. Transit officials paid no attention. With a chain-link fence around the base and part of a fake-brick townhouse facade, topped by a curtain-rod cornice, the facility seems an intentional slap in the face of every New Yorker who hoped for a structure that, if not actually good, might at least be innocuous.", "It\u2019s also a reminder that infrastructure projects like this were once occasions for civic-minded expressions of architectural ambition. Walk just a few blocks from Mulry Square to the three-story Metropolitan Transportation Authority substation at Greenwich Avenue and 13th Street, built during the early 1930s. Its geometric decorations, embossed aluminum doors, limestone frieze, Flemish brick coursing and square turrets make it one of New York\u2019s Art Deco gems and a neighborhood landmark.", "The contrast between the bunker and the substation can make you weep.

That flow of air then can push objects out of the windpipe and prevent suffocation.", "Much of Heimlich's 2014 autobiography focuses on the maneuver, which involves thrusts to the abdomen that apply upward pressure on the diaphragm to create an air flow that forces food or other objects out of the windpipe.", "The Cincinnati chest surgeon told The Associated Press in a February 2014 interview that thousands of deaths reported annually from choking prompted him in 1972 to seek a solution. During the next two years, he led a team of researchers at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati. He successfully tested the technique by putting a tube with a balloon at one end down an anesthetized dog's airway until it choked. He then used the maneuver to force the dog to expel the obstruction.", "The Wilmington, Delaware, native estimated the maneuver has saved the lives of thousands of choking victims in the United States alone. It earned him several awards and worldwide recognition. His name became a household word.", "The maneuver was adopted by public health authorities, airlines and restaurant associations, and Heimlich appeared on shows including the \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and \"The Today Show.\"", "His views on how the maneuver should be used and on other innovations he created or proposed put him at odds with some in the health field. He said his memoir was an effort to preserve his technique.", "\"I know the maneuver saves lives, and I want it to be used and remembered,\" he told the AP. \"I felt I had to have it down in print so the public will have the correct information.\"", "The maneuver has continued to make headlines. Clint Eastwood was attending a golf event in Monterey, California, in 2014 when the then-83-year-old actor saw the tournament director choking on a piece of cheese and successfully performed the technique.", "\"The best thing about it is that it allows anyone to save a life,\" Heimlich told the AP.", "In 2016, Heimlich himself was the hero, saving a woman choking on food at his senior living center.", "Heimlich said the maneuver is very effective when used correctly, but he did not approve of American Red Cross guidelines calling for back blows followed by abdominal thrusts in choking cases that don't involve infants or unconscious victims. Red Cross officials said evidence shows using multiple methods can be more effective, but Heimlich said blows can drive obstructions deeper into a windpipe. The American Heart Association backs abdominal thrusts.", "Neither organization supports Heimlich's view that using the maneuver to remove water from the lungs could save drowning victims. They recommend CPR.", "Heimlich was proud of some of his other innovations, such as a chest drain valve credited by some with saving soldiers and civilians during the Vietnam War. But he drew sharp criticism for his theory that injecting patients with a curable form of malaria could trigger immunity in patients with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Medical experts have said injecting patients with malaria would be dangerous and have criticized Heimlich for conducting studies involving malariotherapy on HIV patients in China.", "Heimlich mostly brushed off critics.", "\"I'll be the first to admit that a number of my ideas are controversial and in some ways unorthodox,\" Heimlich told the AP. \"But I have enough guts to know that when I am right, it will come about as the thing to do, even if others do the wrong thing for a time.\"", "One of his most vocal critics has been his son, Peter Heimlich. The younger Heimlich split with his father years ago over a personal rift.

Their new colleagues would \u201cjust stare in wide-eyed amazement at some of our moves, what we did in practice, how we played within a team\u201d. Both players were drifting towards the end of their playing careers, but they were still vastly superior to all their team-mates.", "Which is probably what you would expect given that China\u2019s solitary appearance in a World Cup came in 2002, losing all three games without scoring a single goal, and we are talking about the nation that is 83rd in Fifa\u2019s latest world rankings, directly below Antigua and Barbuda and one above the Faroe Islands, whose combined population could fit into any Shanghai suburb with room to spare.", "It is certainly easy to understand why, after Graziano Pell\u00e8 signed for Shandong Luneng, one football magazine carried a spoof interview from the Italian expressing his joy to be joining \u201cwhat I presume to be a football club in China or thereabouts\u201d. Pell\u00e8 will apparently earn \u00a334m in two and a half years, which breaks down to \u00a3260,000 a week, reputedly putting him in the top five best-paid footballers in the world, while leaving the firm impression that whoever runs Shandong hadn\u2019t noticed the second L in his surname.", "Remember when Juninho joined Middlesbrough back in the 1990s in one of those transfers that seemed to shape English football? \u201cJuninho will need to learn only three words of English: pound, thank you and bye\u2011bye,\u201d Jan Aage Fjortoft, one of his new team-mates, said at the time. It is the same now in China and it did raise a smile when Ramires, on his way out of Chelsea earlier this year, insisted the huge financial incentives had not underpinned his transfer to the Chinese Super League. No, presumably every young boy from Rio de Janeiro grows up dreaming of playing for Jiangsu Suning, in the nation that has just lost a World Cup qualifier at home to Syria \u2013 a country, you might imagine, that has other things on its mind than putting out a football team.", "Oscar, an increasingly peripheral figure at Chelsea, is the latest to be tempted and, however much his impending \u00a360m transfer to Shanghai SIPG is dressed up, it is difficult not to think it deeply unsatisfying to see someone of his age abandoning any real sense of ambition and, without wishing to be too cruel, a certain amount of respectability. At 25, he is approaching what should be the greatest years of his career, even if it seems apparent they will not be with his current club. He is also exceedingly rich already, most people would assume, after four and a half years on Chelsea\u2019s payroll, and surely talented enough to attract potential buyers from Europe\u2019s top leagues. Good luck to him, I suppose, but however many noughts are added to his salary, I do wonder how much job satisfaction there can be for a footballer with his gifts at a level several rungs down even from Major League Soccer.", "If that sounds slightly harsh, the reality is we are probably just going to have to get used to players heading that way, judging by the mind-boggling amounts on offer, and presumably it won\u2019t be too long before a high\u2011profile English footballer is added to the number.", "Wayne Rooney has already had one offer and, though it didn\u2019t get very far at all, he hasn\u2019t completely ruled out the idea of China even if, money aside, he hasn\u2019t heard too much that is appealing. Rooney\u2019s advisers went on a fact\u2011finding mission to China last spring and reported back that the pitches were appalling, the standard as bad as everyone thought, and the referees even worse, in a league blackened by tales of match-fixing and bribery.", "Rooney might also remember Manchester United\u2019s pre-season friendly against FC Shenzhen in Macau in 2007 and what came out, four years later, about the referee taking 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (roughly \u00a38,000) to fix the coin toss. Yet the key detail is what a climb-down it would be, football-wise, for someone whose career has been spent at the high end of the Premier League. The money is sensational but, to remember the old Rodriguez song, a monkey in silk is still a monkey.", "The difference between Rooney and Oscar is that one is skidding towards the end of a rapidly decelerating career whereas the other should be five or six years away from the point where he might be thinking about one last payday. That is the shame of it all, why Jamie Carragher has called it embarrassing and why, unless there is a late change of heart, it feels like such a waste that a super-rich footballer would follow the yuan rather than stay in Europe and play in the competitions that really matter to the people in his profession.", "Yaya Tour\u00e9 is often accused of being driven by ego and money \u2013 mostly, it ought to be said, because of a particularly dislikable agent, rather than the player himself \u2013 but it is not widely known the Manchester City midfielder turned his back on one offer from China last summer that would have earned him, after tax, \u00a3360,000 per week. Tour\u00e9 simply decided he was already an extremely wealthy man, that he would earn huge wages anyway and that, at the age of 33, he still wanted to be involved in a competitive league rather than one where its star imports counted their dosh but, in sporting terms, found little satisfaction.", "Rio Ferdinand was the same when he left Manchester United and had money-spinning offers from teams in China, the Gulf and the United States. He opted for QPR and hopefully Alexis S\u00e1nchez will also decide that life in London is preferable for a category-A footballer now he is a target of China. S\u00e1nchez could feasibly earn \u00a3400,000 a week but it would be disappointing, in the extreme, if it turns out we have misjudged him and he decides the higher salary would be better for him, career-wise, than earning millions with Arsenal instead.", "To give him his due, there is nothing to suggest that is the case, but not everyone thinks the same, plainly. Alex Teixiera could have moved to Liverpool before pitching up at Jiangsu Suning. Gervinho, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Demba Ba, Papiss Ciss\u00e9, Jackson Mart\u00ednez and Hulk all now play in the country where Paul Gascoigne once had a two-week trial at one club \u2013 \u201cThe name escapes me now,\u201d he wrote, rather brilliantly, in his autobiography \u2013 and a brief spell at Gansu Tianma.", "In Oscar\u2019s case, he has clearly been shunted to the edges at Chelsea since Antonio Conte took control, and the natural comeback in these kind of debates is to ask how many people in any walk of life would say no to trebling their wages \u2013 for the Brazilian, increasing his salary to \u00a3350,000 a week.", "All the same, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger made a good point recently, discussing Arsenal\u2019s contract negotiations with Sanchez, when he said the Premier League\u2019s top players were hardly on a pittance anyway and needed to be careful about getting their priorities in the wrong order. \u201cI believe personally, and maybe I am a bit naive, that it\u2019s more about getting to meet the player\u2019s needs \u2026 the way the club has values, the way the club has ambition, the way the club respects the players,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThe money is good everywhere for everybody.\u201d", "Maybe I am a bit naive, too, but I cannot help agree. Oscar is too good for China. It is no place for any footballer with genuine ambition and surely, if he has to leave Chelsea, he could find another club that allows him to be a multimillionaire, with everything done for him and all the superstar\u2019s accessories, in a country where the sport is not a national embarrassment.", "China\u2019s defeat to Syria in October finished with swarms of people protesting on the streets, just as they did in 2013 after the national team lost 5-1 against a Thai youth side and their Spanish coach, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho, resigned in disgrace. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has made it clear he wants to start the country\u2019s rise as a football power, meaning the sport is now a compulsory part of the national curriculum and tens of thousands of new pitches are being created, but it will take many years before they catch up. The wages are out of this world but they probably have to be because any top-level player heading to China might just find this is the point when the rest of football stops taking their careers seriously.", "Greg Clarke, chairman of the Football Association, did not make any attempt to downplay the seriousness of the child sexual-abuse scandal and the potential repercussions for the relevant clubs and, indeed, his own organisation. Everybody at the FA knew the importance of getting this one right, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the biggest crisis I can remember and we\u2019re trying to be completely transparent.\u201d", "Clarke was formerly the chairman of the Football League and you might remember him promising transparency back then, too. \u201cI have a propensity to think that transparency is a wonderful thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you see countries and companies who are not transparent, terrible things happen.\u201d", "Absolutely. And now here he was again, in his new role, promising everything would be out in the open and the FA, conducting its own inquiry, would keep us all in touch. \u201cWe will bring information to the public domain as quickly as possible,\u201d he added, reassuringly.", "Except this was 29 November and, as we know now, four days earlier the FA suspended Dario Gradi, director of football at Crewe Alexandra, from all football-related activities. Clarke, promising transparency and an open line of information, had stood in front of the television cameras and somehow failed to mention it once.", "On 6 December I wrote that the FA intended to interview Gradi about what he knew and, before and after publication, had several conversations with the governing body. Again, no mention was made that Gradi, by that stage, was 11 days into his suspension. In fact, the FA still hasn\u2019t uttered a word on the subject \u2013 not even a one-line confirmation \u2013 despite it being reported everywhere and even though Crewe, possibly the least transparent club I have ever dealt with, have put out a brief statement.", "Is this the FA\u2019s idea of transparency? It feels more like a deliberate attempt to hush everything up, which is precisely what the FA promised it would not do. Perhaps Clarke thought nobody would notice when Gradi stopped turning up for matches but more fool us, I suppose, if we were daft enough to believe the FA might actually mean it this time.", "For the time being, it feels about as transparent as a pint of Guinness and, on a similar theme, it would be appreciated if the FA could be good enough to explain what a suspension from all football\u2011related activities actually entails.

We haven\u2019t done anything to make Europe stand up and take note.", "Our history of brittleness in the knockout stages means it\u2019s hard for Arsenal supporters to be excited about this one \u2013 no matter how well the group stage went. We did what we had to do against PSG home and away but nothing more. Keeping it tight in the Allianz Arena is the key. I\u2019d be more than happy with a draw from the first leg. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s Bayern Munich side seem to be more fragile a team than they have been over the last five years, so progression isn\u2019t beyond this Arsenal team. Cian Mulligan", "To top Group D in front of Bayern Munich was outstanding. The tight 1-0 wins over PSV, Bayern and FC Rostov, where our defensive qualities and clinical finishing shone through when it mattered, laid the foundation and, by the time we lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich in the last game of the group stage, it didn\u2019t really matter.", "The team needs to remain injury free. The golden quartet of Antoine Griezmann, Yannick Carrasco, K\u00e9vin Gameiro and Fernando Torres need to find the form they showed earlier in the season. They\u2019ve looked a bit off the pace in recent La Liga games.", "Atl\u00e9tico can easily reach the quarter-finals and quite possibly the semis. In the past five years under Diego Simone we have been nothing short of spectacular. Teams across Europe now fear having to play us. Simeone has turned an average side into a world-class powerhouse. Hopefully our European success can continue for a few more rounds at least. Pete", "We have performed as well as we should have considering the quality of the opposition in Group C. Celtic and Borussia Monchengladbach weren\u2019t teams to be feared, and our one setback in Manchester occurred without Gerard Piqu\u00e9, Jordi Alba and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. The irony is that Manchester City arguably have the easier of our last 16 draws facing Monaco. Paris Saint-Germain was only one of a few teams I was most hoping to avoid.", "The most important factor is the fitness and availability of Barcelona\u2019s key players. Without Lionel Messi, Iniesta, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Piqu\u00e9, the task of beating the French champions becomes a lot more difficult. If PSG create a new identity under Unai Emery, they have the quality to exploit Barcelona\u2019s weaknesses if we don\u2019t have those players available.", "If Barcelona don\u2019t make the semi-finals I\u2019ll be disappointed, but the quality of the opposition means that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we went out early because of bad luck or an injury crisis. Aidan", "Having gone six games unbeaten in Group E, we were perhaps a little unfortunate to only go through as runners-up. But the two draws against CSKA Moscow proved costly, and doubly so after we beat Monaco convincingly 3-0 in the last group game. But if we\u2019d won the group we would have drawn Manchester City, so I\u2019m not sure if that is much better than having to face Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.", "I\u2019m very pleased to have qualified from a group where it looked like all four teams had ambitions to progress. Our overall away performance and 1-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur was clinical and made us believe we could go through. Wembley seemed to just swallow them up!", "If our Champions League adventure ends in the last 16, then so be it. We\u2019ve had a good run. But it\u2019s not certain that we\u2019ll bow out, we\u2019re capable of giving Atl\u00e9tico tight games. But we need to travel to Spain for the second leg with a substantial advantage. I don\u2019t fancy our chances if we need to chase the game at the Vicente Calderon. Adrian", "We\u2019ve done OK. Our shock defeat in Russia to FC Rostov was a blow, but beating Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at home in the last group game was good for confidence at least. Finishing second wasn\u2019t so bad as we have a good record against Arsenal.", "A good result in the first leg at home is vital and a clean sheet will go a long way in securing our progress to the quarter-finals. We haven\u2019t lost at home in the Champions League for 15 matches now so we\u2019re confident of having a significant advantage before the return leg in London. We haven\u2019t peaked yet, so I still think we have a good chance of winning the Champions League this year.", "Bayern can win anywhere. Carlo Ancelotti has changed his formation recently and that suits the team much better. Come February this team will be a well oiled machine. The four-week winter break also means Bayern players have time to recover, while watching Arsenal go through a very busy schedule. Daniel Schaefers", "We were absolutely excellent in the group stage. You can\u2019t go wrong with 21 goals scored in six games, with 14 different goalscorers contributing. It was a joy to watch and a wonderful team effort. The irresistible, fluid play and tough mentality shown when coming from behind in the two Real Madrid encounters, which both ended 2-2, stand out.", "Going forward we must not lose sight of our defensive stability and balance, but our extremely young team has already demonstrated they can keep their cool under pressure. And with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leading the line we will always find opportunities to score.", "I would say we are 70/30 favourites against Benfica. If we progress further it will depend on the draw, but we know we can hurt anyone on our day. I would love to say we are going all the way, but I think we are conceding too many goals for that and maybe our team is a little bit unexperienced at this level. Stefan", "We didn\u2019t do as well as we had expected, but considering the amount of injuries we\u2019ve suffered this season we have to be happy with still being in the competition. We lost two points in each of the games against Besiktas that were ours for the taking. In the end we got lucky with Dynamo Kiev\u2019s victory against Besiktas.", "We\u2019ll have to be very good to hold Borussia Dortmund\u2019s incredible attacking firepower at bay, and also be very effective on the counter-attack. We have to be brave enough to press their defence at the right times. With key players like Jonas, Jardel and Grimaldo coming back from injury, I think we have a 1/3 chance of reaching the next round. The odds are against us and it might be a challenge too far this year. Antonio Oliveira", "Juventus have been there or thereabouts for the past three seasons and it was especially galling to watch Kingsley Coman come on and help knock us out last year. Add in the departure of Paul Pogba and you\u2019d think things would be difficult, but there\u2019s a renewed vigour around the team as evidenced by the unbeaten group stage.", "Porto represent a tough but winnable challenge; we should have too much for them over the two legs. I\u2019d like to see more goals from Miralem Pjanic; he can score and needs to show it more, but otherwise he\u2019s been a solid acquisition. I\u2019d also like to see the rest of the team chipping in a bit more; Higuain is world class, but nobody else has reached double figures yet. We have to alter that between now and the round of 16.", "We also have some notable records that are nice to see. Moise Keane becoming the first player born in the 21st century to play in the Champions League was lovely, and if we can make it to the final, it will be Evra\u2019s sixth, which I believe is a clear record. I expect Barcelona, Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Sevilla to join us in the quarter-finals, and I would welcome any of them. LeftPegger", "We had a relatively easy group stage but it was annoying to hear fans and pundits saying we were \u201clucky\u201d. Sorry, but we earned that group as English champions and consequently a place as one of the eight group seeds. Despite the 5-0 drubbing against Porto in the last game, where Claudio Ranieri put out a much weakened team, we have a chance over two legs against Sevilla \u2013 especially if they set up to attack us on the basis of that anomalous result.", "We need to stick to what we\u2019re good at: soaking up the pressure and hitting teams on the break. Once we were crowned champions there was perhaps a different mindset for the players this season - that we now had to play like champions and tippy-tappy our way to victory. We need to utilise our strengths, our overlapping full-backs and wingers (Christian Fuchs and Marc Albrighton on the left, Danny Simpson and Rihad Mahrez on the right) and Danny Drinkwater in the centre of the park. They can all be devastating if we win the ball on the edge of our area. A dash forward for Jamie Vardy and Islam Slimani and either a beautifully weighted cross or a threaded through ball will see us home.", "I\u2019m under no illusions that we\u2019ll win the competition but, being at home for the second leg of the last 16 against a good but not great side, I think we can make the quarter-finals. At that point it will entirely depend on the draw. If we get Real Madrid, Barcelona or PSG, who I expect to win their ties, we have little chance over two legs. But if we\u2019re lucky enough to get the winners of Benfica v Borussia Dortmund, then an unlikely place in the semi-finals is not out of the question \u2013 and our European tour can extend into the spring! Ben Smith", "The Barcelona game was City\u2019s best night in Europe since the takeover, but overall the group stage was a mixed bag. The games against Celtic and the away performance against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach were hugely underwhelming.", "We need to find a defensive structure that doesn\u2019t repeatedly offer chances to our opposition. Aside from the Barcelona game at home, we have presented our opponents with far too many chances. In the knockout stages these errors will be heavily punished. Hopefully Pep Guardiola will have decided upon a settled formation and line-up by the time the business end of the season kicks off.", "Despite our recent struggles, I still think City can be a match for any team, especially if our defensive issues can be resolved. The semi-finals beckon if we can iron out the mistakes at the back. Hawkhurst", "We\u2019ve played well so far and deserved to go through as Group E winners. It was nice to teach Tottenham a thing or two about the Champions League. Even if we crashed out of the competition now, at least we\u2019ll always have Kamil Glik\u2019s screamer against Bayer Leverkusen!", "Manchester City will be a tall order for us. Once occupying the same super-rich stratum as their English opponents, Monaco have changed tack in recent years and promoted youth talent while cutting back on the spending. The result of this is a distinct lack of galacticos lining up for us in comparison to Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. Radamel Falcao needs to turn up, as does Joao Moutinho; lesser-known squad players such as Mathieu Kowalewski and Patrice Boivin will probably be key, once the inevitable injuries hit. Good luck Jemerson trying to keep Sergio Ag\u00fcero quiet for 180 minutes.", "There\u2019s a saying among Monaco fans: \u201cOur club promises nothing and delivers less.\u201d I don\u2019t have high hopes, but perhaps that\u2019s just the pessimistic nature of our fans. We never really got over that loss in the final to Porto in 2004. Sadly, I think City will get the better of us over two legs. But we\u2019re not the favourites, so with the pressure off \u2013 who knows? Woolie Madden", "Our two previous Champions League appearances both ended cruelly, so having progressed from Group B as winners we were hoping for third time lucky. However, drawing Real Madrid in the first knockout stage wasn\u2019t part of the masterplan.", "We will be hoping for a low-scoring match and a precious away goal at the Bernab\u00e9u then the atmosphere at the Stadio San Paolo will take care of the return leg. Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Arsenal and Borrussia Dortmund have all failed to win there in recent years.", "I\u2019m keeping everything crossed for a huge upset and a place in the quarter-finals. If Trump can win the US Presidency, then anything is possible, right? Napoli will upset Real Madrid \u2013 you heard it here first. Nestor Nicolas", "PSG is clearly a club in transition. We produce some good football, like against Arsenal, where we deserved better results, but the performances against Basel and Ludogorets were clearly not good enough. Those disappointments might still cost us dearly. Key players are struggling; Lucas Moura keeps missing chances, Hatem Ben Arfa does not pass the ball enough, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda still hasn\u2019t played a good game this year. On top of that manager Unai Emery counted on Javier Pastore to be the go-to offensive midfielder and game-changer this year but he\u2019s been injured for most of the last 12 months.", "The best way to beat Barcelona would be to play a pressing game. PSG will not have the ball very much so it\u2019s important to be very effective on the counter. Players need to step up. And Messi might have a couple of bad nights, you never know. Alex", "Porto has the youngest squad in the Champions League. This and a new manager meant a slow start. The home draw to Copenhagen was a nadir: a team adrift and bereft of ideas. But once Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo finally settled on a system and the younger players became more confident in their roles, the team developed. The 5-0 trouncing of Leicester is deceptive, as the Foxes were playing a second-string team. But it was a great way to end the group stage.", "At least we didn\u2019t draw an English team; Porto have a terrible record in England. But we\u2019ll have a tough enough time containing Juventus\u2019s stellar forwards. But the real key will be how the squad performs in the first game at home. Can this very young squad hold its nerve against the Italian champions? We need a positive result going into the return leg in Turin that\u2019s for sure.", "Realistically, the round of 16 is probably as good as it will get this season. The team is very talented but also very, very young. Porto are the only club to have won the Champions League in the last 20 years from outside of the big four countries (Spain, Italy, Germany and England). And the odds of winning it this season, low as they are, would certainly be higher than in 1987, when we took our first European title by beating Bayern Munich in Vienna. You just never know. Alan Gomes", "We should have won the group. There\u2019s no doubt about that. Borussia Dortmund played some wonderful attacking football, but we should have beaten them on both occasions. They found our weak spots defensively, but we went through the group stage unbeaten and hopefully we can keep that run going into the knockout stages.", "We shouldn\u2019t feel too down about the draw. With Bayern Munich also finishing second in their group it\u2019s clear that the big guns are saving their very best for the knockout stages. Napoli will be a tough nut to crack in Naples, but by then we should have a significant advantage from the first leg in the Bernab\u00e9u to encourage us to push on. Defensively we need to be focused though. \u201cWe\u2019ll score one more than you\u201d is an even more dangerous tactic with the away goals rule lurking in the background. I thought that we had a chance of retaining the Champions League trophy this season and I stand by that. We just need a bit of fine tuning. Augustin", "We\u2019ve had an excellent season so far both domestically and in Europe. Our pressing game has been very impressive and the work ethic is admirable. To only be one point behind Barcelona in La Liga so close to Christmas is a great achievement, but we need to continue our fine form into the New Year.", "We shouldn\u2019t underestimate Leicester. It\u2019s clear that they sacrificed their league form for a good run in the Champions League. I fully expect them to pick up in the Premier League now and grow in confidence before the round of 16 ties. But we have nothing to fear either. Jorge Sampaoli has created a competent side and has installed a new self-esteem and self-confidence in his players. This is not a competition that allows you to get distracted though, and although I expect us to go through to the quarter-finals we need to make sure we don\u2019t fall to the underdog.

Glenn Jr.\u2019s historic orbit around the Earth possible.\u00a0", "The film focuses on characters who often get overlooked in the movies \u2014 not heroic, larger-than-life figures like\u00a0Glenn, but the brilliant minds working behind the scenes.\u00a0", "Acting as a sort of human computer, African-American mathematician Katherine Johnson made many of NASA's first missions possible.", "The story centers on Katherine Johnson, a so-called NASA \u201ccomputer\u201d whose expertise in analytic geometry led her be asked to verify the calculations of the then-newfangled IBM mainframes that laid the groundwork for launching rockets into space. Johnson, now 98 years old, was honored with the\u00a0Presidential Medal of Freedom\u00a0in 2015 for her pioneering role in the space program starting in the 1950s.", "\u201cGrowing up, my dad was a NASA Langley scientist \u2014 he worked with these women, I knew these women. They were in the community, they were normal. They were just \u2018Mrs. Johnson\u2019 to me and went about their normal lives,\u201d Margot Lee Shetterly, author of\u00a0\u201cHidden Figures,\u201d the nonfiction book the film is based on, told CBS News at the premiere.\u00a0", "\u201cThey were very modest people and had multiple facets of their lives. These were moms who went to church, were Girl Scout leaders, went to the grocery store. But then they had this other part of them at NASA. It was great growing up to see these NASA engineers, these scientists, who were black. Who were women. It had nothing to do with the \u2018white male, whatever.\u2019 It showed me that all these people could be scientists, they could all achieve their dreams. It was a great way to grow up.\u201d", "For Shetterly, the path from book to film was unusual. The book \u2014 her first \u2014 was optioned to be made into a movie even before it was published.\u00a0", "Growing up surrounded by NASA scientists, the story was personal to Shetterly. Screenwriter Allison Schroeder, who wrote the film script along with producer-screenwriter Theodore Melfie, felt that it was crucial to capture this specific slice of NASA history accurately.\u00a0", "\u201cI had a big responsibility not just telling this story, but getting it right. Katherine Johnson\u2019s request was not for her but all the women who worked at NASA be represented. She didn\u2019t want this to be just about one person \u2014 not just one. There are a lot of forgotten, untold stories,\u201d she told CBS News. \u201cI have to say this came together pretty organically because the truth was better than any fiction I could have come up with.\u201d", "Looming large over the premiere was the recent passing of John Glenn, who died Dec. 8 at the age of 95. While his role in history makes him a prominent figure in the film, he isn\u2019t the focal point; that is reserved for Johnson (Henson) and her colleagues and friends Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon\u00e1e).\u00a0", "The filmmakers emphasized at the premiere that these women\u2019s contributions were so inextricably tied to Glenn\u2019s achievements that essentially, the legend surrounding Glenn can\u2019t be examined without shining a spotlight on these \u201chidden figures.\u201d\u00a0", "Shetterly said that Glenn\u2019s loss makes the release of the film particularly poignant.\u00a0", "John Glenn, who died last week at the age of 95, was, for an entire generation, the embodiment of the American hero.

He recognized Katherine Johnson at a time when she was not what a scientist or mathematician necessarily looked like,\u201d Shetterly said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fitting and poignant time for him to leave the stage while we are celebrating his legacy.\u201d", "NASA astronaut and flight surgeon Dr. Yvonne Cagle, a trailblazer herself, said she was particularly moved. She knew Glenn well and cites him as an influence who helped shape her career.", "\u201cJohn Glenn, in particular, he not only was bold enough to orbit the Earth, but brave enough to return to space in 1997 when I was starting to train with him at the shuttle mission, to assist the team in training with him,\u201d she told CBS News. \u201cI\u2019ll always remember how graciously he broke away from a huge group of inspiring seasoned astronauts to graciously take my hand in introducing himself to say, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m John Glenn.\u2019 And it\u2019s this moment, like so many of these others, that make his spirit live forever in our hearts.\u201d", "(Clip 2) The gracious, ever-classy Dr. Yvonne Cagle, @nasa astronaut, on the passing of John Glenn. #hiddenfigures #moviepremiere #nasa #johnglenn #sciencenews #space #astronaut #nyc #chelsea #chelseanyc", "A video posted by Brian Mastroianni (@bmastroianni) on Dec 11, 2016 at 10:42am PST", "Bill Barry, NASA\u2019s chief historian, said that he views his role as a translator between NASA\u2019s brilliant minds and the public. When it came to advising the film\u2019s team, he said it was particularly meaningful to show a side of Glenn most had not seen before.\u00a0", "\u201cWell, what I really loved about the movie coming out now is that it really reveals a side of John Glenn that people don\u2019t know. They know John Glenn as hero, senator, astronaut, as the oldest man to go into space. That being said, hardly anybody realizes what an incredibly nice guy he was. He was advocating for people who were not in a position to advocate for themselves,\u201d Barry said.\u00a0", "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty was also at the premiere because of the crucial role her company played in the historic events depicted in the film. She said she hopes the film can play a role in inspiring future Katherine Johnsons.\u00a0", "\u201cThis is a movie is about the role three wonderful young women played in our history and it\u2019s also about what IBM did in our history \u2014 we were part of the space missions, and the role of science technology and engineering and math,\u201d Rometty said. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to get more women involved in science, technology, engineering, and math.\u201d", "It\u2019s fitting that a film about groundbreaking figures would attract other influencers to its team. Production designer Wynn Thomas said it was exciting to return to \u201cthe world of math\u201d after designing films like \u201cA Beautiful Mind.\u201d He also said he found himself reflecting on his own experiences as a black man forging his way in Hollywood as he was working on the film.\u00a0", "\u201cThis is a story that I had never heard about before, had no idea that there were women working in NASA doing all of this terrific math work and had no idea there were black women who were also working there doing such important work at NASA,\u201d he said. \u201cThe film really resonated with me because I know what it\u2019s like to kind of be the first and what kind of energy and focus and hard work it takes to change people\u2019s minds.\u201d", "Clip (1) :Was such a pleasure to interview the one-and-only Dr. Yvonne Cagle, @nasa astronaut, who spoke about the other trailblazers profiled in #HiddenFigures as well as the passing of the late, great John Glenn. #JohnGlenn #NASA #sciencenews #moviepremiere #chelsea #chelseanyc #latergram #nyc", "A video posted by Brian Mastroianni (@bmastroianni) on Dec 11, 2016 at 10:27am PST", "It\u2019s something that was on Cagle\u2019s mind, too, as she headed down the carpet and into the film screening.\u00a0", "\u201cI have to say my story started when I was 12 years old, and so I saw people reaching for the stars in 1969 when humans first landed on the moon. ...

Most outsiders drop in for two reasons: business and animals. A short flight from spectacular wildlife parks such as the Maasai Mara, Nairobi has also become a magnet for some of the world\u2019s biggest corporations trying to gain a foothold in Africa. The city is surprisingly beautiful with flowering trees and the perfect climate: 70s and 80s, sunny, low humidity \u2014 almost every day. It\u2019s a palpably multicultural place, encapsulating what is happening in Africa better than any other city on the continent. Picture new construction, a lot of people, intense traffic, and more and more Western businesses. Yet you can still feed giraffes and baby elephants from within the city limits and see Maasai warriors ordering lattes in red-checkered blankets.", "36 Hours in Nairobi, Kenya Explore street view, find things to do in Nairobi and sign in to your Google account to save your map. Friday 1. Curio Madness, 4 P.M. Plunge in. Haggle hard. And console yourself that if you do get ripped off \u2014 which is almost inevitable \u2014 the people on the other side of that 500 shilling note probably need it more than you. Friday is Maasai Market day at the Village Market Mall in northern Nairobi, and this is the best place to load up on East African souvenirs, from toy airplanes made of bottle caps to Obama Africa T-shirts and kanga cloth. The vendors are pushy but friendly and not averse to talking about life as you bargain. Few things have a marked price. That\u2019s the fun. 2. Into Africa, 6 P.M. Indians arrived more than a century ago to help build the railway across East Africa known as the Lunatic Express. (Some of the original workmen were eaten by lions). Thankfully, the Indian community flourished, and there is no better way to get a taste of it than at the Diamond Plaza food court in Nairobi\u2019s Indian quarter. Diamond Plaza is an old mall where everything is two-thirds scale: The streets are two-thirds as wide, the buildings two-thirds tall; it has the feel of a toy town. The food is served from a dozen booths arranged around outdoor tables. A favorite is Anil\u2019s chicken tikka on the bone with gooey naan bread slathered in butter, costing together 600 Kenyan shillings (about $6). Wash this down with fresh ginger sugar cane juice for 150 shillings. Don\u2019t miss Chowpaty\u2019s vegetarian chana masala (675 shillings). 3. African Country Music, 8 P.M. Kenyans adore country music. You hear it on the radio all the time. The leader is a man whose name joins these two seemingly incongruous cultures: Elvis Otieno (Sir Elvis, as he is known, whose parents named him after The King). You can catch Sir Elvis at the Gallileo Lounge in the Westlands neighborhood, among other venues. Close your eyes and let his purring baritone sink in, and you might think Don Williams had wandered into Kenya. Find out where Sir Elvis is playing in UP Nairobi Magazine, Kenya\u2019s equivalent of Time Out. Photo Visitors ride a ferris wheel at the Mamba crocodile farm. Credit Sam Wolson for The New York Times Saturday 4. Get Moving, 7:30 A.M. Wildlife safaris are wonderful, but they tend to be sedentary, full of long drives and big meals. About an hour and a half outside Nairobi lies Mount Longonot National Park, a beautiful emerald green dormant volcano. It\u2019s a rigorous hourlong hike to the top, where you can scan the Great Rift Valley, cradle of mankind. You\u2019ll see buffaloes, zebras and, maybe, baboons. You can hike around the crater rim, which takes about four hours. You don\u2019t need a guide but if you would like to hire one, several are at the park gates. Admission 2,700 shillings. 5. Another Slice of Quiet, 10 A.M. Feeling less ambitious but still eager to stretch your legs? Karura Forest, in the middle of the city, offers more than 2,500 acres of trails, bicycles to rent and a little history. Mau Mau rebels who fought for Kenya\u2019s independence in the 1950s hid out here, and you can peek into their caves. You can also take in waterfalls, butterfly-filled meadows and many species of tall trees. Listen for the eerie bark of the Sykes monkeys; you might see a gang of them swinging through the trees, a blur in the leaves. Admission 600 shillings. Lunch at Brown\u2019s Cheese.

At Nairobi\u2019s Giraffe Center, you can feed Rothschild\u2019s giraffes food pellets from your palm, and stick a pellet between your lips and get the wettest, stickiest kiss you\u2019ve received since seventh grade. Of course, you do this for the greater good. The Giraffe Center uses proceeds to help breed and resettle endangered Rothschild\u2019s giraffes. Fun facts: Giraffes sleep a maximum of two hours each day, and their coats are just like snowflakes, no two have the same pattern. 12. Adopt an Elephant, 11 A.M. China\u2019s insatiable demand for ivory has driven up the price of elephant tusks to $500 a pound. African poachers are now colluding with Asian gangsters, and in recent years more than 100,000 of some of the most intelligent life-forms on earth have been slaughtered to make combs, bookmarks and other ivory trinkets popular in Beijing. At the David Sheldrick elephant orphanage, from 11 a.m. to noon daily you can feed and pet orphaned elephants, many whose mothers were felled by bullets. If that isn\u2019t enough, \u201cadopt\u201d one \u2014 you can come off-hours and watch the elephant keepers tuck them in and put them to bed. 13. Feast, 12:30 P.M. The Talisman restaurant in Karen, the neighborhood of Nairobi where Karen Blixen once lived, is a meeting ground for Kenya\u2019s who\u2019s who. Both sprawling and cozy \u2014 with shaded outdoor tables, a playground and nooks next to the fireplace for cooler days \u2014 it offers excellent food.

Butler/NBAE/Getty Images", "How would Boston history be different if Doc Rivers had Tony Parker as his point man?\u00a0AP Photo/Eric Gay"], "targetParagraphs": ["SAN ANTONIO -- If only for a couple of minutes, Tony Parker started thinking about life as a member of the Boston Celtics. Sitting inside Madison Square Garden and waiting for his name to be called late in the first round of the 2001 NBA draft, Parker had been handed a Celtics cap, an indication that the team planned to select him with the No. 21 pick that was approaching.", "But before Boston's selection even went on the clock, former NBA vice president of player development Chrysa Chin, lovingly nicknamed \"Hat Lady\" by those who received draft-night caps from her through the years, swooped in to retrieve the lid. The Celtics, she apologized, were going in a different direction.", "For the better part of the past two decades, fans of the Celtics have lamented how Boston missed out on the opportunity to draft Tim Duncan. The truth is that, once the pingpong balls defied them, the Celtics never truly had a chance to nab Duncan.", "Now that Duncan has retired, it's time to shift the spotlight to another future Spurs Hall of Famer, one whom the Celtics whiffed three times on picking, none more noticeable than with their final pick in the 2001 draft, when Boston instead selected guard Joe Forte.", "\"I don't remember what happened [with Parker], but normally what happens when a player doesn't get the hat that he's supposed to is there's been a change in the pick or there's been a trade, or a trade is coming, or there was discussion of a trade and maybe it was unsettled,\" said Chin, who now serves as the executive vice president of strategy and development for the National Basketball Players Association.", "\"It happens quite a bit where, at that time, I would give a player a hat, then you'd have to go back and get the hat back. Sometimes families want to keep it to sort of document the history and all of that, but it's normally not anything sort of catastrophic. It's sort of an operations issue.\"", "Yes, the perils of live TV. Fortunately, in the days before Twitter and cellphone cameras, no one noticed the switcheroo. Still, poor Parker, who sat in the stands despite not being one of the invited draftees, then had to wait until San Antonio finally selected him with the 28th pick. This time, Chin greeted Parker on the arena floor with a Spurs cap and directed him to the stage. During TNT's broadcast, former Celtics coach Rick Pitino detailed why Parker might have been on Boston's radar.", "\"The Boston coaching staff, they thought this was the premier point guard in the draft,\" Pitino said. \"They loved him. If Forte was not available, they probably would have gone with Tony Parker. This is someone who is very, very highly valued in the league and can really shoot it and play the point position.\"", "With three picks, including two in the lottery, the Celtics essentially emerged with 48 games of Joe Johnson at No. 10; Kedrick Brown, a freak junior college athlete who was heavily rumored to be heading to Portland but never did at No. 11; and one forgettable season with Forte.", "Six All-Star appearances and four NBA titles later, it's fair to say things worked out just fine for Parker. But that night has certainly stuck with him.", "\"[The Celtics] made my eyes water on draft night,\" Parker recalled during Grantland's BS Report podcast at All-Star weekend in 2013. \"I'm going to tell you a true story. True story. True story. The draft, you have that NBA lady, Chrysa -- she comes to me, and it was the 19th pick, she gives me a Celtics cap and says, 'They are going to pick you.' And it was like three minutes left on the clock, and you have five minutes to pick. Then at one minute she comes back and takes the cap, [and says,] 'Oh no, they changed their mind.' They took my cap. I was like, 'What?'", "\"And so then they drafted Joe Forte. I was always curious what happened. One day I asked the GM, Chris Wallace, I was like, 'What happened in the draft, like when you changed your mind?' Because the day before, I had practiced for Boston. So I did two workouts -- I did the normal workout, then the day before the draft they did a workout. It was Jim O'Brien at the time, the coach, and he was like, 'We want to draft you, but the Spurs are going to try to make a trade at 20, but if you're available at 21, for sure we'll take you.' The coach and the GM, they wanted me, but the president, big boss, he changed his mind.\"", "That big boss, of course, was Red Auerbach, who lit two cigars in celebration of the Forte pick. And while it's now well-documented that Forte was the last hand-picked selection for Auerbach, who had watched Forte play in high school in Maryland and likely trumped those who might have preferred Parker. Remember, too, the pick was widely praised at the time.", "In the aftermath of the draft, Auerbach proclaimed that Forte was an, \"ideal 2-guard; he can flat-out shoot the ball.\" Alas, Forte could not flat-out shoot the ball. He made only one field goal in 12 career attempts with Boston. He played a mere 39 minutes in eight games. Thirteen months after drafting Forte, the Celtics traded him to Seattle as part of the package that returned Vin Baker (and somehow that might have been an even worse personnel decision).", "Forte is otherwise remembered in Boston only for his curious fashion choices. He once reportedly wore a Magic Johnson jersey to a team meeting, seemingly oblivious at the time to the history between the franchises. He atoned by wearing a Bill Russell throwback jersey on the bench during one of the games he was inactive for, though he's better remembered for donning a Scooby-Doo sweater in the days before a more stringent NBA dress code.", "Forte appeared in just 17 games for Seattle and had an even rougher go there (the Washington Post detailed how he wore a Michael Jordan jersey the night of a Wizards game that ended with him getting in a fight in the team showers). Forte's final NBA career averages: 1.2 points, 0.7 rebounds, 0.7 assists over 5 minutes per game. He briefly latched on with the Asheville Attitude of the NBA D-League, playing close to his college roots in North Carolina, before embarking on a decade-long overseas career that included stops in Greece, Italy, Russia, Iran and Israel.", "Now in his 16th NBA season, Parker isn't quite the force he once was. But he can still turn back the clock, as he did in Saturday's win over the Nets when he put up 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting over 20 minutes.", "That's twice as many points more than Forte ever scored for Boston."], "targetTitle": "Celtics' spur of the moment move altered the paths of two franchises", "postTimestamp": "Thu Dec 15 03:40:04 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "NBA, Boston Celtics, Tony Parker, San Antonio Spurs", "targetDescription": "After a career of wise moves, the late Red Auerbach's final draft decision was overruling his staff and taking Joe Forte over Tony Parker in 2001, a pick that looks worse with each passing year."}

No-one denied its conclusions: senior Australians get tax breaks unavailable to younger Australians worth $1 billion a year \u2014 and that's not even counting the tax breaks from superannuation. Instead, many seniors argued that they were entitled to a better deal.", "This sense of entitlement is based on genuine views that today's seniors have done it tougher than the generations coming after them. Many seniors believe that they've paid higher taxes and the government is paying for family benefits and childcare they never got. They believe they've borne the brunt of budget cuts over the last few years. And to the extent that they've accumulated wealth, they believe they paid higher mortgages rates and saved harder to get there.", "Many younger people have a different take. Fewer of them can afford to buy a house. University debts hang around their necks. Secure employment is harder to find. And they're acutely aware that someone will have to pay for recurrent budget deficits, and \"someone\" is likely to be them.", "It's unproductive if generations just talk past each other. But it wouldn't be the first time. Both older and younger generations have factoids for their point of view, so they're unlikely to back down. But it might be helpful if everyone could see the bigger picture to understand what's going on.", "In a typical discussion, grandpa might say that he paid higher rates of income tax than today. If so, grandpa was working very hard. The top rate of personal income tax in 1985-86 was 60 per cent, but it only applied if grandpa earned more than $35,000. It mightn't sound like much, but adjusted for higher incomes that's $161,000 in today's money.", "To understand the overall burden of income tax on an entire generation over a working life, one can look at income taxes as a share of the economy (see chart below). It's a little higher today than the average of the past four decades. The average grandfather paid a little less income tax than today. If budget forecasts are to be believed, income taxes will be close to the peaks of the late 1980s and 1990s within the next three years.", "Irrespective of who has paid more tax in the past, some seniors argue that after a lifetime of paying tax they shouldn't have to keep doing so once they retire.", "If great-grandfather is still alive, he might interrupt at this point. Previous generations of retirees did not opt out of the tax system at age 65. In fact, 20 years ago almost twice as many older Australians paid personal income tax as do today.", "The number of over 65s \"taxed-nots\" increased because the Howard government abolished taxes on superannuation withdrawals for those aged over 60 years in 2007, and introduced much more generous tax offsets only available to older Australians \u2013 such as the Seniors and Pensioners Tax Offset.", "Not only do fewer seniors by number pay income tax; but on average senior households also pay a lower amount of income tax in real terms today than senior households 20 years ago, even though both their workforce participation rates and their incomes have jumped.", "In any case, developed countries today can't afford an entire generation that stops paying tax. Because of the baby boom, over-65s are a rapidly increasing share of the population. And with rising life expectancies they will spend more of their lives not paying tax.", "At the same time, over 65s can expect to be drawing on government support (particularly health care) for much longer than previous generations.", "Grandma will doubtless say that younger generations have always looked after older generations. Older households have always received more benefits (welfare and in-kind services such as health) from government than they paid in taxes. Under the intergenerational bargain, government has always been a \"piggy bank\" transferring resources from younger working households to older retired households.", "But the intergenerational bargain has become a lot more skewed over the last decade. In 2004, the average senior household took about $22,000 more out of the government tin in services and welfare payments than it contributed in sales and income taxes. By 2010 the net take had jumped by almost $10,000 in today's money to $32,000 per senior household. Meanwhile the net contributions of other age groups reduced somewhat (see chart below). The cost of these increased transfers to older households was about $22 billion a year, or about half the Commonwealth government's annual budget deficits of recent years.", "Part of this jump was higher health spending such as government spending on doctors, hospitals, subsidised medicines via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and subsidised pathology services. Real spending on health has doubled for a person of a given age over the last 20 years. And so government spending on a 70 year old has gone from $5,800 to $10,700 in the last 20 years.", "Overall, the net take by older households has increased even further because they are also paying less tax.", "This might have seemed affordable while the mining boom boosted government revenues. But today's budget deficits and much slower economic growth suggest it is unsustainable. More is being taken from the piggy bank than anyone is putting in.", "At this point, grandpa is likely to point to all the extra spending for families that wasn't there a generation ago \u2013 family payments, childcare benefits, and the like.", "In terms of the changes over the last 15 years, it is true that budget giveaways to families with children in the 2000s under Howard were much bigger than the giveaways to seniors. But one of the quiet successes of the Rudd/Gillard governments was to wind back much of these extra family benefits, restricting the payments more tightly to families in genuine need.", "The cumulative cost to today's Commonwealth Budget of decisions over the past 15 years to expand support for families and seniors is now almost identical, with each now costing the Budget around $8 billion a year.", "And there's a crucial difference. Some of the remaining net increase in transfers to families is for childcare ($1.6 billion). The evidence is overwhelming that increased support for childcare tends to increase how much women work when they have children. As the Commonwealth government has increased support for childcare, a greater proportion of women with young children now work.", "Grandma may well complain that government has made a series of decisions over the last three budgets that have affected seniors such as tightening the Age Pension assets test, and winding back superannuation tax breaks. But decisions affecting families, symbolised by axing the Baby Bonus, have been even larger over the last three years \u2013 and bigger again once you include the three years before that.", "The reality is that no-one can really complain. The only way to reduce persistent budget deficits of around $40 billion a year is for government to tighten the belt and increase taxes in ways that are going to affect pretty much everyone.", "This analysis doesn't include bracket creep, which technically doesn't count as a budget measure, even though it has made the biggest contribution to budget repair. Over the last eight years, bracket creep has been largely unchecked, and has largely reversed the mid-2000s personal income tax cuts. And of course bracket creep affects working families much more than seniors.", "Ah, says Grandpa, but you younger generations have had it easy with global interest rates at their lowest in at least 5,000 years. People who lived through the late 1980s will never forget paying mortgage rates of 17 per cent.", "But interest rates are only one part of the housing affordability story. The pain of mortgage repayments also depends on how much you paid for the home, and how fast the loan gets eroded by inflation and rising wages. The typical home today costs four times a typical household income. 20 years ago it was only 2.5 times. And inflation in the 1980s averaged 8.4 per cent; whereas inflation today is around 1.5 per cent.", "The bigger picture looks at how much of a household's income goes to paying off the mortgage (see chart below). And mortgage interest payments today eat up more of a household's income than in 1989 when interest rates peaked. And of course today's borrowers are much more vulnerable: if interest rates rise from today's historic lows, their interest payments will spiral to record levels.", "As a result, younger generations today are much less likely to own their home than younger generations in the past.", "Housing is part of a bigger picture: seniors are taking an increasing share of the country's wealth. Between 2004 and 2014, seniors households (over 65) increased their share of total wealth from 25 per cent to 30 per cent. Despite the global financial crisis, households aged between 65 and 74 years today are $400,000 (or 47 per cent) wealthier in real terms than households of that age ten years ago. Households aged between 45 and 54 in 2004 increased their average wealth by about $500,000 over the subsequent decade.", "Yes, says grandma, and that's because we scrimped and saved while you ate too many smashed avocadoes. Well, perhaps. But on the numbers, households of all age groups are saving much more today than in 2004.", "The real advantage for older households was that they were in the right place at the right time. They already owned assets when interest rates fell in a move that probably won't repeat for several generations. And this fall in interest rates pushed asset values upwards. By contrast, households aged 25 to 34 years typically bought both housing and superannuation assets at these higher prices, missing out on the free kick.", "Everyone would like to believe that their prosperity is the result of hard work. And hard work by individual households does make a difference. But no generation really works that much harder than its predecessor. The reality is that luck has played a big part in creating a generation much wealthier than its parents, and probably wealthier than its children.", "There may well be vociferous agreement that budget repair remains a priority with the Commonwealth government spending $11 for every $10 in revenue. Winding back expenses or increasing revenues by 10 per cent is a big ask, and it won't happen unless people from all generations contribute.", "That includes seniors, many of whom continue to be on a very good wicket. Even after the Turnbull government's superannuation package, most retirees will still pay no tax on their super withdrawals or earnings. We continue to have age based tax breaks that result in many younger workers paying more tax than seniors on similar incomes.", "Of course if great-aunt Agatha hasn't got much, and her main income is a full Age Pension, she shouldn't pay income tax \u2013 and nor should younger Australians on similarly low incomes. That's how a progressive personal income tax system is supposed to work. But if grandpa has income from investments plus a part pension, so that he's got more to live on than his granddaughter on a basic wage of $35,000, it seems fair enough that grandpa should pay at least as much tax as his granddaughter.", "As we've seen, grandpa probably didn't pay more income tax over his life, is paying less income tax in retirement than his parents, is benefiting far more from government services, has not borne a disproportionate share of budget repair over the past few years, didn't spend more of his income paying back the mortgage, and may well own assets that his grandchildren will only dream about.", "There will always be a generation gap. We can narrow it if each generation understands the facts behind the other generation's point of view.

As such, we've put together a brief profile of the man who may soon be in charge of the United States' international diplomacy, assuming he is confirmed.", "Tillerson has no experience in the public sector, a first in modern history for a potential secretary of state. Tillerson, 64, joined ExxonMobil in 1975, after receiving a civil engineering degree from the University of Texas. He worked his way up through the ranks, beginning as a production engineer and becoming chairman and chief executive in 2006.", "Over his decades at the company, Tillerson's work took him all over the world, including to Yemen and Russia. That, along with his experience as CEO, apparently provides the basis of his familiarity with international diplomacy.", "On Twitter, a former ExxonMobil employee who is now at Brookings Institution defended Tillerson's experience. \u201cOil folks know stuff: anyone who manages multibillion dollar, multi-decade projects needs deep, nuanced understanding of political context,\u201d Suzanne Maloney wrote\u00a0on Twitter. \u201c\u2026 Tillerson rose to top of a company that prizes technical excellence, rock-solid financials, hard work and integrity.

Putin himself announced the deal at a meeting in Sochi (where the Winter Olympics would be held the next year).", "Several senators have expressed concerns about this relationship, including Sen. Marco Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That committee will need to approve the Tillerson pick in order for the full Senate to vote on his nomination; it's currently at a 10-to-9 Republican-Democratic split.", "Tillerson's stake in ExxonMobil will certainly raise questions at a confirmation hearing. Once Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the United States instituted sanctions against Russia that froze ExxonMobil's Arctic agreement. Were those sanctions to be lifted, the deal would probably move forward \u2014 making Tillerson's shares of ExxonMobil stock much more valuable. (The Wall Street Journal noted\u00a0that he'd probably have to divest from that stock if appointed to run the State Department.)", "Tillerson's position on climate change may be to the left of Trump's. ExxonMobil understood the connection between greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use and the warming climate as early as 1977, according to recent reporting. It then proceeded to combat the idea, recognizing the risk posed to its industry by curtailing fossil fuel use. Only fairly recently did it acknowledge that link publicly, and the company is now on record in support of accepting the established science and identifying solutions to the problem of climate change.", "That shift happened under Tillerson's leadership. The issue of climate change will be a potent one for whoever takes over the State Department, given the long-standing international diplomacy efforts to address the issue. Shortly before this year's election, ExxonMobil issued a statement in support of the sweeping agreement reached in Paris at the end of last year aimed at cutting down on carbon dioxide emissions internationally.", "Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he opposed the Paris agreement and has regularly expressed his opposition to taking action to address climate change. Tillerson, as CEO, promoted positions contrary to that. His most recent personal comments echoed the sentiment of his company, calling the threat of climate change \u201creal\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d \u2014 though the extent to which he was speaking as a representative of ExxonMobil vs. his own views is worth asking.", "Tillerson is a lifelong Boy Scout.

Sessions claimed he had been joking.", "Retired Gen. James Mattis, Secretary of Defense \u2014 Mattis, a former commander of U.S. Central Command, is known for his blunt, outspoken style and his selection likely signals Trump will take an increasingly hardline stance with Iran.

As head of homeland security, Kelly will be responsible for overseeing Trump's controversial immigration plans. As Southern Command chief, Kelly oversaw U.S. military operations in South and Central America -- including the southern border. He, like Trump, has expressed concerns over drug trafficking across the U.S.-Mexico border.", "Rep. Tom Price, Secretary of Health and Human Services \u2014 Georgia Rep.

He began his career at Goldman Sachs, where he spent 17 years and rose to become a partner.

Credit Reuters"], "targetParagraphs": ["MARTON, England \u2014 Andrew Woodward grew up with a soccer ball between his feet. His room, in a working-class housing estate, was filled with posters of famous players and his head with dreams of becoming a defender for England. When he was 9, he scored a goal from the halfway line in a school match and raced across the field into the arms of his father, who said he was \u201cthe proudest dad in the world.\u201d", "Two years later, Mr. Woodward was spotted by Barry Bennell, a well-known soccer scout and youth coach in northern England. It was September 1984, and Mr. Bennell told Mr. Woodward\u2019s parents that he could turn their son into a professional player. Could he come train at Crewe Alexandra, a professional club, and stay with him on weekends to improve his skills?", "It would prove to be the beginning of a four-year ordeal of harrowing sexual abuse \u2014 and it has turned out not to be the only one.", "After scandals in children\u2019s homes, in the Roman Catholic Church, in the police and in the entertainment industry, where the child abuser Jimmy Savile is said to have assaulted dozens of youngsters, soccer is the latest British institution to face allegations of the sexual exploitation of children on a broad scale.", "The nature and extent of the abuse has come as a shock to the country that invented modern soccer and is home to the Premier League, the richest and most widely watched league in the world. Just as troubling is the apparent reluctance at club level to act decisively to stop the abuse then, and more recently.", "Two years ago, Chelsea, one of the richest clubs in the world, paid a former player, Gary Johnson, 50,000 pounds, about $63,000, in an agreement that stopped him from going public with his allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of a former Chelsea youth coach.", "Four weeks ago, Mr. Woodward, who eventually became a defender for Crewe Alexandra, became the first professional soccer player to go public with his claims of abuse. Since then, at least 20 other former players have followed, and many more have contacted the police privately. A help line has fielded over 1,000 calls. At least 20 police forces across Britain have opened investigations into 83 suspects in cases involving about 350 possible victims and 98 soccer clubs from the amateur level to the Premier League.", "In the words of Greg Clarke, the chairman of the Football Association, the governing body that oversees much of soccer in England, it is \u201cone of the biggest crises\u201d in the sport\u2019s history, one that has left Mr. Woodward and many others who suffered at the hands of coaches and officials permanently scarred.", "At first, Mr. Woodward recalled in an interview last week, the opportunity to become a professional player seemed almost too good to be true. Mr. Bennell could spin a ball on his finger, flick it off his shoulders and rest it on his neck before catching it with his heel. \u201cLike a magician,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. The coach\u2019s home, an isolated cottage on the edge of the Peak District in the middle of England, was the stuff of a boy\u2019s dreams. There was a pool table and a jukebox and a monkey that would sit on Mr. Woodward\u2019s shoulder and eat cucumbers. Mr. Woodward said the television was the biggest he had ever seen.", "The first time Mr. Woodward stayed at the cottage, Mr. Bennell gave him a pair of soccer cleats to keep. The second time, he asked him to come into bed and play a game he called \u201cfollow me,\u201d where they took turns touching each other, at Mr. Bennell\u2019s direction.", "The third time, the rapes started and they continued for four years: in a bunk bed with another boy lying above; in a car on the way to training; in youth hostels during soccer tournaments; and, occasionally, in Mr. Woodward\u2019s own house, after Mr. Bennell had eaten dinner with Mr. Woodward\u2019s family.", "When Mr. Woodward resisted, he would be dropped from the next match and made to sit on the bench. \u201cI can ruin your football tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Bennell would tell him, warning: \u201cKeep quiet or you\u2019re finished.\u201d", "Mr. Woodward did keep quiet, until 1998, when the police knocked on his door and told him that Mr. Bennell faced charges of sexual abuse. Mr. Woodward became an anonymous witness in a case in which Mr. Bennell, now 62, was sent to jail for nine years on 23 charges of sexual abuse, including buggery, against six boys. Mr. Bennell had already served a prison sentence in the United States for raping a 13-year-old boy at a soccer holiday camp, and he was convicted again as recently as 2015.", "Since then, Mr. Bennell has been living under an assumed name, but he was taken back into custody after Mr. Woodward went public with his story in The Guardian, a British newspaper, on Nov. 16. Mr. Bennell now faces eight counts of child sexual assault, the Crown Prosecution Service announced last month.", "For years, Mr. Bennell and other pedophilic coaches appear to have been protected by powerful individuals at the clubs where they worked.", "The manager of Crewe Alexandra when Mr. Woodward was being abused, Dario Gradi, was still employed as the club\u2019s director of football until this last weekend. Mr. Gradi was suspended by the Football Association only after another former player said that when Mr. Gradi was assistant manager of Chelsea in the 1970s, he had visited the player\u2019s parents to smooth over the sexual advances of another youth coach, Eddie Heath. Mr. Gradi, who in 1998 was honored by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to soccer, could not be reached for comment.", "In the past, when players tried to bring abuse to the attention of the soccer authorities, they found little sympathy.", "The settlement between Chelsea and Mr. Johnson, who says he was also abused by Mr. Heath, who is now dead, came after Mr. Johnson tried in 2013 to tell the police and soccer authorities about the abuse, prompted by the investigation into Jimmy Savile\u2019s actions. He was ignored every step of the way, Mr. Johnson says. Only last week did Chelsea\u2019s leadership apologize to Mr. Johnson in person, after the club waived the condition that he remain silent.", "The Heath problem has been an internal headache for Chelsea for some time, according to one lawyer familiar with the case, speaking on condition of anonymity because of a continuing investigation.", "The instinct to close ranks and protect the club is one of the reasons Richard Scorer, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon who has worked on sexual abuse cases for 20 years, says he believes that the scandal in soccer will snowball. His firm represented abuse victims in care homes in the mid-1990s, in the Catholic Church in the late 1990s, and, more recently, Mr. Johnson. \u201cProfessional football unites all the risk factors,\u201d he said.", "Like priests, soccer coaches have easy access to children and the trust of parents. But they also have the opportunity for intimate contact with children in showers, changing rooms and on tours.", "Above all, coaches have a relationship with their players characterized by what Mr. Scorer called \u201cnear absolute power.\u201d", "\u201cThey are the gatekeepers of dreams,\u201d he said.", "Mr. Bennell always had two boys to stay for the weekend and sometimes three. During the day, he played soccer with them, took them to matches and treated them to meals at McDonald\u2019s. At night, he showed them scary movies to frighten them and then pull them close.", "Mr. Bennell had a nunchaku \u2014 a weapon made of two short bars with a chain in the middle \u2014 that he liked to show off. He made the boys hold a newspaper and then split it in two with the chain. \u201cWhat we have is special,\u201d he would say. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin it.\u201d", "Mr. Woodward, dark-haired and introverted, was his favorite. \u201cHe would always pick the soft ones with the quiet parents who were less likely to challenge him,\u201d Mr. Woodward recalled.", "Mr. Bennell would come for dinners at his home and wink at him across the table. Sometimes he would stay over in the room next to his parents\u2019 bedroom. Mr. Woodward\u2019s mother would ask her son why he was so quiet when his coach visited.", "When Mr. Woodward was 14, Mr. Bennell began seeing his 16-year-old sister. Two years later, he married her. It is a subject Mr. Woodward cannot bear to talk about except to say that his sister left Mr. Bennell in 1998, the year his former coach went to prison and he finally mustered the courage to tell his family about the years of abuse.", "Coming forward has been a relief, said Mr. Woodward, who has been told he has post-traumatic stress disorder and who has tried to take his life several times. His soccer career ended because of recurring panic attacks on the field. \u201cI was playing under a cloud,\u201d he says today.", "For 12 years, he worked for the police, but he was recently dismissed after a disciplinary tribunal over his having had a relationship with the adult sister of a victim of a crime.", "Even now, age 43, when the soccer results are read out on the radio and his old club is mentioned, he says his stomach turns. He has never returned to Crewe, though it is less than an hour\u2019s drive from his house.", "A picture caption with an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a 1998 match in which Andrew Woodward played.

But details remain up in the air.", "Most likely, Republican lawmakers will in January vote on a special budget package to cut funding for programs in the law down the road. That is the \u201crepeal\u201d part. They would not need Democratic cooperation on this because certain budget bills can be passed with a simple 51-majority vote in the Senate under a process called reconciliation. But those bills must be limited in scope and cannot overturn regulatory rules or marketplace standards such as the law\u2019s ban on lifetime coverage limits.", "\u201cPeople don't understand that a \u2018repeal\u2019 doesn't mean that you pull the rug out,\u201d Ryan said during the interview on CNBC. He added that he did not want Americans \u201cgoing back to the emergency rooms,\u201d because they lost their health care. So, to protect the estimated 20 million Americans who gained health insurance from being left high and dry, it is likely that Republicans will write the budget bill so that funding cuts don't take effect for a year or two.", "\u201cI think now the line is more like \u2018repeal and delay,\u2019 Dr. Michael Chernew, director of the healthcare markets and regulation lab at Harvard Medical School told ABC News. \u201cIt is symbolically important for them to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but deleterious in terms of policy to stop it right now before they know what they want to do.\u201d", "Chernew said he expects that most public subsidies that allowed for states to expand coverage through Medicaid and establish marketplaces for consumers to buy individual insurance will remain through 2017 and perhaps even 2018 in order to maintain relative stability in the health care industry and the overall economy. Under this scenario, people would still be able to buy individual insurance through state-based marketplaces for another year or so. But again, Republicans say all details have yet to be ironed out.", "Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told reporters this week that replacing Obamacare may be a long-term project. \u201cIt took six years to get where we are now and demonstrate the failure of Obamacare, so it\u2019s going to take us a little while to fix it,\u201d he said.", "The Affordable Care Act was drafted by Democrats with the aim of getting insurance companies on board with the law's new requirements and expanded coverage by also imposing mandates that consumers who can afford to buy insurance do so. The law also introduced public subsidies to make it easier for people to buy insurance if their employers do not offer it. Approximately 20 million previously uninsured Americans have gained coverage since the law went into effect, according to the Obama administration.", "Republicans on Capitol Hill have repeatedly said they want to maintain popular provisions of the law, such as prohibiting insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and requiring them to allow young adults up to age 26 to stay on their parents\u2019 plans. However, as Democrats have been quick to note, Republicans have yet to offer specifics on how they would get insurance companies to fulfill these requirements without also continuing the mandate for consumers to buy insurance. The mandate is supposed to ensure that more people, especially the young and healthy, buy coverage, which can help keep overall premium costs down.", "Experts, including two major national hospital advocacy organizations as well as the American Actuary Group, wrote to Republicans recently warning that cutting funding for some parts of the law immediately without at least a blueprint for a future plan could send shockwaves through the health insurance industry and lead to the collapse individual insurance markets. In short, millions of Americans could lose insurance, and doctors and other health care providers could lose paying customers.", "\u201cThe [Affordable Care Act] was designed to solve a problem,\" Chernew said of the millions of Americans who were previously uninsured and now have coverage. \"You can debate whether or not it was a good way to solve that problem or whether it was successful -- and there were some successes and some not -- but the underlying problem remains\u201d of keeping people insured.", "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote to governors across the country seeking their input and advice and told reporters that Republican lawmakers were thinking and talking about these challenges. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing how we can solve the problem but nothing to report yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWait to see what we draft.\u201d", "Democrats, however, have pounced on the lack of details. \u201cThey said they want to start repealing Obamacare the first week \u2026 bring it on,\u201d incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"They don\u2019t know what to do.

(0:17)"], "targetParagraphs": ["The Seahawks were once viewed as the Cowboys' biggest threat in the NFC. But Seattle is just another average team -- at best -- on the road. And the Cowboys have a legitimate, full-fledged nemesis in their own division.", "The Lions, Falcons and Buccaneers don't appear to be going away anytime soon. The AFC South, as sorry as it might be, could be headed for a fantastic finish. And the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos are in real danger of missing the playoffs.", "Here's a look at the NFL's playoff picture at this moment.", "1. Dallas Cowboys (11-2). A win Sunday night would have clinched the NFC East and a first-round bye for the Cowboys. They still seem likely to earn both, but they have to wait at least one week. And if they face the Giants in the playoffs, there will be legitimate questions about whether that's the matchup that could derail their Super Bowl dreams.", "2. Detroit Lions (9-4). Another week, another comeback victory for banged-up Matthew Stafford and the Lions, who move into position for a bye thanks to Seattle's loss. The Lions go to New Jersey to play the Giants next week, then to Dallas the following week before finishing at home against the Packers. So it's not going to be easy to hold this spot. But the Lions don't seem to like to do things easy, do they?", "3. Seattle Seahawks (8-4-1). Yet another hideous road performance by Russell Wilson and a Seattle team that has now lost in Los Angeles, New Orleans, Tampa Bay and Green Bay and tied in Arizona. Sunday's loss dropped the Seahawks into a position that would require them to play three games to reach the Super Bowl. They still can clinch the division with a win or an Arizona loss next week. Two of their remaining three games are at home, where they're 6-0 and clearly a different team. But here's the bad news: It looks increasingly likely that they'll have to play at least one road game in January.", "4. Atlanta Falcons (8-5). Who needs Julio Jones? Not the Falcons to beat the Rams. After laying waste to Jeff Fisher's crew in Los Angeles, the Falcons keep the slightest of edges over Tampa Bay in the NFC South. They have identical overall records, identical conference records and went 1-1 against each other. The only thing keeping Atlanta in first place right now: its 6-3 record against opponents it has in common with the Bucs. Tampa Bay is 5-4 in such games. This will remain super tight throughout the rest of the regular season. And neither is out of the picture yet in terms of a first-round bye.", "5. New York Giants (9-4). Sunday night's game was huge for the Giants' psyche, coming off a tough loss in Pittsburgh and the loss of one of their best defensive players, Jason Pierre-Paul due to injury. They are the only team to beat the Cowboys this year and they've now done it twice. They also maintain a two-game lead on a playoff spot and, depending on the way the games break, could clinch their first playoff appearance since 2011 as early as next week.", "6. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-5). That's five wins in a row for the Bucs, who are right on the tails of Atlanta and the Giants in the division and wild-card standings. The Bucs have won in Kansas City and in San Diego during their current streak, so don't assume they can't go to Dallas next week and give the Cowboys a game. Then they finish with the Saints and Panthers.", "Surging: The Green Bay Packers (7-6) have won three in a row to move onto the cusp of the NFC wild-card race. They're two games behind Detroit in the division race, which may be too much to overcome, even though they finish the season in Detroit. Green Bay is right behind Tampa Bay and Washington and even with Minnesota. Aaron Rodgers suggested \"running the table\" not long ago, and if the Packers do that and reach 10-6 ... who knows? They're at Chicago and home to Minnesota the next two weeks.", "Slipping: The Philadelphia Eagles (5-8) started the season 3-0 and stood at 4-2 after dealing the Vikings their first loss of the season in Week 7. But the Eagles have lost six of their past seven, and after Sunday\u2019s tough loss to Washington, they\u2019re turning their attention to next season. Carson Wentz has shown enough in his rookie season to encourage the Eagles about their future. But if the other three teams in the NFC East have really improved this much, the Eagles have some work to do before next season kicks off.", "Worth noting: The Buccaneers have not reached the playoffs since 2007, and they really haven't come all that close. This is the first time since 2010 that they've won as many as eight games in a season, and this season will end the Bucs' streak of five straight fourth-place finishes in the NFC South.", "1. New England Patriots (11-2). The Patriots are alone in first after beating the Baltimore Ravens (7-6) on Monday night, but they still haven't clinched the AFC East.", "2. Kansas City Chiefs (10-3). Thursday night\u2019s victory over Oakland moved the Chiefs into a first-place tie in the AFC West, but their 2-0 record over the Raiders this season gives them the tiebreaker. Kansas City has home games left against the Titans and Broncos and a road game in San Diego.", "3. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-5). Pittsburgh stands alone by a game in the AFC North after the Ravens' loss. The AFC North race still could come down to the Dec. 25 game between the Ravens and Steelers in Pittsburgh.", "4. Houston Texans (7-6). The Texans' victory in Indianapolis kept them in a first-place division tie with the Tennessee Titans, but Houston has the tiebreaker because of a head-to-head victory. And the Texans' 4-0 division record gives them a strong tiebreaker edge over the Titans\u2019 1-3 division record. So even if the Texans lose in Nashville in Week 17, they\u2019d still win the division on the tiebreaker if those two teams had the same record.", "5. Oakland Raiders (10-3). A tough loss Thursday night knocked Oakland out of a bye and into a wild-card spot. But Denver\u2019s loss in Tennessee on Sunday helped the Raiders, who can lock up a playoff spot next week even as they still hope to capture one of those first-round byes. They\u2019ll have to beat the Chiefs outright to win the division. The Raiders have road games in San Diego and Denver and a home game against the Colts still to go.", "6. Denver Broncos (8-5). They hold the slightest tiebreaker advantage over the 8-5 Dolphins, because they have identical 5-4 records against AFC opponents, but Denver is 2-2 and Miami is 1-2 in games against common opponents.", "Surging: The Tennessee Titans (7-6) suddenly look like a real factor in both the AFC South and wild-card races. A victory over the Super Bowl champion Broncos on Sunday stamps Marcus Mariota & Co. as legitimate playoff contenders who now own a head-to-head tiebreaker over Denver. And the Titans get a shot at Houston at home in Week 17. The AFC South tiebreakers don\u2019t favor the Titans, but if they win out, they\u2019ll be division champs. They have road games in Kansas City and Jacksonville before the intra-division finale.", "Slipping: Sunday\u2019s game was something like a playoff for the Indianapolis Colts (6-7). Indy is in serious danger of missing the playoffs for the second season in a row. They're in third place in the AFC South, and they're 0-2 against the Texans. On top of that, the Colts have tough road games coming up in Minnesota and Oakland before the layup home finale against the Jaguars."], "targetTitle": "NFL playoff picture: Giants delay Cowboys' clinching party", "postTimestamp": "Mon Dec 12 15:00:51 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "", "targetDescription": "A win on Sunday would have clinched the NFC East and a first-round bye for the Cowboys, but they have to wait at least one week."}

And the Cowboys have a legitimate, full-fledged nemesis in their own division.", "The Lions, Falcons and Buccaneers don't appear to be going away anytime soon. The AFC South, as sorry as it might be, could be headed for a fantastic finish. And the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos are in real danger of missing the playoffs.", "Here's a look at the NFL's playoff picture at this moment.", "1. Dallas Cowboys (11-2). A win Sunday night would have clinched the NFC East and a first-round bye for the Cowboys. They still seem likely to earn both, but they have to wait at least one week. And if they face the Giants in the playoffs, there will be legitimate questions about whether that's the matchup that could derail their Super Bowl dreams.", "2. Detroit Lions (9-4). Another week, another comeback victory for banged-up Matthew Stafford and the Lions, who move into position for a bye thanks to Seattle's loss. The Lions go to New Jersey to play the Giants next week, then to Dallas the following week before finishing at home against the Packers. So it's not going to be easy to hold this spot. But the Lions don't seem to like to do things easy, do they?", "3. Seattle Seahawks (8-4-1). Yet another hideous road performance by Russell Wilson and a Seattle team that has now lost in Los Angeles, New Orleans, Tampa Bay and Green Bay and tied in Arizona. Sunday's loss dropped the Seahawks into a position that would require them to play three games to reach the Super Bowl. They still can clinch the division with a win or an Arizona loss next week. Two of their remaining three games are at home, where they're 6-0 and clearly a different team. But here's the bad news: It looks increasingly likely that they'll have to play at least one road game in January.", "4. Atlanta Falcons (8-5). Who needs Julio Jones? Not the Falcons to beat the Rams. After laying waste to Jeff Fisher's crew in Los Angeles, the Falcons keep the slightest of edges over Tampa Bay in the NFC South. They have identical overall records, identical conference records and went 1-1 against each other. The only thing keeping Atlanta in first place right now: its 6-3 record against opponents it has in common with the Bucs. Tampa Bay is 5-4 in such games. This will remain super tight throughout the rest of the regular season. And neither is out of the picture yet in terms of a first-round bye.", "5. New York Giants (9-4). Sunday night's game was huge for the Giants' psyche, coming off a tough loss in Pittsburgh and the loss of one of their best defensive players, Jason Pierre-Paul due to injury. They are the only team to beat the Cowboys this year and they've now done it twice. They also maintain a two-game lead on a playoff spot and, depending on the way the games break, could clinch their first playoff appearance since 2011 as early as next week.", "6. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-5). That's five wins in a row for the Bucs, who are right on the tails of Atlanta and the Giants in the division and wild-card standings. The Bucs have won in Kansas City and in San Diego during their current streak, so don't assume they can't go to Dallas next week and give the Cowboys a game. Then they finish with the Saints and Panthers.", "Surging: The Green Bay Packers (7-6) have won three in a row to move onto the cusp of the NFC wild-card race. They're two games behind Detroit in the division race, which may be too much to overcome, even though they finish the season in Detroit. Green Bay is right behind Tampa Bay and Washington and even with Minnesota. Aaron Rodgers suggested \"running the table\" not long ago, and if the Packers do that and reach 10-6 ... who knows? They're at Chicago and home to Minnesota the next two weeks.", "Slipping: The Philadelphia Eagles (5-8) started the season 3-0 and stood at 4-2 after dealing the Vikings their first loss of the season in Week 7. But the Eagles have lost six of their past seven, and after Sunday\u2019s tough loss to Washington, they\u2019re turning their attention to next season. Carson Wentz has shown enough in his rookie season to encourage the Eagles about their future. But if the other three teams in the NFC East have really improved this much, the Eagles have some work to do before next season kicks off.", "Worth noting: The Buccaneers have not reached the playoffs since 2007, and they really haven't come all that close. This is the first time since 2010 that they've won as many as eight games in a season, and this season will end the Bucs' streak of five straight fourth-place finishes in the NFC South.", "1. New England Patriots (11-2). The Patriots are alone in first after beating the Baltimore Ravens (7-6) on Monday night, but they still haven't clinched the AFC East.", "2. Kansas City Chiefs (10-3). Thursday night\u2019s victory over Oakland moved the Chiefs into a first-place tie in the AFC West, but their 2-0 record over the Raiders this season gives them the tiebreaker. Kansas City has home games left against the Titans and Broncos and a road game in San Diego.", "3. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-5). Pittsburgh stands alone by a game in the AFC North after the Ravens' loss. The AFC North race still could come down to the Dec. 25 game between the Ravens and Steelers in Pittsburgh.", "4. Houston Texans (7-6). The Texans' victory in Indianapolis kept them in a first-place division tie with the Tennessee Titans, but Houston has the tiebreaker because of a head-to-head victory. And the Texans' 4-0 division record gives them a strong tiebreaker edge over the Titans\u2019 1-3 division record. So even if the Texans lose in Nashville in Week 17, they\u2019d still win the division on the tiebreaker if those two teams had the same record.", "5. Oakland Raiders (10-3). A tough loss Thursday night knocked Oakland out of a bye and into a wild-card spot. But Denver\u2019s loss in Tennessee on Sunday helped the Raiders, who can lock up a playoff spot next week even as they still hope to capture one of those first-round byes. They\u2019ll have to beat the Chiefs outright to win the division. The Raiders have road games in San Diego and Denver and a home game against the Colts still to go.", "6. Denver Broncos (8-5). They hold the slightest tiebreaker advantage over the 8-5 Dolphins, because they have identical 5-4 records against AFC opponents, but Denver is 2-2 and Miami is 1-2 in games against common opponents.", "Surging: The Tennessee Titans (7-6) suddenly look like a real factor in both the AFC South and wild-card races. A victory over the Super Bowl champion Broncos on Sunday stamps Marcus Mariota & Co. as legitimate playoff contenders who now own a head-to-head tiebreaker over Denver. And the Titans get a shot at Houston at home in Week 17. The AFC South tiebreakers don\u2019t favor the Titans, but if they win out, they\u2019ll be division champs. They have road games in Kansas City and Jacksonville before the intra-division finale.", "Slipping: Sunday\u2019s game was something like a playoff for the Indianapolis Colts (6-7). Indy is in serious danger of missing the playoffs for the second season in a row. They're in third place in the AFC South, and they're 0-2 against the Texans.

I extend my warmest greetings to the members of the Swedish Academy and to all of the other distinguished guests in attendance tonight.", "I'm sorry I can't be with you in person, but please know that I am most definitely with you in spirit and honored to be receiving such a prestigious prize. Being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature is something I never could have imagined or seen coming. From an early age, I've been familiar with and reading and absorbing the works of those who were deemed worthy of such a distinction:\u00a0Kipling,\u00a0Shaw,\u00a0Thomas Mann,\u00a0Pearl Buck,\u00a0Albert Camus,\u00a0Hemingway. These giants of literature whose works are taught in the schoolroom, housed in libraries around the world and spoken of in reverent tones have always made a deep impression. That I now join the names on such a list is truly beyond words.", "I don't know if these men and women ever thought of the Nobel honor for themselves, but I suppose that anyone writing a book, or a poem, or a play anywhere in the world might harbor that secret dream deep down inside. It's probably buried so deep that they don't even know it's there.", "If someone had ever told me that I had the slightest chance of winning the Nobel Prize, I would have to think that I'd have about the same odds as standing on the moon. In fact, during the year I was born and for a few years after, there wasn't anyone in the\u00a0world\u00a0who was considered good enough to win this Nobel Prize. So, I recognize that I am in very rare company, to say the least.", "I was out on the road when I received this surprising news, and it took me more than a few minutes to properly process it. I began to think about William Shakespeare, the great literary figure. I would reckon he thought of himself as a dramatist. The thought that he was writing literature couldn't have entered his head. His words were written for the stage. Meant to be spoken not read. When he was writing Hamlet, I'm sure he was thinking about a lot of different things: \"Who're the right actors for these roles?\" \"How should this be staged?\" \"Do I really want to set this in Denmark?\" His creative vision and ambitions were no doubt at the forefront of his mind, but there were also more mundane matters to consider and deal with. \"Is the financing in place?\" \"Are there enough good seats for my patrons?\" \"Where am I going to get a human skull?\" I would bet that the farthest thing from Shakespeare's mind was the question \"Is this\u00a0literature?\"", "When I started writing songs as a teenager, and even as I started to achieve some renown for my abilities, my aspirations for these songs only went so far. I thought they could be heard in coffee houses or bars, maybe later in places like Carnegie Hall, the London Palladium. If I was really dreaming big, maybe I could imagine getting to make a record and then hearing my songs on the radio. That was really the big prize in my mind. Making records and hearing your songs on the radio meant that you were reaching a big audience and that you might get to keep doing what you had set out to do.", "Well, I've been doing what I set out to do for a long time, now. I've made dozens of records and played thousands of concerts all around the world. But it's my songs that are at the vital center of almost everything I do. They seemed to have found a place in the lives of many people throughout many different cultures and I'm grateful for that.", "But there's one thing I must say. As a performer I've played for 50,000 people and I've played for 50 people and I can tell you that it is harder to play for 50 people. 50,000 people have a singular persona, not so with 50. Each person has an individual, separate identity, a world unto themselves. They can perceive things more clearly. Your honesty and how it relates to the depth of your talent is tried. The fact that the Nobel committee is so small is not lost on me.", "But, like Shakespeare, I too am often occupied with the pursuit of my creative endeavors and dealing with all aspects of life's mundane matters. \"Who are the best musicians for these songs?\" \"Am I recording in the right studio?\" \"Is this song in the right key?\" Some things never change, even in 400 years.", "Not once have I ever had the time to ask myself, \"Are my songs\u00a0literature?\"", "So, I do thank the Swedish Academy, both for taking the time to consider that very question, and, ultimately, for providing such a wonderful answer.", "My best wishes to you all,", "Bob Dylan"], "targetTitle": "Read Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech in Full", "postTimestamp": "Sun Dec 11 00:28:04 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "", "targetDescription": "Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize in literature speech was delivered by United States Ambassador to Sweden Azita Raji."}

(Henry Wismayer)"], "targetParagraphs": ["Beside the temple on Swami Rock, amid the heady swirl of colorful deities and burning camphor, one object caught my eye. It seemed that a special reverence had been reserved for a statue of a holy cow. Centuries ago, a placard beside it explained, this Chola-era figurine had been buried by concerned priests as the Portuguese colonists sailed into harbor. There it had remained interred, through centuries of colonial occupation and decades of civil war. But in 2013 it was rediscovered and dusted off \u2014 returned to its Hindu shrine after almost 400 years. And as I watched the pilgrims queuing to leave offerings at its base, it seemed a fitting symbol for this part of Sri Lanka, where an air of resurrection is precisely what brought me here.", "Sri Lanka\u2019s east coast, running from Trincomalee in the north to the grasslands of Yala in the south, has good reason to feel optimistic about the future. Twelve years ago, when my partner Lucy visited the region on a teaching exchange, her minibus had to pass through dozens of army checkpoints to get anywhere near this region. The Tamil insurgency, which blighted Sri Lanka for nearly 30 years, made travel hazardous. A few months later, the east was devastated along with much of the south coast by the Boxing Day tsunami. The natural disaster claimed 40,000 lives on the island alone.", "Today, however, with the civil war ended and the tsunami a fading \u2014 still traumatic \u2014 memory, the east is finally opening up to tourism. While Sri Lanka\u2019s southwest coast starts to strain under the pressure of doubling tourist numbers and rapacious development, the resort\u2019s smattering of new resorts and improved road access have grown to offer a beguiling alternative. And so Lucy had come back, this time with me and our two young kids, following a growing number who are drawn toward the island\u2019s less-traveled coasts in pursuit of sanctuary.", "Keen to see how much has changed since those more turbulent days, and no less keen to recover from a hot seven-hour drive across the interior from the capital, Colombo, we started with something indulgent. Jungle Beach, in Kuchaveli, was the only hotel on its untamed stretch of coastline, but as limited choices go this presented little hardship. A 20-yard walk from our airy, teak-filled cabana, the beach felt remote and wild, its shallow curve backed by driftwood and scrubland. A cashew-shaped pool was sheltered from the sun by rambling trees; a fine restaurant served up wonders under whirring fans.", "At times, it felt like a place barely reclaimed from the nature that surrounded it. Wading birds swooped down to the poolside ponds to lance tiny fish from among the lotus flowers, spiny lizards sunned themselves on the trees and mouse deer roamed the grounds. Such wild diversions were nothing compared with the beasts that frequented the neighboring sea. Though the waters were too rough during our visit, this is one of many spots on the Sri Lankan coast where a boat trip promises sightings of blue whales.", "It was all too easy, lapping up the delights of Jungle Beach, to forget the backdrop of damage, both natural and man-made, during a trip to eastern Sri Lanka. But you didn\u2019t have to stray far for reminders. When I visited Nilaveli, the next bay south, the testaments were there \u2014 in the bullet-pocked wall of an abandoned house or a doleful concrete husk of what was once a beachside hotel, chafed to its foundations by the wave.", "With me on these excursions was driver Roobens, a local-born Tamil, an ethnicity he betrayed with his habit of swallowing the end of sentences with a head-waggle and a hail of words. Like many young Tamils, Roobens was forced to leave this area in the 1990s to avoid run-ins with a vengeful Sri Lankan army \u2014 \u201cI would have been arrested,\u201d he said matter-of-factly \u2014 but came back to Nilaveli in 2007, after the Tigers were pushed north. Like many here, Roobens now sees tourism as part of the region\u2019s rehabilitation.", "As we headed further south, his hopes found affirmation in scenes of human joy. It was Tamil New Year, holiday season, and everywhere we went we met Sri Lankan holidaymakers, many of them exploring the east coast of their country for the first time.", "The hot springs of Kanniya, where crowds thronged to anoint each other with bucketfuls of geothermal water from brick-lined wells, resembled nothing so much as a giant water-fight, and later, when we arrived in Trincomalee, eastern Sri Lanka\u2019s principal city, the whole population seemed to have decamped to Swami Rock, a giant headland just south of town.", "The rock\u2019s lower reaches are still dominated by Fort Frederick, a vast bastion built by Dutch colonists in the 1670s. But its ramparts, now home to an army barracks, also guarded one of the region\u2019s most holy Hindu temples. At the base of the fortress, an arched portico buzzed with tuktuks, and up on the point we found thousands of celebrants walking barefoot past gaudy puja stalls.", "From the pinnacle, looking past the worshipers milling about the temple, you could see northwest toward the town and the bay beyond, where a single tanker sat low in the water, hinting at the hidden depths that made it a key strategic harbor for British forces during World War II. But the view might have been very different were it not for Swami Rock. In 2004, when the tsunami thundered up the coast on its murderous rampage, the rock\u2019s sacred flanks blocked its path, saving Trincomalee from destruction and heeding a million prayers.", "A certain spell broke as we traveled south.", "It wasn\u2019t that our next stop, the village of Passikudah, which sprawled along a parabola of Indian Ocean coastline, didn\u2019t have its appeal. But where Kuchaveli had felt like a secret, this felt like a place in flux. Passikudah is one of Sri Lanka\u2019s 45 tourism-development zones, once-sleepy villages opened up to foreign investment as Sri Lanka looked to capitalize on the rush of foreign tourists that followed the end of the Tamil insurrection. However, these zones have proved controversial, seen by many as a way for former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brothers, dethroned and disgraced during democratic elections in 2015, to spread patronage among their cronies.", "It\u2019s hard to tell what the current government, elected on a promise to repudiate the corruption of the old regime, may mean for Passikudah. But for now, the area seemed yet to cross that line between popularity and overdevelopment. What resorts have been built were mostly unobtrusive, and the tourists drawn here responded in kind. Most of them, made supine by arrack cocktails and the prevailing air of lassitude, spent the day just slumbering and perspiring in the shade of flowering frangipani trees.", "Unlike the wild beach of Kuchaveli, which shelved steeply into the sea, Passikudah\u2019s coast was shallow, calm and much more populated, though this held charms of its own. At dusk, the southern end of the beach filled with Sri Lankan families, the water so stippled with splashing silhouettes as to resemble a holy river at puja time. When we went down with the kids to paddle, locals bombarded us with contagious smiles. And clucking women in saturated saris held out their arms to take the children in warm embraces, cradling them like holy objects for cellphone photos as the sun grew huge and red behind them.", "We headed south again, and while the landscape remained familiar the temperature continually rose. With my optimistic dreams of traveling by local bus derailed by the unforgiving heat, we descended the east coast in an air-conditioned taxi. While the family slept, I watched the east\u2019s central coast whiz by in a haze behind the car\u2019s tinted window. We passed griddles of salt pans, smallholdings of tobacco, and somnolent lagoons stained white and pink with flowering waterlilies. Even Batticaloa, the east\u2019s second city, seemed stunned into inertia by the sun, while on the outskirts the rice farmers plodded resolutely on, throwing handfuls of seeds across flooded paddies.", "Our destination, Arugam Bay, is a relatively old hand in eastern tourism. Its story dates back to the 1960s, when Australian drifters arrived in what was then a tiny Muslim village to find local children bodysurfing on perfect rip-curl waves. For five months from May, those same waves now lure surfers from all over the world.", "With our kids too young to surf, and the waves yet to rise in earnest, we spent the mornings seeking shade and the afternoons seeking adventure. Each day after lunch, we squeezed the whole family into the double back seat of a tuktuk and asked the mild-mannered drivers to take us out onto the rutted roads south of the village.", "We explored the coast, then delved inland, where wild elephants bathed in shimmering lagoons and crocodiles lurked among the lily pads in tanks, the huge reservoirs built as part of the great irrigation projects of Sinhalese kings. At the forest hermitage of Kudimbigala, we walked up steps cut into great boulders. At the summit, views over the forest, uninterrupted by modernity, stretched to the horizon.", "Change was always in the air, though, here in the east. A few years back, I learned from conversations with locals, one of the most idyllic beaches we visited, called Peanut Farm, had been annexed by the government despite local opposition. But the plan had been interrupted by the elections last year. The new government had returned it \u2014 now the local villagers were busy building a guesthouse of their own.", "For the time being, at least, the atmosphere that sets eastern Sri Lanka apart looks set to endure.", "Wismayer is a writer based in London.

At HP we call this Blended Reality, and we believe it will surpass the revolutions that came before in scale, scope and complexity. Connected factories, robotics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and 3D printing have the potential to disrupt and reinvent virtually every aspect of the $12 trillion manufacturing industry, unlocking unprecedented economic potential.  We estimate 3D printing will expand at a 30% compound annual growth rate to an $18 billion industry in 2021, with plastics being the largest portion of the market accounting for an estimated $10.4 billion. Even at $18 billion, that is a small fraction of the $12 trillion manufacturing industry.", "Major tech companies like GE, SAP, and HP are investing heavily in 3D printing, working toward the shared vision of cost-effective, precision quality, mass personalization for everyone, everywhere. As with past industrial revolutions    water and steam to mechanize production, electricity to create mass production, electronics and IT to automate production   digital manufacturing will change how humans work, live and relate to one another. It will require transformation involving all stakeholders from the global community, from the public and private sectors to academia and civil society.  All must adapt for the digital age.", "Reinventing the Workforce", "As we go through the fourth industrial revolution the global economy will undergo a major transformation.  The type and location of jobs will dramatically change.  According to the World Economic Forum, 65 percent of children today will grow up to work in jobs that don't exist yet, and almost 50 percent of the knowledge students acquire in the first year of a four-year technical degree will be outdated by the time they graduate. In past industrial revolutions we had the luxury of time to train and retrain workers. With the exponential rate of technological innovation, this is no longer the case.", "Education institutions at all levels need to adopt an inclusive growth mindset that embraces change.  New curriculums are needed that teach technological literacy, equipping students with the skills needed to succeed in this new era of digitally computer assisted design and manufacturing. Programming, technology- and user-experience design, and equipment operation and management will be valued skills, along with cognitive abilities like creativity and logical reasoning.", "This extends beyond the classroom. Needed skills will continue to evolve throughout a person's career. As more jobs are automated, employers must commit to providing their employees the tools and on-the-job access to learning that are necessary for future success.", "Reinventing Trade & the Taxation of Goods", "The taxation of goods and services is rooted in the physical movement of products. 3D printing disrupts this model. Instead of shipping tangible goods, companies will ship digital designs and raw materials, increasing production efficiency. Many products will be transported via digital files as ones and zeros, taking shape in a 3D printer at the destination. This shortens and localizes the supply chain while greatly reducing cross-border trade of goods.", "The shift from trading physical goods to digital files could render existing WTO goods-related agreements irrelevant, raising questions like: Does the transmission of these files need to be classified as an import or export? If so, which country should be taxed? As value shifts to the end of the supply chain, the potential for supply chain taxes decreases. Governments will have to make up for lost revenue in new ways, and businesses may need to think about maintaining the raw materials they need closer to the point of manufacture.", "Reinventing the Global Supply Chain & Sustainability", "Traditional supply chains involve shipping components and products back and forth across the globe, leaving a trail of carbon emissions in their wake. The on-demand nature of the fourth industrial revolution through new technologies like additive manufacturing and immersive computing makes supply chains more efficient. Digitizing the shipment of goods and producing finished products nearer the point of consumption promises to reduce carbon emissions.  On demand production eliminates production waste and saves energy. This works only if the 3D ecosystem agrees to use sustainable materials and methods along the entire supply chain.", "Every industrial revolution has required governments, businesses, and institutions to re-evaluate existing policies and procedures. The fourth industrial revolution is both different and the same, because it is both physical and digital. The global community must act quickly to keep pace with the unprecedented rate of technological innovation. All sectors of society must come together to ensure that our workforce, our economy, and our products are built for the new Blended Reality at the heart of Industry 4.0."], "targetTitle": "HP Inc.Voice: Three Ways To Reinvent For The Fourth Industrial Revolution", "postTimestamp": "Fri Dec 09 05:31:01 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "", "targetDescription": "Connected factories, robotics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and 3D printing have the potential to disrupt and reinvent virtually every aspect of the $12 trillion manufacturing industry, unlocking unprecedented economic potential."}

Mr. Glenn, who in his post-NASA career served four terms as a U.S. senator from Ohio, was 95. The death was confirmed by Hank Wilson, commu", "ications director at the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at Ohio State University. Mr. Glenn had a stroke after heart-valve replacement surgery in 2014, but the immediate cause was not announced. Mr. Glenn was one of the seven original astronauts in NASA\u2019s Mercury program, which was a conspicuous symbol of the country\u2019s military and technological might at the height of the Cold War. He was not the first American in space \u2014 two of his fellow astro", "auts preceded him \u2014 but his three-orbit circumnavigation of the globe captured the imagination of his compatriots like few events before or since. Mr. Glenn was the last survivor of the Mercury Seven. \u201cJohn", "always had the right stuff,\u201d President Obama said in a statement, adding that Mr. Glenn \u201creminded us that with courage and a spirit of discovery there\u2019s no limit to the heights we can reach together.\u201d In an era when fear of encroaching Soviet influence reached from the White House to kindergarten classrooms, Mr. Glenn, ", "n his silver astronaut suit, lifted the hopes of a nation on his shining shoulders. When he emerged smiling from his Friendship 7 capsule after returning from space, cheers echoed throughout the land. \u201cYou had to have been alive at that time to comprehend the reaction of the nation, practically all of it,\u201d author Tom W", "lfe, who coined the phrase \u201cthe right stuff\u201d to describe Mr. Glenn and the other Mercury astronauts, wrote in a 2009 essay. \u201cJohn Glenn, in 1962, was the last true national hero America has ever had.\u201d After he was elected to the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1974, Mr. Glenn served on Capitol Hill for 24 years and made a halfhearted run for the Democratic", "presidential nomination in 1984. When he was 77 and completing his fourth Senate term in 1998, he had one final flight of glory, returning to space", "as a crew member aboard the space shuttle Discovery. As heroes go, the freckle-faced Mr. Glenn appeared unassuming and seemed to embody the middle-American values of modesty, steadiness and hard work. He had climbed the ranks of the Marine Corps by accepting the most dangerous assignments ", "nd never flinching under pressure. He flew 149 combat missions in two wars and was a test pilot in the 1950s, when faster-than-sound airplanes often veered out of control and crashed in smoking heaps. When he joined the a", "tronaut corps in 1959, no one knew whether a human being could survive the ordeals of space travel. Yet for all the risks he faced, Mr. Glenn was a man of careful preparation and quiet responsibility. On Oct.\u00a04, 1957, the Soviet Union made a bold advance on the Cold War chessboard by launching Sputnik, th", " first man-made satellite to orbit Earth. In response, the U.S. government formed NASA in 1958 amid widespread fear that the country was falling behind the Soviets in technology and military strength. Of the seven original astronauts of the Mercury program \u2014 the others were M. Scott Carpenter, L. Gordon Cooper Jr., Virgil I. \u201cGus\u201d Grissom, Walter M. \u201cWally\u201d Schirra Jr., Alan B. Shepard Jr. and Donald", "K. \u201cDeke\u201d Slayton \u2014 Mr. Glenn was the oldest and the lone Marine. A lieutenant colonel at the time \u2014 who ultimately became a full colonel \u2014 he also had the highest rank and the most combat experience. He did not drink, smoke or swear and maintained a disciplined, straight-arrow manner while training in Cocoa Beach, Fla., near NASA\u2019s space center at Cape Canaveral. Comfortable in", "front of cameras \u2014 which followed the astronauts everywhere after they signed a $500,000 deal with Life magazine for a series of exclusive stories \u2014 Mr. Glenn was in many ways the public face of NASA. Privately, however, there was friction among the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d as the Mercury astronauts were dubbed in the news media. Concerned that some of his ", "olleagues\u2019 dalliances with women could lead to bad publicity and jeopardize the manned space program, Mr. Glenn confronted his fellow astronauts, admonishing them to avoid any semblance of wro", "gdoing. \u201cThere was no doubt whatsoever that Glenn meant every word of it,\u201d Wolfe wrote in his 1979 book, \u201cThe Right Stuff.\u201d \u201cW", "en he got his back up, he was formidable. He was not to be trifled with.\u201d Not all of the astronauts were pleased with Mr. Glenn\u2019s righteousness, however, and She", "ard told him to mind his own business. \u201cHis moralizing led to colorful and heated exchanges among the pilots, and it was", "\u2019t pleasant banter,\u201d Shepard and Slayton wrote in their 1995 book, \u201cMoon Shot.\u201d When the astronauts voted among themselves to confer the honor of being the first American in space, they chose She", "ard. On May\u00a05, 1961, Shepard had a 15-minute suborbital space flight, followed two months later by Grissom on a similar mission. But two Soviet cosmonauts had already circled the Earth by August 1961. Mr. Glenn\u2019s turn came", "on Feb.\u00a020, 1962. After 11 delays because of bad weather or faulty equipment, he sat in his tiny space capsule, the Friendship 7,", "atop an MA-6 rocket that had failed in 40\u00a0percent of its test flights. After liftoff at 9:47\u00a0a.m., backup pilot Carpenter said on an internal tape la", "er released to the public, \u201cGodspeed, John Glenn.\u201d The moment was shared by practically the entire nation, as a television audience of 135\u00a0million \u2014 the largest up to that time \u2014 witnessed the launch. After the first of three s", "heduled orbits, the capsule began to wobble. Mr. Glenn overrode the automatic navigation system and piloted Friendship 7 with manual controls, reaching a height of 162\u00a0miles above the Earth\u2019s surface. Midway through the flight, a warning light indicated that the heat shield, which would p", "otect the capsule during its reentry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, might have come loose. Without a heat shield, it was possible that Mr. Glenn could burn up inside the capsule as it raced back from space", " As Friendship 7 was descending, all radio contact was lost. Shepard, acting as \u201ccapsule communicator\u201d from ", "ape Canaveral, tried to reach Mr. G", "enn in his spacecraft, saying, \u201cHow do you read? Over.\u201d After about 4 minutes and 20 seconds of sil", "nce, Mr. Glenn could finally be heard: \u201cLoud and clear. How me?\u201d \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Shepard asked. \u201cOh, pretty good,\u201d Mr. Glenn casually responded, later adding, \u201cbut that was a real fireball, boy.\u201d Exterior pieces of the capsule\u2019s had broken off during reentry", "and burst into flame. A defective warning light caused much of the panic, but during those four tense minutes, it was feared that Mr. Glenn had been lost \u2014 along with the prom", "se of the space program. When he splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean after 4 hours 56 minutes aloft, Mr. Glenn emerged as an almost mythic figure who had scaled heights no American had reached before. \u201cI was fully aware of the danger,\u201d he said ", "n 1968. \u201cNo matter what preparation you make, there comes the moment of truth. You're playing with big stakes \u2014 your life. But the important thing to me wasn\u2019t fear but what you can do to control it.\u201d He was greeted upon his return by President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B", " Johnson. After an estimated 1\u00a0million spectators crowded the streets of Washington, Mr. Glenn insisted that the other six Mercury astro", "auts join him for a parade before 4\u00a0million people in New York. \u201cDuring his ticker-tape parade up Broadway,\u201d Wolfe wrote, \u201cyou have never heard such cheers or seen so many thousands of people crying.\u201d John Herschel Glenn Jr.", "was born July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, and grew up in New Concord, Ohio. His father ran a plumbing supply business and later had a Chevrolet dealership. His mother taught at an elem", "ntary school. Mr. Glenn was an honor student in high school, lettered in three sports and played trumpet in the band. At Muskingum College in New Concord, he was a reserve center on the football team. He took flying lessons in his teens and left college ", "arly in 1942 to enter a Navy pilot training program before transferring to the aviation branch of the Marine Corps. On April 6, 1943, he married Anna \u201cAnnie\u201d Castor, whom he had known since childhood. During World War II, Mr. Glenn flew 59 missions as a fighte", " pilot and took part in the Marshall Islands campaign in the Pacific. He was stationed on Guam in the Western Pacific and was a flight instructor in Texas before returning to action in the Korean War. He", "was in the same squadron in Korea as baseball star Ted Williams and flew 90 missions as a jet fighter pilot. He once returned with more than 200 holes shot through the fuselage and wings of his plan", ". Attached to an Air Force unit, Mr. Glenn shot down three Soviet-made MiGs during the final nine days of the war in 1953, leading his crew to paint \u201cMiG Mad Marine\u201d on the side of his F-86 Sabre jet. After Korea, Mr", " Glenn was a test pilot at the naval air station at Patuxent River, Md., and set a transcontinental speed record on July\u00a016, 1957, by flying an F8U-1 Crusader jet coast to coast in 3\u00a0hours 23\u00a0minutes. He worked at the Navy\u2019s Bureau of Aeronautics and eventually was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree by Muskin", "um. He also found time in 1957 to appear on the game show \u201cName That Tune\u201d with child actor Eddie Hodges. They split $25,000 in prize money, which was more than Mr. Glenn\u2019s annual pay as a test pilot. When NASA began recruiting a team of astronauts, it soug", "t skilled pilots who could withstand rigorous physical and psychological testing and who \u2014 to fit into cramped space capsules \u2014 were shorter than 5 feet 11 inches tall. (Mr. Glenn was 5-foot-101 / 2.) With their courage and know-how", " the Mercury astronauts embodied the spirit of the \u201cNew Frontier\u201d espoused by Kennedy, and Mr. Glenn became friends with the youthful president and his brother Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general. Encouraged by the Kennedy family, Mr. Glenn resigned from the astronaut corps in 1964 to run for the U.S. Senate in Ohio. He dropped out after slipping on a rug and striking his hea", " on a bathtub, resulting in inner-ear problems that required extensive medical treatment. In 1965, he retired from the Marine Corps, having received six Distinguished Flying Crosses and 19 Air Medals. He then b", "came an executive with Royal Crown Cola, invested in real estate and worked with a management company that operated Holiday Inns, particularly around Orlando. Within a few years, he was a millionaire. Mr. Glenn stayed close to the Kennedys and was at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles when Robert Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968. He ", "ccompanied five of Kennedy\u2019s 10 children (an 11th was born after his death) back to their home in McLean, Va. The next morning, Mr. Glenn informed the other children that their father had been killed. \u201cWhen Bob died, ", " had to sit on the edge of the bed as each child was waking up and tell them their dad was not coming home,\u201d Mr. Glenn told a Muskingum audience in 1997. \u201cIt was one of the hardest things I ever did.\u201d He was a pallbearer at Robert Kennedy\u2019s funeral at Arlington National Cemeter", " and handed the flag from the coffin to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). Soon afterward, Mr. Glenn helped organize a group that successfully lobbied for passage of a national gun control act in 1968. Making a second bid for the Senate in 1970, Mr. Glenn ", "alled for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, but he lost the Democratic primary in Ohio to businessman Howard M. Metzenbaum. Then-Rep. Robert Taft Jr., a Republican, won the general election. Early in 1974, Metzenbaum was appointed to the", "Senate to fill the expiring term of William B. Saxbe, who resigned to become U.S. attorney general. When Metzenbaum ran for a full Senate term that year, Mr. Glenn challenged him again in the primary. At a time when the military was unpopular, Metzenbaum repeatedly ", "alled Mr. Glenn \u201ccolonel\u201d and questioned his ability as a leader, saying he had never \u201cmet a payroll.\u201d", "The comment was widely seen as an insult, insinuating that Mr. Glenn had never held a \u201creal\u201d job. In a debate with Metzenbaum, the retired Marine flashed the steel beneath his benig", " Midwestern smile. \u201cI served 23\u00a0years in the United States Marine Corps,\u201d Mr. Glenn said. \u201cI was through two wars. I flew 149 missions. My plane was hit by antiaircraft fire on 12 different occasions. \u201cI was in the space program. It wasn\u2019t my ", "heckbook, it was my life that was on the line. . . .

And their self-sacrifice is what has made this country possible. \u201cI have held a job, Howard.\u201d The powerful \u201cGold Star Mother\u201d speech, recognizing families that had lost children in foreign wars, quickly turned the polls in Mr. Glenn\u2019s favor. He defeated Metzenbaum in the prim", "ry and then easily won the November general election, sweeping all of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties. Reelected in 1980, 1986 and 1992, Mr. Glenn was the first senator from Ohio to win four consecutive elections. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Glenn was a strong su", "porter of the military and an authority on intelligence issues. He supported a woman\u2019s right to abortion and was an advocate of campaign finance reform, national health insurance and medical research. He sponsored bills to improve the safety", "of nursing homes, reduce government paperwork and limit nuclear proliferation. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee from 1988 to 1994, he helped create the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Snyder said investigators are looking at anything electrical on the first floor of the warehouse near where the fire started.", "Record searches and interviews by The Associated Press indicate that the couple who leased the warehouse and turned it into living spaces and artists\u2019 studios, Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison, were already under scrutiny by several agencies. Some of those agencies had been told or could have seen for themselves that the family of five and their dozens of artist tenants were living in a warehouse that had no permit to operate as a living space and allegedly had no proper kitchen, electricity, adequate fire exits or solid stairs.\u00a0", "Almena, 46, is on probation for receiving stolen property, an Airstream trailer he was accused of stealing and stashing at the warehouse. The terms of his probation allowed authorities to enter his home to search without a warrant, records show. Child welfare workers had taken away the couple\u2019s three children in mid-2015 but returned them by this past summer, despite the illegal conditions at the warehouse and the children being hungry, infested with lice and frequently truant, Micah Allison\u2019s father and other acquaintances said. Almena confirmed in a 2015 document that child welfare workers visited the warehouse at least twice. Child welfare authorities refused to comment on the family, citing privacy laws. In returning the children, the authorities set certain conditions, including that the youngsters be out of the warehouse during the many parties held there, according to those who knew the couple. On the night of the fire, Allison and the three children had checked into an Oakland hotel, according to Almena. All of them survived. Almena said in a TV interview that he had little involvement in the party and had gone to the hotel as well.\u00a0", "Almena told the \u201cToday Show\u201d on Tuesday that he was \u201cincredibly sorry.\u201d \u00a0", "Almena said he started the community in the warehouse as a dream for the arts and performing arts, but, he said, sometimes \u201cyour dream is bigger than your pocketbook.\u201d", "He said he signed a lease for the building that \u201cwas to city standards supposedly.\u201d", "Almena said he lived in the warehouse with his family and other residents, but said he didn\u2019t make a profit.

City officials sent a violation notice for the first complaint and opened an investigation for the second one. Darin Ranelletti, interim city building chief, told reporters an inspector went to the Ghost Ship on Nov. 17 to follow up on the complaint. But the inspector was unable to enter the building or talk to occupants, and left, Ranelliti said. City officials would not give further details. Allison\u2019s father, Michael Allison, said he is left wondering why officials failed to take quicker, tougher action. \u201cThis whole thing, the city giving them warning after warning after warning, strikes me as bizarre. It\u2019s been going on for years,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew something was going to happen ... but not this.\u201d\u00a0", "Under state and city law, commercial buildings must receive annual fire inspections. Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ray Kelly refused to say whether fire officials had visited the warehouse before the blaze. Zac Unger, vice president of the Oakland firefighters union, said the city has about one-third of the fire inspectors of other cities of comparable size. \u201cIt\u2019s a systematic underinvestment in the fire department and a roll of the dice, hoping they\u2019ll get away with it,\u201d he said. Noel Gallo, a city councilman who lives a block away and recalled fruitless conversations with Almena over trash and other nuisances, said he will push for more building inspectors and fire marshals.", "Hundreds gathered at an Oakland vigil Monday night to remember the victims of the warehouse fire. Thirty-six people were killed in the \"Ghost Shi...", "\u00a0But Gallo noted the city has many occupied warehouses and has to be mindful of the \u201cdesperate\u201d housing shortage in the San Francisco Bay area, where the tech boom has driven up prices and rents.\u00a0", "In an interview after the fire, Almena said police also had been in and out of the buildings for years, over thefts and other complaints from the people there. \u201cThey would come in and they would walk through our space and they\u2019d always say \u2018Wow, what an amazing space,\u2019\u201d Almena told San Jose TV station KNTV."], "targetTitle": "Could authorities have prevented the tragic Oakland warehouse fire?", "postTimestamp": "Wed Dec 07 00:10:01 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "oakland warehouse fire, Warehouse fire, oakland ghost ship warehouse fire, oakland", "targetDescription": "Did authorities miss signs to prevent the tragic fire at the Oakland &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; warehouse?"}

In moist locations, rising temperatures tend to cause an increase in extreme precipitation, while the opposite can be true in drier places. In general, there tends to be a \u201csweet spot\u201d in terms of the temperature that produces the most extreme precipitation events on average in the United States, Prein said \u2014 currently, it\u2019s about 80 degrees Fahrenheit.", "But, he noted, the study suggests that \u201cin the future climate, storms keep on intensifying up to something like 87 or 88 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201d", "This is because under future climate change, many parts of the nation will become both warmer and wetter. As a result, much of the country will see an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events. This is especially true for parts of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, as well as some mountain regions like the Rockies, where humidity is high to begin with. \u00a0", "On average across the U.S., extreme precipitation events may become nearly three times more likely, according to Prein. And at highest, their frequency may increase five-fold in some locations. One way to think about this is to imagine the most intense storm of the summer, Prein said. In the future, a storm of that magnitude might occur five times in a season instead of just once.", "The researchers expect the intensity of these events, or the amount of precipitation they produce, to spike as well \u2014 by as much as 70 percent in some cases. This means a storm that produced three inches of rain in the past, for example, might produce more than five inches in the future.", "This could be a problem for communities across the country in the future, who may need to start thinking about updating their infrastructure to deal with a future uptick in extreme storms. But there\u2019s still hope: The new study relies on a business-as-usual scenario, meaning a situation in which current warming rates continue unabated into the future. With a serious effort at cutting greenhouse gas emissions and slowing the progression of climate change, these situations could still be avoided.", "So the new study serves as a warning of what could happen in the future, but not necessarily a definite forecast.", "\u201cIf we can manage to level out temperature increases at a lower rate than what we see here\u2026then the consequences will be less,\u201d Prein said."], "targetTitle": "Extreme rainfall risks could triple in the U.S. under climate change, scientists warn", "postTimestamp": "Tue Dec 06 03:30:06 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "Post Keywords", "targetDescription": ""}

The result has the potential to stoke market turmoil, widen bond spreads and depress the growth outlook, and so throw a spanner in the works of a finely calibrated monetary mechanism.", "Draghi\u2019s Governing Council is considering whether to adjust and extend QE so that it can keep going in tight bond markets as long as needed to achieve its inflation goal, with a decision due Thursday. The task of sustaining the recovery would have been easier had the euro area\u2019s third-largest economy been able to give itself a boost in the shape of an accelerated reform program; now the ECB may instead have to return to firefighting duties in financial markets.", "\u201cItaly has missed a splendid opportunity to reform its political system and streamline its public administration,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London. \u201cThe heightened uncertainty strengthens the case for the ECB to announce this Thursday an extension of its full asset-purchase program of 80 billion euros per month beyond March 2017.\u201d", "A spokesman for the ECB declined to comment, though Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny warned against drawing premature conclusions.", "\u201cThe European Central Bank has the task of making monetary policy for the entire euro area, not for a single country,\u201d he told reporters in Vienna, adding that Italian government bond yields have risen, but their level is not \u201calarming.\u201d", "The yield on Italian 10-year bonds was up 13 basis points at 2.035 percent at 1:14 p.m. Rome time. The euro slid as much as 1.5 percent before recovering to trade 0.4 percent higher at $1.0703.", "Structural adjustments intended to boost the region\u2019s growth potential are seen by the central bank as a vital counterpart to monetary support, and Italy, with stagnant productivity and a banking sector saddled with soured loans, is a chief candidate for reform. The ECB may now find itself having to support the economy more, or for longer.", "According to a Bloomberg survey of economists before the vote, Draghi will\u00a0 announce an extension of asset purchases on Thursday at the current pace. Most respondents also said that the scenario of slowly accelerating inflation and a moderate but steady recovery will give him room to start tapering by late 2017.", "The scale of Renzi\u2019s loss may now endanger that scenario. The vote caps a year of political upheavals in the European Union, including the decision by the U.K. six months ago to leave the bloc. As then, ECB officials are likely to stress their ability to manage liquidity shortages in the bloc\u2019s financial system while playing down the need for any larger interventions, such as a repeat of the 2011 expansion of the central bank\u2019s first government bond-buying program to rein in soaring Italian yields.", "\u201cThe referendum in Italy yesterday may be deemed as another source of uncertainty,\u201d ECB Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in a speech on Monday in Tokyo. \u201cHowever it cannot be compared to the British referendum: Italian people have been called to the polls to vote on an internal constitutional matter, and not about Italy\u2019s long-standing EU membership. We will nevertheless look closely at its consequences.\u201d", "In June, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, central banks around the world including the ECB offered the financial system fresh funds, and some even intervened in currency markets, to prevent investor unease spiraling out of control. Then, global markets mostly calmed after some initial volatility.", "\u201cPolitical uncertainty is dominant,\u201d ECB President Mario Draghi said in an interview with El Pais published last week. \u201cSo far we\u2019ve seen that in the short-term the response to these uncertainties has been more muted than people expected.\u201d", "While the ECB may be on top of any initial turmoil, it can do less about the hit to longer-term growth expectations that political paralysis in Italy may bring. The economy there has barely grown since entering the euro, and output per head is below the level before the single currency was introduced. The Italian statistics agency Istat forecast in November an expansion of 0.8 percent in 2016 and 0.9 percent next year.", "If Italy\u2019s growth is hobbled further, that bodes ill for the ECB\u2019s own outlook for the euro area. Fresh forecasts are due to be presented at the policy meeting that culminates on Dec. 8, and which will serve as the basis for the decision on QE.", "The referendum also has the prospect to deepen the crisis in Italy\u2019s banking sector, which under the weight of around 360 billion euros in non-performing loans and weak profitability has seen an investor sell-off this year. That outcome also falls at the ECB\u2019s door, as the central bank is responsible for euro-area banking supervision, and, if needed, triggering resolution proceedings.", "Bondholders of the country\u2019s third-largest lender, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, last week agreed to swap more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of subordinated notes for shares, making it easier for the bank to complete a vital 5 billion-euro capital increase by the end of the year. That, too, may now be at risk. Monte Paschi shares slid as much as 7.5 percent.", "\u201cRenzi had brought some hope that Italy would finally be embarking on a path of real economic reforms, but these hopes have now been dashed,\u201d\u00a0Jan von Gerich, global fixed income strategist at Nordea Bank in Helsinki, said in a note to clients. If Draghi doesn\u2019t seem willing to use the bond-buying program now to contain Italian yields if needed, \u201cit would dent confidence in the central bank\u2019s ability to control the bond markets,\u201d he said."], "targetTitle": "Renzi\u2019s Italian Fate Also Overshadows Draghi\u2019s Route for QE", "postTimestamp": "Mon Dec 05 08:34:07 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "markets,world", "targetDescription": "Matteo Renzi might not be the only person this week to have his plans thrown up in the air by the Italian electorate."}

James Mattis at the Trump International Golf Club, in Bedminster Township, N.J., on Nov. 19. (Pool Photo by Aude Guerrucci/European Pressphoto Agency)"], "targetParagraphs": ["NEWS THAT retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis will be nominated as defense secretary prompted a chorus of hosannas from his fellow former officers and the military analyst community. A studious but tough leader who led some of the hardest fighting the United States has done in Iraq and Afghanistan, and who served as overall commander of the Middle East region, Mr.\u00a0Mattis \u201cis one of the best-regarded generals in the modern history of the Marine Corps,\u201d according to military historian Max Boot. Mostly left unsaid in such encomiums was the hope that a man Donald Trump called \u201ca true general\u2019s general\u201d will steady the incoming president, whom Mr. Mattis already appears to have persuaded to reconsider the value of torture.", "This is not to suggest that the Senate should quickly set aside concerns about appointing a recently retired general officer to head the Defense Department. Since 1947, such appointments have been proscribed; currently ex-generals must have been out of service at least eight years to be eligible, while Mr.\u00a0Mattis retired only in 2013. This is more than an issue of protocol: The principle of civilian control over the military is fundamental to U.S. democracy. So is the idea that the officer corps will remain outside of partisan politics.", "Mr. Trump has already dented these norms by appointing as his national security adviser former Lt.\u00a0Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who after being pushed out of his post at the Defense Intelligence Agency became a bitter adversary of both the Obama administration and the Pentagon brass. Though he never emulated Mr. Flynn\u2019s open partisanship, Mr. Mattis, too, is known to have differed with the Obama White House over Iran policy; it has been reported that his term as chief of Central Command was shortened as a result.", "Two other former generals and an admiral are said to be on Mr. Trump\u2019s short lists for national-security-related Cabinet positions. That creates the disturbing potential for an administration dominated by ex- men, including several who in one way or another differed with the previous president. No one should welcome such a blurring of the boundaries between the U.S. military and civilian spheres.", "That said, there is a tradition of former generals, such as Brent Scowcroft or Colin Powell, serving presidents with honor, and the Senate set a precedent for waiving the defense rule when it approved George C. Marshall for the secretary\u2019s job in 1950. The extreme circumstances of the Trump presidency-to-be \u2014 including a commander in chief who is both ignorant of military and international affairs and prone to impulsiveness \u2014 strengthen the case for a Mattis exception.", "Though a hawk on Iran \u2014 like Mr. Flynn and other incoming national security officials \u2014 Mr. Mattis wisely believes \u201cthere is no going back\u201d on the nuclear agreement with Tehran and that it should be enforced rather than abruptly discarded. As a former senior official at NATO, he might be expected to resist any steps that would dismantle or damage the alliance, or discount the threat posed by Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s Russia.", "Like a number of former chiefs of Central Command, Mr. Mattis empathizes, perhaps excessively, with former clients such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates; he also absorbed the tired view that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Israeli settlement construction in particular, are central to the Middle East\u2019s troubles. Like all of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security appointees thus far, he appears to have scant experience of Asia or other regions outside the Middle East and Europe.

Whatever a person's opinions about the substance of these protests or whether his actions or those of a few other players have factored into the lower NFL ratings for this season or not, the league faces a delicate tradeoff. It must balance the presentation of its brand against the appearance of bullying players on a sensitive matter involving race.", "It's certainly not unreasonable for the NFL, or any employer, to discourage political or socially controversial displays or actions by employees that create conflict between employees or that influence consumer perception of the product. In fact, it would be ludicrous to permit workers to slap Trump or Hilary stickers or any other symbol of political or social support or protest on to Mrs. Smith's pies as they shipped. The peaceful but highly visible and controversial displays of players personal views on social issues during a football game may not be exactly equivalent, but they are similar. Furthermore, with the multi-million dollar salaries of so many professional athletes, league limits on personal expression on-the-job are hardly the man squashing the little guy.", "Outside of the context of political or social protests, the NFL goes to some length in bounding player expressions that the league feels negatively impacts its product in the eyes of consumers. Touchdown celebrations are circumscribed. The league does not permit personalization of uniforms or gestures like throat slashing that are deemed demeaning or incendiary.  In response to off-the-field behavior and its possible impact, the NFL (and other leagues) have adopted personal conduct codes.", "Of course, some of these limitations have their critics, including those among the media who see the league as too controlling.  The Chicago Bears' Jim McMahon famously pushed against Pete Rozelle and found many writers willing to back his fairly childish antics because, after all, he was bucking the big bad league. Additionally, players consistently push out the boundaries in a game of well if I can't do that, you didn't say I can't do this whether it is choreographing faux phone calls or punching the goal post.", " Colin Kaepernick #7 and two teammates kneel in protest during the national anthem prior to their NFL game against Tampa Bay Buccaneers on October 23, 2016. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images)", "In spite of these criticisms and whether the league draws the line in just the right place, the NFL and other leagues are not out of bounds in trying to manage the behavior of players in ways that directly determine and reflect on its product. Sports leagues don't exist in a vacuum. Fan preferences matter. If games are too long or boring or player actions are detract from fan enjoyment, the league has an interest. Ultimately, its not the analyst on ESPN, the New York Times writer, or a blogger like me that matters, but fan preferences that drive long run revenues for the league as well as player salaries. Freedom of speech has limits when on-the-job.", "But, the league does not exist in a social vacuum either. While there are parallels between limits placed on things like touchdown celebrations and protests of social or public policy, the fact that these protests involve issues of racial discrimination put them in a special category. If the league comes down on them, it can be perceived as being supporting the objects of protests -- the oppressors. While bearing some similarity to Jim McMahon's complaints, its a much more serious social issue. And, its where the analyst on ESPN, the New York Times, and other media outlets have a big and influential voice.", "The NFL can take no action and hope these protests lose steam. If they don't, or, more problematic, these protests encourage additional player ones on this issue or other issues, then the league is almost forced into some action. Consumers will notice and respond, and acrimony between players and fans bubbling up is not a positive. Bringing the Players Association in and trying to arrive at a mutually agreeable solution might be the best course of action.", "One aspect of these specific issue is that the playing of the national anthem carries with it something of a political statement. If the practice were not already in place, I would not be a big supporter of initiating it. It's not that I'm anti-America, but, if nothing else, as sports contests have become more and more common, the practice has become mechanical and devoid of much meaning. Playing it exclusively at the Super Bowl would actually elevate it.

Inside, the nearly 2500 sq. ft. includes three bedrooms and four bathrooms. Despite a recent redesign that some realtors described as \u201csophisticated,\u201d Franklin is planning to redo the interiors to match its sitcom heritage, making it appear as if the Tanner family really lives there.", "\u201cThe house came on the market and really, I just thought, I have to buy this house,\u201d Franklin told The Hollywood Reporter during a telephone interview from San Francisco on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m so sentimental about the house. It\u2019s great to have the house in our Full Housefamily and be able to preserve it for the fans. \u2026 Seriously, I love owning this house.\u201d", "Another thing he loves: The property now has a red door once again. The previous owners painted it a seafoam green color, but Franklin made the change one of his first orders of new homeowner business, a detail that will surely please fans \u2014 many of which still flock there on a daily basis for photo ops. \u201cThere are probably 250 fans per day that show up and take a picture in front of it,\u201d Franklin noted. \u201cIt will be a lot more fun for the fans because now the house will look like the Tanners really live there. It\u2019s a gift to the fans but it\u2019s also fun for me to own it.\u201d", "But they better hurry because the red door will take a temporary hiatus. \u201cI need to do some construction work on the inside, and do a seismic retrofit so the building is safe. It still has the original, brick foundation from 1883, and the whole house needs to be brought up to code,\u201d\u00a0Franklin explained. \u201cThat will probably be six months of construction and during that time, the red door will not be there because I don\u2019t want it to get ruined.\u201d", "Franklin recalled that he picked that particular home after a location manager visited San Francisco to select options for the Tanner family residence before they started shooting in early 1987. \u201cI wanted the family to live in one of those classic Victorian homes,\u201d he added. \u201cFor some reason, that one jumped out at me. There were lots of candidates but that was the winner.\u201d", "Franklin laughed that they paid a \u201cridiculous\u201d amount, \u201clike $500,\u201d to shoot a bunch of shots of the home \u2014 everything from lights on, lights off, daytime and nighttime \u2014 so they would have options moving forward. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to go back there until several years later, but by that point the owner, I guess, had become annoyed with fans coming by and they weren\u2019t in a cooperative mood,\u201d he said. Subsequent owners also were frustrated living inside a tourist magnet.", "Because of that, Franklin said that \u201cno one has allowed us to shoot in that house since we did our very first stock shoot back in April of \u201987. Our audience has watched the same cars drive by that house now for 29 years. It\u2019s going to be really nice to see some new cars drive by the house.\u201d", "As the new owner, Franklin is looking toward making the home a part of the new incarnation of the show, Fuller House, which streams on Netflix. The reboot debuted in February and a second season is prepped and ready to roll out on Dec. 9. He is hoping to hear from Netflix shortly about a season three renewal, giving them an option to shoot in and around the home.", "\u201cWe would take advantage of the fact that I now own the house, and we could go up there and shoot some new footage and maybe bring the cast up and shoot with them up there,\u201d he said, adding that he also plans to take advantage of the show\u2019s upcoming anniversary, albeit in a more private way.", "Full House premiered on Sept. 22, 1987, making Sept. 22, 2017, the show\u2019s 30th anniversary. \u201cThat will be around the time that all of my construction will be done so I hope to bring the cast up to the house and have a big slumber party here so people can drive by and actually see the Tanner family living there for one whole day,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat would be pretty fun.\u201d", "By then too, the red door will be back and the landscaping and window treatments will match the looks from the sitcom, said L.A. native Franklin, who owns only one other home, his permanent residence in Los Angeles. Up first though, are a series of fan events staring in San Francisco this week and continuing on to Tokyo, where he said the reboot has been a huge hit.", "In addition to some filming and fun cast events, Franklin does have an eye to rent out the property to the public. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame to let it sit empty,\u201d he says. \u201cI will be renting it out but I\u2019m not sure yet what, where, when or how.

Among them were cool kids who looked like cool kids the world over, tuned in to that teenage frequency, a dog whistle with global reach. I noticed that white was a popular color. White slouchy, pegged jeans, white polo shirts, white high-tops. Maybe white has extra status in a place where many roads are unpaved and turn to mud, where garbage is everywhere, literally, and where water shortages make it exceedingly difficult to keep people and clothing clean.", "So few nonresidents enter Shuafat that my appearance there seemed to be a highly unusual event, met with warm greetings verging on hysteria, crowds of kids following along. \u201cHello, America!\u201d they called excitedly. I was a novelty, but also, I was with Baha Nababta, a 29-year-old Palestinian community organizer beloved by the kids of Shuafat. Those who followed us wanted not just my attention but his. Baha had a rare kind of charisma. Camp-counselor charisma, you might call it. He was a natural leader of boys. Every kid we passed knew him and either waved or stopped to speak to him. Baha founded a community center so that older children would have a place to hang out, because there is no open space in Shuafat Refugee Camp, no park, not a single playground, nowhere for kids to go, not even a street, really, where they can play, because there are no sidewalks, most of the narrow roads barely fitting the cars that ramble down them. Youngers kids tapped me on the arms and wanted to show me the mural they painted with Baha. The road they helped to pave with Baha, who supervised its completion. The plants they planted with Baha along a narrow strip. Baha, Baha, Baha.", "It was like that with the adults too. They all wanted his attention. His phone was blowing up in his pocket as we walked. He finally answered. There was a dispute between a man whose baby died at a clinic and the doctor who treated the baby. The man whose baby died tried to burn the doctor alive, and now the doctor was in critical condition, in a hospital in Jerusalem. Throughout the two days I spent with Baha, I heard more stories like this that he was asked to help resolve. People relied on him. He had a vision for the Shuafat camp, where he was born and raised, that went beyond what could be imagined from within the very limited confines of the place.", "In an area of high-rise apartment buildings clustered around a mosque with spindly, futuristic minarets, a pudgy boy of 10 or 11 called over to us. \u201cMy dad is trying to reach you,\u201d he said to Baha. Baha told me that the buildings in that part of the camp had no water and that everyone was contacting him about it. He had not been answering his phone, he confessed, because he didn\u2019t have any good news yet for the residents. I got the impression Baha was something like an informal mayor, on whom people depended to resolve disputes, build roads, put together volunteer committees and try to make Shuafat safe for children.", "Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.", "The building next to us was 12 stories. Next to it was another 12-story building. High-rise apartments in the camp are built so close together that if a fire should happen, the results would be devastating. There would be no way to put it out. The buildings were all built of stone blocks that featured, between blocks, wooden wedges that stuck out intermittently, as if the builders had never returned to fill the gaps with mortar. I gazed up at a towering facade, with its strange wooden wedges, which made the building look like a model of a structure, except that it was occupied. The pudgy boy turned to me as I craned my neck. \u201cThis building is stupidly built,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s junk.\u201d", "\u201cDo you live here?\u201d I asked him, and he said yes.", "Shuafat Refugee Camp is inside Jerusalem proper, according to the municipal boundaries that Israel declared after the Six Day War in 1967. (Though the entire walled area is frequently referred to as the Shuafat Refugee Camp, the actual camp, run by the United Nation\u2019s relief agency for Palestinian refugees, is only a small portion. Adjacent to the camp are three neighborhoods that are the responsibility of the city of Jerusalem.) The Palestinian Authority has no jurisdiction there: The camp is, according to Israeli law, inside Israel, and the people who live there are Jerusalem residents, but they are refugees in their own city. Residents pay taxes to Israel, but the camp is barely serviced. There is very little legally supplied water, a scarcely functioning sewage system, essentially no garbage pickup, no road building, no mail service (the streets don\u2019t even have names, much less addresses), virtually no infrastructure of any kind. There is no adequate school system. Israeli emergency fire and medical services do not enter the camp. The Israeli police enter only to make arrests; they provide no security for camp residents. There is chaotic land registration. While no one knows how many people really live in the Shuafat camp and its three surrounding neighborhoods, which is roughly one square kilometer, it\u2019s estimated that the population is around 80,000. They live surrounded by a 25-foot concrete wall, a wall interspersed by guard towers and trapdoors that swing open when Israeli forces raid the camp, with reinforcements in the hundreds, or even, as in December 2015, over a thousand troops.", "Effectively, there are no laws in the Shuafat Refugee Camp, despite its geographical location inside Jerusalem. The Shuafat camp\u2019s original citizens were moved from the Old City, where they sought asylum in 1948 during the Arab-Israeli War, to the camp\u2019s boundaries starting in 1965, when the camp was under the control of the Jordanian government, with more arriving, in need of asylum, during and after the war in 1967. Now, 50 years after Israel\u2019s 1967 boundaries were drawn, even Israeli security experts don\u2019t quite know why the Shuafat Refugee Camp was placed inside the Jerusalem municipal boundaries. The population was much smaller then and surrounded by beautiful green, open forestland, which stretched to the land on which the Jewish settlement of Pisgat Ze\u2019ev was later built. (The forestland is still there, visible beyond the separation wall, but inaccessible to camp residents, on account of the wall.) Perhaps the Israelis were hoping the camp\u2019s residents could be relocated, because they numbered only a few thousand. Instead, the population of the camp exploded in the following decades into the tens of thousands. In 1980, Israel passed a law declaring Jerusalem the \u201ccomplete and united\u201d capital of Israel. In 2004, Israel began erecting the concrete wall around the camp, cutting inside Israel\u2019s own declared boundaries, as if to stanch and cauterize the camp from \u201cunited\u201d Jerusalem.", "If high-rise buildings are not typically conjured by the term \u201crefugee camp,\u201d neither is an indoor shopping mall, but there is one in the Shuafat camp: two floors and a third that was under construction, an escalator up and down and a store called Fendi, which sells inexpensive women\u2019s clothes. The mall owner greeted us with exuberance and pulled Baha aside to ask for advice of some kind. A teenager who worked at a mall ice-cream parlor, a hipster in a hoodie and eyeglass frames without lenses, did a world-class beatbox for me and Moriel Rothman-Zecher, a writer and organizer who had walked me into the camp in order to make introductions between me and Baha and to serve as my Arabic interpreter. Moriel and the teenager from the ice-cream shop took turns. Moriel\u2019s own beatbox was good but not quite up to the Shuafat Refugee Camp beatbox standard. We met an accountant named Fahed, who had just opened his shop in the mall to prepare taxes for residents. He was stunned to hear English being spoken and eager to use his own. The tax forms are in Hebrew, he explained, so most people in the camp must hire a bilingual accountant to complete them.", "Before the separation wall was constructed, the mall was bulldozed twice by the Israeli authorities, but the owner rebuilt both times. Since the wall has gone up, the Israelis have not tried to demolish any large buildings in Shuafat, though they have destroyed individual homes. Armed Palestinian gangsters could take away someone\u2019s land or apartment at any moment. A fire or earthquake would be catastrophic. There are multiple risks to buying property in the Shuafat camp, but the cost of an apartment there can be less than a tenth of what an apartment would cost on the other side of the separation wall, in East Jerusalem. And living in Shuafat is a way to try to hold onto Jerusalem residency status. Jerusalem residents have a coveted blue ID card, meaning they can enter Israel in order to work and support their families, unlike Palestinians with green, or West Bank ID cards, who need many supporting documents in order to enter Israel \u2014 to work or for any other reason, and who also must pass through military checkpoints like Qalandiya, which can require waiting in hourslong lines. Jerusalem residency is, quite simply, a lifeline to employment, a matter of survival.", "There are also non-Jerusalemites in the camp. Since the wall went up, it became a sanctuary, a haven. I met people from Gaza, who cannot leave the square kilometer of the camp or they risk arrest, because it is illegal for Gazans to enter Israel or the occupied West Bank except with Israeli permission, which is almost never granted. I met a family of Brazilian Palestinians with long-expired passports who also cannot leave the camp, because they do not have West Bank green IDs nor Jerusalem blue IDs.", "CreditLuca Locatelli/Institute, for The New York Times", "Shuafat camp is often depicted in the international media as the most dangerous place in Jerusalem, a crucible of crime, jihad and trash fires. On the day that I arrived, garbage was indeed smoldering in great heaps just inside the checkpoint entrance, against the concrete separation wall, flames jumping thinly in the strong morning sun. I had been to countries that burn their trash; it is a smell you get used to. My main concern, over the weekend I spent in the camp, was not getting my foot run over by a car. If you are seriously hurt in the camp, there isn\u2019t much help. Ill or injured people are carried through the checkpoint, on foot or by car, and put in ambulances on the other side of the wall. According to residents of the camp, several people have unnecessarily died in this manner.", "As we walked, I began to understand how to face the traffic without flinching, to expect that drivers are experienced at navigating such incredible human density. I asked Baha if people were ever run over by cars, assuming he would say no.", "\u201cYes, all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cA child was just killed this way,\u201d he added. I hugged the walls of the apartment buildings as we strolled. Later that evening, I watched as a tiny boy riding a grown man\u2019s bicycle was bumped by a car. He crashed in the road. I ran to help him. He was crying, holding out his abraded hands. I remembered how painful it is to scrape your palms, how many nerve endings there are in an open hand. A Palestinian man told the little boy he was O.K. and ruffled his hair.", "When I asked Baha if garbage was burned by the separation wall because it was safer \u2014 a way to contain a fire, like a giant fireplace \u2014 he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s, aah, symbolic.\u201d In other words, garbage is burned by the wall because the wall is Israeli. Drugs are sold along the wall by the Israeli checkpoint, not for symbolic reasons. The camp organizers, like Baha, cannot effectively control the drug trade in a zone patrolled by the Israeli police and monitored by security cameras. Dealers are safe there from the means of popular justice exacted inside the camp. The most heavily militarized area of the camp is perhaps its most lawless.", "The popular drug the dealers sell is called Mr. Nice Guy, which is sometimes categorized as a \u201csynthetic cannabinoid\u201d \u2014 a meaningless nomenclature. It is highly toxic, and its effects are nothing like cannabis. It can bring on psychosis. It damages brains and ruins lives. Baha told me that Mr. Nice Guy is popular with kids as young as 8. Empty packets of it sifted around at our feet as we crossed the large parking lot where buses pick up 6,000 children daily and transport them through the checkpoint for school, because the camp has only one public school, for elementary students. Every afternoon, children stream back into camp, passing the dealers and users who cluster near the checkpoint.", "I didn\u2019t see the dealers, but I doubt Baha would have pointed them out. What I mostly noticed were children working, being industrious, trying to find productive ways to live in a miserable environment and to survive. Across from Baha\u2019s house, a group of kids run a carwash. We waved to them from Baha\u2019s roof. Baha introduced me to a group of teenage boys who own their own moped-and-scooter-repair service. He took me to a barber shop, where kids in flawless outfits with high-side fades were hanging out, listening to music, while a boy of about 13 gave a haircut to a boy of about 5. A young teenager in a pristine white polo shirt and delicate gold neck chain flexed his baby potato of a biceps and announced his family name: \u201cAlqam!\u201d", "The children in the barbershop were all Alqam. They ran the shop. They were ecstatic to see Baha. We were all ecstatic. The language barrier between me and the boys only thickened our collective joy, as my interpreter Moriel was whisked into a barber chair for a playfully coerced beard trim, on the house. The boys and I shouldered up for selfies, put on our sunglasses and posed. Whenever men shook my hand after Baha introduced me, I sensed \u2014 especially after Moriel left that afternoon \u2014 that men and boys would not get so physically close to a Palestinian woman who was a stranger. But I was an American woman, and I was with Baha, which made me something like an honorary man.", "Later I told myself and everyone else how wonderful it was in the Shuafat camp. How safe I felt. How positive Baha was. All of that still feels true to me. But I also insisted, to myself and everyone else, that Baha never expressed any fears for his own safety. In looking at my notes, I see now that my insistence on this point was sheer will. A fiction. It\u2019s right there in the notes. He said he was nervous. He said he\u2019d been threatened.", "Also in my notes, this:", "Baha says, two types", "1. Those who want to help make a better life", "2. Those who want to destroy everything", "And in parentheses: (Arms trade. Drugs trade. Construction profits. No oversight wanted.)", "\u201cI wanted you to meet the boys because they are nice people,\u201d Baha said, after we left the barbershop. \u201cBut they do all carry guns.\u201d It was only after I returned home to the United States that I learned, in the banal and cowardly way, with a few taps on my computer, that two Alqam boys, cousins who were 12 and 14, had been accused of stabbing, with a knife and scissors, an Israeli security guard on a tram in East Jerusalem. I still don\u2019t know whether they were related to the boys in the barber shop. Several of the young assailants in what has been called the Knives Intifada have been from the Shuafat camp, which has also been the site of huge and violent protests in which Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces. In 2015, three children from the Shuafat Refugee Camp lost eyes from sponge bullets shot by Israeli forces.", "The other thing I suppressed, besides Baha\u2019s admissions of fear, was his desire for police. I didn\u2019t write that down. It wasn\u2019t part of my hero narrative, because the police are not part of my hero narrative. \u201cEven if they have to bring them from India,\u201d he said several times, \u201cwe need police here. We cannot handle the disputes on our own. People take revenge. They murder.\u201d", "A Middle East correspondent I met in the West Bank, hearing that I was going to spend the weekend in the Shuafat camp, asked me if I \u201cplanned to visit Shit Lake\u201d while there. Apparently that was his single image of the place. I assumed he was referring to a sewage dump, but Baha never mentioned it, and after seeing Baha\u2019s pleasure in showing me the community center, the roads his committee had built, the mall, which was the only open gathering space, all things that, for him, were hopeful, I wasn\u2019t going to ask him for Shit Lake.", "That correspondent had never stepped foot in the camp. I hadn\u2019t expected to either, until I was invited on an extensive tour of the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and was asked to choose a subject to write about, for a book to be published next year. With no previous experience in the region, and little knowledge, I gravitated instinctually to Shuafat camp. From my own time there, the sustaining image is shimmering white. The kids, dressed in white. The buildings, a baked tone of dusty, smoke-stained white. The minarets, all white. And there was the 1972 Volkswagen Beetle in gleaming white, meticulously restored. It was on the shop floor of a garage run by Baha\u2019s friend Adel. A classic-car enthusiast and owner myself, I wanted to talk to Adel about the car. He showed me his garage, his compressor, his lift. Like the escalator in the mall, these were things you would never expect to find in a place without services.", "We sat, and Adel made coffee. He and Baha told me about the troubles with the drug Mr. Nice Guy. They said every family has an addict among its children and sometimes among the older people as well. A third of the population is strung out on it, they said. It makes people crazy, Adel and Baha agreed. Is there a link, I asked, between Mr. Nice Guy and the kids who decide, essentially, to end it all by running at an Israeli soldier with a knife? They each concurred that there was. Two years earlier, Baha said, by way of contrast, there was a man from the Shuafat camp who did a deadly car ramming. The Israelis came and blew up his house. He was older, Baha said, and out of work and he decided that he was finally ready to lose everything. With the kids, Baha said, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s an act of impulsive courage. The drug helps enormously with that.", "Adel kept making reference to his 9-year-old daughter, who is physically disabled and cannot attend school. I asked to meet her or Adel asked if I wanted to meet her. Either way we ended up in Adel\u2019s large apartment, and his daughter Mira was wheeled out to the living room. Mira was burned over most of her body and is missing part of one arm and a kneecap. Her face and scalp are disfigured. A school bus filled with children from the Shuafat camp were on a trip to Ramallah when their bus collided with a truck on wet roads. The bus overturned and burst into flames. Five children and a teacher burned to death. Dozens were injured. Emergency services were delayed by confusion over who had jurisdiction. As a result, Mira and other children had to be taken in the cars of bystanders to the closest hospital. The accident took place between the Adam settlement and Qalandiya checkpoints, in what is called Area C of the West Bank, which is entirely under Israeli control. The likelihood of something like this occurring was well known. Later, a report from Ir Amim, an Israeli human rights group, established that the tragedy resulted from the multiple challenges of living beyond the separation barrier. Roads were substandard. There were too many children on the bus, the children had no access to education in their own communities and there was no oversight.", "\u201cWhen the accident happened, we didn\u2019t know how to cope with it,\u201d Baha told me. Someone got up on a loading dock in the camp and called out the names of the dead. Afterward, Baha and Adel cried all the time. They felt that the lives of Shuafat\u2019s children were disposable. They decided to start their own volunteer emergency team, through WhatsApp, and it has 80 members, who are trained in first aid and in special skills they are ready to employ at a moment\u2019s notice. They are saving up to purchase their own Shuafat camp ambulance, whose volunteer drivers will be trained medical professionals, like Baha\u2019s wife, Hiba, who is a nurse.", "Baha, I noticed, seemed more optimistic about their emergency team, and about the future, than Adel did. At one point, Adel, who has a shattered and frantic but loving, warm energy, turned to me and said, \u201cWe are orphans here.\u201d", "Mira, who had been transferred from her wheelchair to the couch, sat and fidgeted. She understood no English but was forced to quietly pretend she was listening. I kept smiling at her, and she smiled back. I was desperate to give her something, to promise something. It\u2019s very difficult to see a child who has suffered so tremendously. It\u2019s basically unbearable. I should give her the ring I was wearing, I thought. But then I saw that it would never fit her fingers, which were very swollen and large, despite her young age; her development, after the fire, was thwarted because her bones could not properly grow. I\u2019ll give her my earrings, was my next idea, and then I realized that her ears had been burned off in the fire. I felt obscene. I sat and smiled as if my oversize teeth could beam a protective fiction over this poor child, blind us both to the truth, that no shallow gesture or petty generosity would make any lasting difference, and that her life was going to be difficult.", "The travel agency in the Shuafat mall is called Hope. There is a toy store in the mall called the Happy Child. The children I met were all Baha\u2019s kids, part of his group, on his team, drafting off his energy, which was relentlessly upbeat.", "I have to recreate, with all the precision I can manage, to remember what I am able to about Baha. I see Baha in his pink polo shirt, tall and handsome, but with a soft belly that somehow reinforces his integrity, makes him imperfectly, perfectly human. Baha singing \u201cBella Ciao\u201d in well-keyed Italian, a language he learned at 19, on the trip that changed his life, working with Vento di Terra, a community-development and human rights group based in Italy. Later, I sent a video of Baha singing to various Italian friends, leftists who were thrilled that a guy in a Palestinian refugee camp knew the words to \u201cBella Ciao.\u201d", "Baha\u2019s friends and relatives all hugging me and cheek-kissing me, the women bringing out boxes that contained their hand-embroidered wedding dresses, insisting I try on each dress, whose colors and designs specified where they were from: one in black with white stitching, from Ramallah. Cream with red, Jerusalem. In each case we took a photo, laughing, me in each dress, with the woman it belonged to on my arm.", "Everyone imploring me to come back, and to bring Remy, my 8-year-old, and I was sure that I would come back, and bring Remy, because I had fallen in love with these people.", "And in the background of the hugs and kisses, in almost every home where we spent time, the TV playing the Islamic channel, Palestine Al-Yawm, a relentless montage of blood, smoke, fire and kaffiyeh-wrapped fighters with M-16s.", "The constant hospitality. Coffee, tea, mint lemonade, ice water, all the drinks I politely accepted. Drank and then sloshed along, past faded wheat-pasted posters of jihadist martyrs.", "Come back. Bring Remy. I will, I told them, and I meant it.", "Late at night, Baha and Hiba decided to show me their digital wedding photo book. It was midnight, their two young daughters asleep on couches around us. Hiba propped an iPad on a table \u2014 she was four months pregnant, expecting her third child, a boy \u2014 and we looked at every last image, hundreds of images, of her and Baha in highly curated poses and stiff wedding clothes, her fake-pearl-and-rhinestone tiara, her beautiful face neutralized by heavy makeup; but the makeup is part of the ritual, and the ritual is part of the glory. The two of them in a lush park in West Jerusalem. Every picture we looked at was, for them watching me see the images, a new delight: There were more and more and more. For me, they all started to run together, it was now 1 in the morning, I was exhausted, but I made myself regard each photograph as something unique, a vital integer in the stream of these people\u2019s refusal to be reduced.", "I slept in what they called their Arabic room, on low cushions, a barred window above me issuing a cool breeze. I listened to roosters crow and the semiautomatic weapons being fired at a nearby wedding celebration, and eventually I drifted into the calmest, heaviest sleep I\u2019d had in months.", "The next day, Baha had meetings to attend to try to solve the water problem. I spoke to Hiba about their kids. She asked me at what age Remy started his piano lessons. \u201cI want music lessons for the girls,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very good for their development.\u201d As she said it, more machine-gun fire erupted from the roof of a nearby building. \u201cI want them to know the feel, the smells, of a different environment. To be able to imagine other lives.\u201d", "When I think of Hiba Nababta wanting what I want for my child, her rightful desire that her kids should have an equal chance, everything feels hopeless and more obscene, even, than my wanting to give earrings to a child without ears.", "I went with Hiba that morning to her mother\u2019s house, where she and Hiba\u2019s sisters were preparing an exquisite meal of stuffed grape leaves and stuffed squashes, the grape leaves and vegetables grown on her mother\u2019s patio. We were all women, eating together in relaxed company. A sister-in-law came downstairs to join us, sleepy, beautiful, with long red nails and hair dyed honey blond, in her pajamas and slippers. She said that she was leaving for New Jersey with her husband, Hiba\u2019s brother, and their new baby. Relatives had arranged for them to immigrate. She would learn English and go to school.", "When it was time to say goodbye, a younger sister was appointed to walk me to the checkpoint. Halfway there, I assured her I could walk alone, and we said goodbye. On the main road, shopkeepers came out to wave and smile. Everyone seemed to know who I was: the American who had come to meet with Baha.", "At the checkpoint, the Palestinian boy in front of me was detained. I was next, and the soldiers were shocked to see an American, as they would have been shocked to see any non-Palestinian. There was much consternation in the reinforced station. My passport went from hand to hand. The commander approached the scratched window. \u201cYou\u2019re a Jew, right?\u201d he blurted into the microphone. For the context in which he asked, for its reasoning, I said no. But in fact, I\u2019m ethnically half-Jewish, on my father\u2019s side, although I was not raised with any religious or even a cultural connection to Judaism. My mother is a white Protestant from Tennessee. I might have said, \u201cYes, partly,\u201d but I found the question unanswerable, on account of its conflation of Zionism and Jewish identity. My Yiddish-speaking Odessan great-grandfather was a clothing merchant on Orchard Street. My grandfather worked in his shop as a boy. That is classically Jewish, but my sense of self, of what it might mean to inherit some trace of that lineage, was not the kind of patrimony the soldier was asking after. I was eventually waved along.", "The day I left Shuafat camp was April 17. Fifteen days later, on May 2, Baha Nababta was murdered in the camp. An unknown person approached on a motorcycle as Baha worked with roughly a hundred fellow camp residents to pave a road. In front of this very large crowd of people, working together, the person on the motorcycle shot at Baha 10 times and fled. Seven bullets hit him.", "It is now December. Baha\u2019s wife, Hiba, has given birth to their son. His father is gone. His mother is widowed. But a baby \u2014 a baby can thrive no matter.

There is no substitute for water. As the world's population continues to grow and becomes wealthier, demand for water is rising fast. According to the UN, by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under water stress. From human consumption to industrial and agricultural use, global demand for water and water services are expected to outpace current supply. The International Food Policy Research Institute suggests that there will be a 40% gap between water demand and supply over the next 15 years. Agriculture is the largest user of water (70%), followed by industry (20%) and individuals (10%). Every person drinks 2-4 liters of water a day and eats 2,000-5,000 liters of virtual water in the food they consume.", "There are opportunities to invest in water scarcity in both emerging markets and the U.S. In China, 80% of rivers are too toxic for fish, let along human consumption.

This season Mercedes won its third straight championship, and in those three seasons only four teams have finished among the top three. Sponsorship investment in the sport is largely stagnant and few new corporate partners have entered the sport. And global interest continues to dry up - TV viewership is down to some 400 million, or a roughly 33% drop over the last eight years.", "And yet this season the on-track action was meaningful right down to the wire, with Nico Rosberg clinching his first drivers' championship in the season's very last race (last year Lewis Hamilton locked up a second consecutive title with three races left). Haas F1, the first team from the United States to compete in Formula One since the 1980s, excelled in its premier season, finishing eighth with 29 points. And taking the biggest headline of all was Formula One itself: The series was finally sold after years of rumors, with billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media taking over in a deal that valued the series at $8 billion.", "We ultimately estimate that franchise values are mostly flat for the time being. Though Liberty's investment may wind up boosting the sport and its teams in the long run, especially if Liberty makes efforts to target some of the struggles we highlighted in our story a year ago, the average team is now worth $446 million, up just one-third of a percent from last year. Our values are based on team financial performances in the 2015 season, so this year's valuations do not yet include Haas.", "Ferrari remains on top, now worth $1.33 billion. No team comes close to matching the Italian powerhouse, though the next three are in a close race for second place: Mercedes ($685 million) , McLaren ($655 million) and Red Bull ($630 million). We expect Mercedes will continue to close the gap, especially as its ongoing dominance of the sport will guarantee greater future revenues from series prize money.", "Most in the industry appear to be in agreement that Liberty's takeover will benefit the sport. Liberty has already talked about its intentions to improve digital operations and global promotion, and a new set of eyes may take a more critical look at the sport's vast financial inequalities among teams. Investors have apparently liked what they've seen so far, as Liberty's stock is up more than 40% since announcing its acquisition in September. Yet how the media company's investment and leadership winds up impacting the teams and their valuations largely remains to be seen; for the time being, the sport's finances are steady.", "Sponsorship money, the very lifeblood of the sport and what allows teams to collectively shell out some $2 billion per season, has increased slightly for some teams but few new corporate partners are entering the sport. And it seems car-side advertising is continually dominated by the same major sponsors, or lack thereof - McLaren continues to race without a title sponsor since losing Vodafone's $75 million-per-year investment three years ago, which may help explain why longtime team chairman Ron Dennis was pushed out of his role in November.", "Series-level revenues have also remained mostly flat. Formula One's commercial rights income increased by $20 million in 2015, but revenues from advertising and sponsorships fell by $14 million. Thankfully for the teams, their share of series revenue rose by $41 million (or 5%) to $904 million, which was paid out in quarterly installments this year as prize money. Of course those payouts help some teams far more than others, since the grid's top teams are ensured greater guarantees as part of their agreements to stay in the series until 2020. That partly explains the stark drop off in value from F1's elites to the lower-tier teams, which typically share the scraps of what Formula One distributes (last year's bottom three teams collectively received just 18% of the pot).", "And as always, Formula One remains the sports world's best way to quickly lose lots of money. That's because profitability is rarely an end goal. Instead, most teams consider breaking even as a best-case scenario, while the often-significant losses are viewed as marketing expenses for parent companies that desire exposure in F1's global market. FORBES estimates that just four teams made money last year, and two of those were Red Bull and Toro Rosso, which count a significant portion of parent company Red Bull GmbH's investment as sponsorship revenue rather than team expense. Total net losses for the ten teams in last season's grid: $134 million.", "Some of the sport's top teams are taking the biggest hits on the bottom line. Mercedes has dominated on the track, but it's cost a fortune to do so. Last season the team lost $50 million despite increasing revenues 45% to $315 million. The German outfit will see its cut of prize money increase thanks to its on-track success (the full financial impact of winning takes some time to kick in), but Mercedes has shown no signs that it plans to cut back on spending - last year the team shelled out $115 million just on staff costs, or 67% more than McLaren.", "And even Ferrari, the premier team that's as old as the sport itself, has hit some snags. Last year the Italian team picked up nearly $20 million in new sponsorship and commercial revenues, but research and development costs tied to engine development skyrocketed while it lost $12 million in engine rental income (the latter is not a major concern, as Toro Rosso and Haas both used Ferrari motors in 2016). Ferrari was still in the black, but its $7 million in operating income was just a 1.5% margin.", "For now the view is rightly on the longterm, especially as teams consider investing in the series. Liberty made public that it was opening the door for teams to take a financial stake in F1, and several teams have reportedly expressed interest (as of now the only team ownership is Ferrari's single share, or 24 billionths of a percent, of parent company Delta Topco). Not only could that series equity increase in value, but the teams would also presumably get a greater say in rules changes, which often have major impacts on team spending - some teams are still feeling the effects of the 2014 move from V8 engines to V6 turbo power units.", "Follow @ChrisSmith813"], "targetTitle": "Formula One's Most Valuable Teams", "postTimestamp": "Fri Dec 02 20:41:02 +0000 2016", "targetKeywords": "", "targetDescription": "The sale of F1 to John Malone's Liberty Media made headlines the world over, but how the new investment and change in leadership will impact the sport's financial fortunes remains to be seen."}

She couldn\u2019t appear in the video, but kept in touch with Cruz, co-founder of Face Time. The following year, they met again at the RichGang video shoot in New Jersey. \u201cWe just clicked,\u201d Blue says of Cruz.", "Blue was the youngest of the models on set that day, and kept to herself most of the time. Just like at her Yeezy debut, she was \u201cnervous as hell. I was in a mansion full of girls I\u2019d never seen before, who were much older, much more experienced than I was, and had a different look than me. Compared to them, I looked like a little girl. I was like, \u2018What am I doing here?\u2019\u201d", "Looking back, she doesn\u2019t consider such video work to be \u201creal\u201d modeling. \u201cWe can call it what it is: It\u2019s sitting in front of a camera and shaking your butt,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not me, but we all have to start somewhere. Nobody wants to be a video vixen all their life.\u201d", "In February 2015, Blue got her big break: She was booked as a model for West\u2019s Yeezy Season 1 runway show, which featured a physically and ethnically diverse cast. She wasn\u2019t initially going to go to the casting call because she had just had surgery on her foot, but Cruz convinced her otherwise. \u201cI had to yell at her to go to the casting,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was like, \u2018You better get your crutches and get up in this casting!\u2019\u201d Blue went, with a wrap on her foot. The casting turned into a fitting, and she \u201cnever left,\u201d Cruz recalls.", "\u201cThey plucked her from the casting line, and she stood there for eight hours, working. Most of the girls had to get called back. But for her, they immediately were like, \u2018You\u2019re with us now.\u2019\u201d From what Cruz can remember, West and his team told him that they replaced one of the models with Blue because \u201cthat [other] girl had no swag.\u201d", "\u201c[Kanye] gave me the opportunity, and his fanbase accepted me,\u201d Blue adds. \u201cHe\u2019s accepting of everything I want to do,\u201d she says, clarifying that the rapper wasn\u2019t upset when she took off her shoes as she walked the runway during the Yeezy Season 4 show. \u201cI was either going to fall or look like a dummy, so I took them off,\u201d she says, flatly. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna make a fool out of myself. I talked to him about it after and he was like, \u2018I don\u2019t care. Do what you gotta do.\u2019\u201d", "She calls West a \u201cfriend,\u201d and says they\u2019ve developed a close relationship. When asked about \u00a0West\u2019s recent hospitalization, she\u2019s sympathetic towards the rapper. \u201cKanye is always under a microscope but people tend to forget he\u2019s human, like the rest of us,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all go through things and need all the support we can get to get through hard times. He\u2019s no different.\u201d", "Blue is quick to credit West for her modeling career. \u201cIt was all him,\u201d she says. But she admits that even with a high-profile co-sign like that, some in the fashion industry still aren\u2019t accepting of her curvy, tattooed frame. \u201cPeople give me a funny look like, \u2018What is this girl doing here?\u2019 Even some of the people Kanye works with look at me and say, \u2018Are you really gonna make me work with this girl?\u2019\u201d", "\"Kanye is always under a microscope but people tend to forget he\u2019s human, like the rest of us.\"", "One person who has welcomed Blue is Roitfeld, the revered fashion editor who has helped shape the careers of plenty of models, including Gigi and Bella Hadid and the similarly voluptuous Kate Upton. In the fall of 2015, Roitfeld reached out to Blue about featuring her in an issue of CR Fashion Book. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know who she was at first,\u201d Blue admits. \u201cI got an email from her assistant, and I forwarded it to Kanye. He was like, \u2018Yeah, do it!\u2019 He was so psyched. I did my research on her and realized she\u2019s Carine Roitfeld.\u201d Now, she calls Roitfeld, like Kanye, a \u201creally good friend.\u201d", "\u201cI met Amina with Kanye. He introduced me to her,\u201d Roitfeld told New York Magazine\u2019s The Cut. \u201cShe is very lovely and interesting.\u201d", "Even with high-profile supporters in her corner\u2014or perhaps because of them\u2014Blue has found herself the subject of the uglier side of Internet fame. This past summer, there were rumors that Tyga was cheating on Kylie Jenner with Blue. \u201cI had people writing me hate mail like, \u2018I want to cut your throat,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018What did I do to you? Leave me the fuck alone!\u2019 It was so stupid because Kylie was in the mansion with us [on the set of Tyga\u2019s \u201c1 of 1\u201d video shoot].\u201d", "But for the most part, Blue doesn\u2019t seem easily dispelled. When asked about the criticisms of her body, her answer is forthright: \u201cThese people don\u2019t think I should be here. But that can\u2019t be my mentality too. If I was insecure or unsure of where my place was, I probably wouldn\u2019t have made it this far.\u201d", "Blue explains her tenacity as the result of her upbringing: She was raised by a single mother who worked three jobs, and lost her brother in a motorcycle accident when she was in her early teens. \u201cMost girls who have dads growing up have an easier life,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, my brother was that dad figure to me. When he passed away, I didn\u2019t have that anymore. I had to grow up quicker.\u201d", "Right now, growing and expanding the Amina Blue brand is her focus. At Kavasutra, Blue and Cruz are joined by a friend who\u2019s helping write the script for a film Blue is set to appear in. \u201cIt\u2019s still new for me, but I like it,\u201d she says of acting. She\u2019s taking drama classes at Actors Connection in Manhattan, and has signed on to be a part of a VH1 reality show about working models, executive-produced by LaLa Anthony and featuring music by Timbaland. \u201cIt won\u2019t be anything ratchet like Love & Hip-Hop,\u201d she promises. She\u2019s also finalizing her vegan shoe line and would like to partner with an anti-poaching organization. \u201cI\u2019m proud of where I am, but I feel like I have more to do,\u201d she says. Just as she starts thinking about her future, she cracks that big, beautiful\u2014and very rare\u2014smile. \u201cI want to be able to wake up in the morning and do whatever I want.\u201d", "\u00a0", "Want more Amina Blue?

Usually, they first take a shower, check their phones and maybe catch up with some family members meandering about the locker room entrance.", "Not so on Monday night for Draymond Green, who only slipped a pair of shower shoes over his socks. Still clad in his sweat-soaked jersey, which sported a speck of someone's blood above the Warriors logo, Green met the media looking like he could still play an overtime or two.", "But his defense against the Atlanta Hawks had rendered that scenario unnecessary. With two spectacular stops in the final minute, Green saved yet another a win, 105-100, for the Warriors, who are now a league-best 16-2 and riding a 12-game win streak into Thursday's showdown with James Harden and the high-scoring Houston Rockets.", "For weeks now, Golden State head coach Steve Kerr has been trumpeting Green's defensive bona fides at every available opportunity, not so subtly campaigning on his behalf for the Defensive Player of the Year Award. (Green has placed second for that bit of hardware two years running, finishing runner-up both times to Kawhi Leonard of the San Antonio Spurs.)", "\"That was amazing,\" Kerr said Monday of Green's end-of-game heroics. \"I don't know if I've seen a sequence like that from one guy.\u00a0The whole team was defending well, and we covered up shooters and switched well, but those two plays ended up with one-on-one plays against Draymond, and he blocks both shots off the other guys.", "\"Just an incredible defensive sequence. Draymond is amazing. He literally can guard anybody in the league from Dwight Howard to [Dennis] Schroder and everybody else in between.\"", "Green himself has made no secret that he feels he's the NBA's best defensive player. If anything, his much-publicized suspension for Game 5 of last June's NBA Finals may have only further secured that belief in the minds of so many.", "The Warriors, then and now, are simply a different defensive team without Green on the floor, scattered and less confident. It's the difference between treading water in the pool versus gunning for an Olympic-record time.", "But Kevin Durant's celebrated arrival meant losing Andrew Bogut, Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezeli\u2014three excellent defenders who could either protect the rim (Ezeli), defend larger players in the post (Barnes) or both (Bogut).", "The idea that Golden State would now have to concentrate on outscoring its opponents rather than reinvent a defense that was No. 1 in efficiency just two seasons ago didn't sit well with the All-Star and Olympic gold medalist.", "\"I wouldn't necessarily say I have something to prove for [DPOY], more so because people have counted our defense out with Bogut leaving, and that kind of pisses me off,\" Green said after the win over Atlanta. \"I've never been the guy to pride myself on [awards], but it'd be cool to win, absolutely. My goal coming into this season is to win a championship, and in order for us to win a championship, we have to defend.", "\"The world says we traded our defense away when we got [Durant]. I disagree. I think our defense actually has the upside to be better with our length that we have, the speed, the athleticism. So that pissed me off more than anything...I take that personally, so that pushes me more than anything else.\"", "There's a little hyperbole baked into Green's thinking, but he's not far off. The Warriors are more reliant on length and positioning now, and the physicality that left with Bogut won't be replaced by his successor, Zaza Pachulia, or anyone else on this roster.", "But Golden State's defense is getting the job done. Assistant coach Ron Adams has this team sitting eighth in defensive rating, allowing 101.5 points per 100 possessions. The Warriors are\u00a0first in blocks per game and second in steals. Their defensive rebounding rate is still lousy\u2014only the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks are worse\u2014but Kerr can live with that for now.", "Another factor pulling down the Warriors' metrics is the team's poor play in late-game garbage time, when the outcome is essentially decided and starters for both teams are bolted to the bench. To wit, Golden State has the third-best defensive rating in the first half of all games, while its fourth-quarter defensive rating falls all the way to No. 21.", "Which brings us back to Green. When the Warriors have played tight fourth quarters with decisive moments, Green has played like a star.", "Back on Oct. 30 against the Phoenix Suns, Devin Booker got separation from Stephen Curry so Green left his man, Tyson Chandler, to help defend the rim. Instead of allowing Booker to bank in a floater, Green blocked his shot and tried to slam the ball off him and out of bounds. Chandler dived to save the ball, only to have it roll toward Klay Thompson.", "Then, with the Suns only down five, Green not only blocked Eric Bledsoe's layup attempt without committing a foul, but he forced a jump ball, which he then won with ease. Golden State also won, 106-100.", "Two weeks later on Nov. 13, Green switched onto Booker, forcing the second-year Suns star to pass inside to rookie Marquese Chriss, who opted for a tough 13-foot turnaround over Thompson. After then going the other way, Green saved a pass from going over the midcourt line and ran a pick-and-roll with Curry for an easy slam to seal the eventual 133-120 victory.", "On Nov. 19, with the Milwaukee Bucks down two late, Tony Snell was not exactly hiding the fact he wanted his inbounds pass to reach Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was posted up on Green. Not only did Green push Antetokounmpo\u00a0out a couple of feet by the time the pass was lobbed, but he also got enough positioning to lean in over the top (without fouling) and deflect the ball to Thompson, thus securing a 124-121 win.", "This was one of Green's less-heralded plays on Monday night against the Hawks. It didn't happen in the fourth, but it was no less important. Green did enough to distract Kent Bazemore in transition that he blew the layup and then committed a needless foul by slapping the ball out of Pachulia's hands.", "How frustrated was Bazemore? After that sequence, the Hawks' $70 million combo guard\u00a0had more fouls committed (three) than points scored (two) for the rest of the game.", "Atlanta still had chances to win late, only down four with under a minute to play, but Green stalked Schroder on this possession like a predator through the high grass. He allowed just enough separation so that the refs wouldn't feel obliged to call a foul, even while using his left arm for leverage. The result was a double-block\u00a0wherein the ball bounced off Schroder's head and out of bounds to give a critical possession back to Golden State.", "With the score still 104-100, Bazemore split through Curry and Durant on the perimeter, only to meet up with a waiting Green, who blocked him and forced the ball out of bounds off his feet. The Hawks never scored again.", "A lot of what Green does in these clips is not even directly reflected in the box score, at least not in his realm of the stat sheet. Sure, he gets a block or steal here and there. But his numbers against Atlanta? Four points, three rebounds and seven assists in 39 minutes.\u00a0", "Point is, there are so many dimensions to how Green can disrupt an opposing offense, and you have to watch to see them all. He's a player who, in all ways, demands your undivided attention\u2014a deflection here, a jump ball there, a forced turnover late in the game. His defense alone was instrumental in at least the four wins outlined above. Not even 20 games into the season, that\u00a0could have mammoth implications come playoff time.", "\"At the end of the day, you've always got to get stops to close the game out, and when you can be in the middle of all of it and try to create some conflict for the other team, it's a pretty good feeling,\" Green said after beating Atlanta.", "If he keeps up this intensity, neither Green nor his coach will have to lobby hard for that elusive Defensive Player of the Year Award come June 26.", "\u00a0 \u00a0", "The Warriors captured their 12th straight victory with the win over Atlanta\u00a0and continued one of the longest win streaks in franchise history.", "The current march matches the dozen they won during the spring of 2015. The only streaks to top these are the 16 in a row recorded across November and December of 2014 and, of course, the 28 straight built on the back of last season's 24-0 start.", "In other words, the four longest winning streaks\u00a0for the Warriors\u2014who have been around for 70 years and are one of the NBA's charter franchises\u2014have all occurred since Kerr became head coach.", "The Warriors are also the ninth team in NBA history to have a double-digit win streak during four consecutive seasons. Only the Seattle SuperSonics (five, 1992-97), Boston Celtics (five, 1970-75) and San Antonio Spurs (six, 2010-16) have posted longer multiyear streaks.\u00a0", "\u00a0 \u00a0", "\"Who cares who shoots?\"", "That was Durant's semi-rhetorical response on Monday night when asked how the offense seems so seamlessly spread out.\u00a0", "And so far, so good for Kerr's star players.\u00a0With Curry, Durant and Thompson all averaging above 20 points per game, the Warriors would be the first NBA team to have a trio of 20-point scorers since, well, the Warriors of 2007-08, when Monta Ellis, Baron Davis and Stephen Jackson all joined the club.", "\u00a0 \u00a0", "Golden State may have snapped its franchise-record 10-game streak of 30 assists or more, but they still have a run of games with 25-plus assists still active.\u00a0", "After only chipping in 24 dimes on opening night against the Spurs, the Warriors have hit at least 25 during every game since.", "That 17-game streak is now second all-time in Warriors' history\u00a0and\u00a0just three away from the top mark set across the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons.", "\u00a0 \u00a0", "Erik Malinowski is the Golden State Warriors lead writer for B/R.
