Cavaliers Fan Traveled to Memphis on Night LeBron James Rested
Cavaliers Fan Traveled to Memphis on Night LeBron James Rested
The pain is real pic.twitter.com/xL97ifoSjS A devoted fan voyaged to Memphis to watch Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James play the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night. Unfortunately for him and everyone else in attendance, James wasn't even within a 700-mile radius. James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love all stayed home, prompting James Jones to lead the Cavs with 15 points in a 93-85 loss. Cleveland has every right to keep its stars fresh during an 82-game prelude to the playoffs, but it certainly leaves customers like the one above disappointed. The fan ended up spending $800 to see the big three of Jones, Jordan McRae and Kay Felder. Top contenders will continue to strategically rest key players during the season. Going forward, any fans considering an expensive voyage should prepare accordingly and check the schedule to avoid the second game of a back-to-back tilt. [ 3 Shades of Blue ]
