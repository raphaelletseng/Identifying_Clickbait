Tony Richardson Misspells 'Jets' During Draft Announcement
The New York J-E-T-E â€” JETS...wait, what? https://t.co/CEYX89AJ6D https://t.co/RNxsptszkh Well...that's one way to spell it. Former New York Jets fullback Tony Richardson helped announce the team's 2017 draft picks Friday night, and he apparently got so caught up in the moment that he lost his handle on the alphabet. While introducing the 79th pick of the draft, Richardson flubbed the spelling of his former team, spelling it J-E-T-E. The flub seemed to fly right past him. But of course, the internet misses nothing.
