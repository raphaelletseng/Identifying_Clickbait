Conservative provocateur James O'Keefe says he plans to leak 'hundreds of hours of tape' in CNN exposÃ©


Conservative provocateurÂ James O'Keefe said Tuesday that heÂ plans to release "hundreds of hours of tape" he said would expose CNN.

Speaking withÂ Fox News host Sean Hannity in a radio interview on Tuesday, O'Keefe said he had accrued the unaired footage inside CNN's newsrooms from employees, according to reports fromÂ the network itselfÂ and The Huffington Post.

He also alluded to releasingÂ the obtained footage "WikiLeaks-style," or in systematic batches.Â Some of theÂ footage isÂ scheduled to be released on Thursday afternoon, O'Keefe said. He said it centers onÂ "one corporation, multiple newsrooms."

O'Keefe's planned exposÃ© follows a tenuous month during which President DonaldÂ Trump, his staff, and alliesÂ have devoted much airtime in criticizing and labelingÂ CNN asÂ "fake news."Â

"My audience, the American people, are deeply upset at the media," O'Keefe told CNN in a telephone interview. "We think our media needs to be held to account, and CNN is kind of the leader of that. CNN has a very important role as an arbiter of news."

"This is all legally recorded information," he said.

The purportedÂ leaks also comeÂ after O'Keefe's statements from last month's pre-inauguration party dubbed the "DeploraBall."Â At the event, he said he planned onÂ "going after the media next" and even called his footage "CNN Leaks."

"We are inside their newsrooms," he said, according toÂ Politico. He added he had spies "embedded in your institutions."

O'Keefe has built a reputation of using questionable methods to secure recordings and has been accused of selective-editing practices during his video investigations. He first gained notoriety in 2009, after releasing undercover videos that alleged illegal activity by employeesÂ of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), a nonprofit organization that advocated for issues like voter registration.

One employee sued O'Keefe, alleging he broke the law by taping without consent. O'KeefeÂ ended up settling the case forÂ $100,000. TheÂ videos led to theÂ federal defunding of the group.Â ACORN later filed for bankruptcy.
