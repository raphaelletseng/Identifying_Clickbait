Eleven Madison Park in New York triumphed Wednesday in the World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards, becoming the first U.S. establishment to win the top spot since 2004. Chef Daniel Humm’s contemporary American restaurant toppled Italy’s Osteria Francescana, which came in second after winning the title for the first time last year. Spanish restaurant El Celler de Can Roca came in third. The winners were announced in a ceremony at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne. The  list is decided by a panel of more than 1,000 chefs, food writers and other experts from 26 geographical regions.

The latest menu costs $295 plus tax for eleven courses. The awards started in 2002, the product of a brainstorming session in a pub about how to promote U.K.-based Restaurant magazine.
