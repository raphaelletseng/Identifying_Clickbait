Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump's Florida resort and club, has quickly become known as the "Winter White House."Â Trump himself has also referred to it as his "Southern White House," as he has already spent several consecutive weekends there during his time in office.

Mar-a-Lago became the subject of anÂ ethical debate after the president was photographed being briefed on North Korea's missile test while hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the resort in February. Democrats in Congress have called for Trump to release lists of the dignitaries he plans to host at the Palm Beach resort, as well as a complete list of paying members, in order to resolve potential conflicts of interest. The club has not yet done so.

According to The New York Times, the number of applications to join the club soared in the wake of Trump's election as president.Â The club recently doubled its initial membership fee to $200,000, and members must also pay $14,000 in annual fees. Mar-a-Lago has nearly 500 members, and there are still some memberships available. Those who do join are welcome to enjoy the 20-acre club's beach, pool, spa, and dining options along with many of those in Trump's inner circle.Â

The Times and Politico recently published incomplete lists of Mar-a-Lago's members, many of whom are Wall Streeters, real estate moguls, energy executives, and Trump campaign donors. We've rounded up 15 of the most notable names among them.Â
