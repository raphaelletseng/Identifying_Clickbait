U.S. President Donald Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Feb. 22, 2017 in Washington, DC.

All eyes were on Donald Trump as the newly-elected president delivered his first address to Congress on Tuesday evening.

And, back home, stars from the music and entertainment communities had their Twitter thumbs at the ready, as artists and actors scrutinized every word from the controversial POTUS.

In his first major speech since his inauguration last month,Â Trump called for an overhaul ofÂ the nation's health care system, hit on boosting military spending and talked of injectingÂ $1 trillion into upgrading crumbling infrastructure.Â Trump declared: "The time for small thinking is over," though his words didn't have the effect he was hoping for acrossÂ the broader celebrity community.
