Danielle Bregoli is a 13-year-old girl who gained viral fame after a star-making turn on The Dr. Phil Show in September 2016. During the show, about (surprise!) unruly teenagers, she spouted the catchphrase heard around the internet: "Cash me ousside, how bow dah?"

Now, just days after the ever-lit Bregoli was videotaped punching a fellow airline passenger, she has used up another of her 15 minutes moved her career in a new direction by starring in Kodak Black's new video for his song "Everything 1K."

The clip, which features just Bregoli and a dog—no Kodak in sight—has the teen counting money, hanging out in a Rolls Royce, half-heartedly lip-syncing, and just generally looking like a bored teenager. She is, of course, wearing her own merch (what, you thought a cross-promotion opportunity was going to go unused?)
