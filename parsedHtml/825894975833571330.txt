Opening Ceremony Presented a Protest-Inspired Ballet
Opening Ceremony Presented a Protest-Inspired Ballet 
Though Opening Ceremony ’s latest presentation occurred 12 days before NYFW, the event couldn’t have taken place at a more appropriate time. Soon after Donald Trump signed an executive order that temporarily banned Muslim nationals from migrating into the U.S., thousands of people across the country began protesting the controversial action. Amidst all the outcry and call for change, the minds behind Opening Ceremony were making their own political statement—one that encouraged diversity as well as civil disobedience. Rather than present their upcoming collection on the runway, designers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim decided to showcase their pieces in a politically charged ballet called The Times Are Racing." The performance was choreographed by Justin Peck, and starred members of the New York City Ballet Company decked out in the brand’s slogan tees. According to , the featured items were a part of OC’s Action capsule, and included shirts with words like “Defy,” “Protest,” “Unite,” and “Fight.” “We call them action words,” Leon told  . “With all these amazing kids onstage, it was about empowering youth and giving youth a voice. Those pieces were meant to be this call to action, the idea of giving freedom to each and every individual.” “That was very deliberate,” Lim added. This isn’t the first time OC has infused its fashion presentations with a strong political message. Last fall, the brand participated in NYFW with their "Pageant of the People,” a show that addressed the 2016 presidential race. And it’s very likely Leon and Lim will continue to use their brand to share their political opinions. "I think it’s a shame not to use this platform that we have to talk about something that’s on our minds," Leon told following last year’s show.
