LeBron James says his 12-year-old son is already better in certain ways than he was at his age


The NBA may one day again be dominated by a LeBron James.

If the early highlights are any indication, LeBron James' son, LeBron James Jr., has a bright future in basketball.

At 12 years old, in various highlight videos that can be found around the internet, James Jr. already has a natural feel for the game, splitting defenders to hit open teammates with on-the-mark passes, attacking the basket, and pulling up from deep.

In fact, at a recent tournament, LeBron James praised his son's passing and said certain aspects of his game are better than his when he was 12, according to The Cleveland Plain-Dealer's Chris Fedor.

"It's probably the best part of his game and I grew up playing basketball, playing AAU ball and watched a lot of kids kind of hog the ball. Not pass the ball and things of that nature and I was never one of those kids. I always liked seeing my teammates excited about getting the ball and making a shot so to see him doing the same thing, it's a pretty unique trait for a kid his age."

...

"I didn't handle the ball as well as he does. He handles the ball exceptionally and he shoots it a lot better than I did at that age, but I've always had the ability to pass the ball. It's good to see him doing it as well."

James Jr. already has the creativity on the fastbreak and ability to finish around people (highlights via TakeMyTalent.com):

And he runs the pick-and-roll like a pro:

ESPN reported over the summer that James Jr. hasÂ standing offers from Kentucky and Duke.

LeBron hasn't been thrilled with the early recruiting, saying, "It's pretty crazy. It should be a violation. You shouldn't be recruiting 10-year-old kids."Â

Still, if James Jr. continues to pursue basketball, it looks like we may be seeing even more of him as he rises up the basketball ranks.
