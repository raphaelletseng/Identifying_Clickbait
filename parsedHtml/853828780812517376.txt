Turkey referendum: Australian Turkish voters split over 'premature' result

Updated

Some members of Australia's Turkish community say they are upset and shocked Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has claimed victory so early in a referendum which will greatly expand his powers.

A member of the Turkish Opposition's Republican People's Party in Melbourne said the majority of the 14,000 Turkish Australians who cast their ballots voted No.

Alan Yildiz said it was premature for Mr Erdogan to declare victory, amid claims by opposition parties in Turkey that some 2.5 million votes were illegitimate.

He said some of the people who voted No in Australia thought there might be some attempts by the Turkish Government to engineer the results.

"The fact it is so blatant is why people are getting angry and quite upset within Australia in particular," Mr Yildiz said.

"You try hard and work within the law."

Mr Yildiz said the No camp clearly won in Australia.

"Melbourne is traditionally a heartland of support for President Erdogan's party the AKP or Justice and Development Party, so we are ecstatic at the No result coming out of Melbourne." Mr Yildiz said.

Winning side calls for unity in Australia

Sydney's Izzet Anmak, a member of Mr Erdogan's AKP party, called on the community to welcome the victory declaration.

"Both camps have expressed their democratic rights by voting in the referendum and we must accept the outcome, which we welcome," he said.

Mr Anmak said the Yes camp in Australia was celebrating.

"We respect both sides and see that as important for the future. We are all still dual citizens for Australia and the Turkish republic," he said.

"We will continue to support the stability and economic prosperity for the future of Turkey.

"Tonight there will be a quiet celebration outside the Gallipoli Mosque in Sydney's west, and we invite both the Yes and No camps to come along."

Impact of the overseas Turkish vote

The Turkish consulate in Melbourne said there are approximately 3 million Turkish voters outside Turkey â€” including Europe, the United States and Australia.

A spokesman said the overall participation rate in the referendum was 50 per cent.

He said around 59 per cent voted Yes and 40 per cent voted No.
