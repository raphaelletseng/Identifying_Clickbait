California Today: After Lawmaker’s Silencing, More Cries of ‘She Persisted’
The Democrats’ power in the State Capitol is ironclad. And it was wielded in startling fashion last week when a Republican state senator defied a demand to stop speaking and was physically removed from the Senate floor by law enforcement. The senator, Janet Nguyen, had stood up to criticize Tom Hayden, the 1960s radical, over his opposition to the Vietnam War. Days earlier, Mr. Hayden had been honored in the Capitol for his service in the Legislature. He died in October . But as Ms. Nguyen, who fled Communist Vietnam as a child, was speaking, the presiding senator declared her out of order. When she refused to sit, he summoned the sergeant-at-arms. Advertisement “Have her removed immediately,” said the senator, Ricardo Lara, a Democrat. California Today The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).

It was “the worst party ever.”

Still, by late October, they stood before the final mountain pass in the Sierra Nevada, just a day or two from civilization on the other side.

They were stuck. Through the winter months, the group descended into starvation, madness and, infamously, cannibalism. The last survivor, found surrounded by half eaten corpses, wasn’t rescued until mid-April. All told, 35 died during the winter encampment or trying to escape it.

Q. I get the sense that your book tries to normalize cannibalism. Is that right?

A. That’s a fine line to walk. If you’re not careful it sounds like you’re condoning that behavior. And I’m not. What I’m doing is taking a look at it through the eyes of a zoologist, of a scientist.

Q. What did you learn about human nature researching this story?

A. Just how strong and rugged these people were.

… They showed incredible bravery all along the way. There was individual heroism, group heroism on a scale that makes you glad that you’re human.

Q. Why do you think the Donner Party attracts such fascination?

A. They came so close to getting across that pass. They missed it by a night. And if you’ve ever stood in the Donner Pass and looked down and realized that they got this far — that blew me away.
