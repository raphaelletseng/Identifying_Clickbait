As everybody gets their brackets ready for the NCAA Tournament, some trends are starting to emerge as the most popular Final Four picks include three 1-seeds and one 2-seed.

According to ESPN.com's "Tournament Challenge" contest, No. 1 seed Kansas (Midwest regional) is the only team to appear in the Final Four of more than half of the 8 million brackets filled out so far. The most common Final Four picks in the other regions are No. 1 seed Villanova (East), No. 1 seed North Carolina (South), and second-seeded Arizona (West). Top seed Gonzaga has been picked to reach the Final Four in fewer than 35% of the brackets.

The most common pick for a school not seeded No. 6 or higher is Michigan, a seventh seed, picked in 5.1% of the brackets. The most common double-digit seed is Wichita State, reaching the Final Four in 1.7% of brackets.
