Updated

Four of David Bowie's final known recordings have been released to celebrate what would have been the legendary singer's 70th birthday.

A year on from the rock star's death, the artist is still very much front of mind for his fans around the world.

The never before heard tracks were released in a surprise EP titled No Plan, which includes songs Lazarus, Killing a Little Time, When I Met You as well as the title track.

"Look up here I'm in Heaven" is the opening verse to Lazarus.

What was believed to be Bowie's final album, Black Star, was released a year ago, two days before the singer lost his 18-month battle with cancer.

The singer now joins artists such as Johnny Cash, Janis Joplin, Otis Redding and Michael Jackson, who all released recordings after they had died.

Fans took to social media to share birthday wishes for the beloved music icon.
