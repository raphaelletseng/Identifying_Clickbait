Lorde's 'Green Light' Video Director Says Clip Feels 'Timeless to Me'  by   FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS  Lorde gets loose in the video for her new single, "Green Light," and according to the clip's director, the 20-year-old singer let go of all her inhibitions whileÂ filming. Speaking to , director Grant Singer said, "when I watch the video... I see her dancing and her vocal performance as completely interconnected and they're like one. She loses herself in the music." Singer described the pair's first meeting (a few months ago, at dinner in New York) before there was even talk of making a video.Â He said he was immediately struck by Lorde's passion , sincerity and thoughtfulness, whichÂ led to them collaborating on a video concept --Â even though he was still a bit nervous because of how much he respectedÂ her. "There was a lot of pressure for me because I adore her as a person, and when you see the passion and the artistry in someone that you respect you kind of take that responsibility on your own as a director," he said of the clip, which was shot in Los Angeles' MacArthur Park.  For her first video in several years, both wanted to make a clean break from Lorde's previous videos,Â which led to the bold artistic choice to shoot it on 16mm film rather than on the compact digital rigs typically employed these days. "To me, 16mm film has a thickness to it, and it feels timeless to me," Singer said. "And that was really important: to not make it feel like a video made in 2017, but to me the quality of the film, the music video itself feels more timely, and that was definitely intentional, at least on my part." Singer said Lorde improvised quite a bit, including the moment when she takes a payphone off the hook for no reason, which he wasn't even able to see until the film was developed. "To me, those are magic moments in a video, and to cut out of that would be criminal," he said. "I love that whole moment. It's all her. If you notice, it's synchronized with the beat in the song."Â Lorde tweeted about her own favorite unexpectedÂ bit, like when the cab driver is off to the side vaping as she dances on his car. my favourite part of the video is the driver standing off to one side vaping and watching me lose my shit on top of his car lol pic.twitter.com/iNWry1BTJg In the end, Singer felt that getting to know Lorde a bit beforehand and becoming friendly had a hugeÂ impactÂ on the final product. "Making this video was one of those times when even when we were shooting I just had a great feeling about it," he said. "I felt like we were making something really special. Everything just felt good. Everything just felt right." To read the full interview, click here Â and watch the "Green Light" video below.  FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS
