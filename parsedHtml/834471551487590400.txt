ESPN.com's Bradford Doolittle wrote the Rockets adding "one more small-role defender wouldn't be a bad idea" before the deadline.

Shumpert would fill that role in Houston. He's been a successful defender throughout his NBA tenure, though his defensive box plus-minus of 0.5 this season is the third-lowest mark of his career, per Basketball Reference.

It's unclear what the Rockets would have to give up to acquire Shumpert or if the Cavaliers even want to trade him with J.R. Smith still injured, so there is still work for general manager Daryl Morey to do.

The Rockets own the third-best record (40-18) in the Western Conference, behind only the Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs. The trade deadline is their last effort to make substantial additions to keep pace with those teams and potentially beat them in the playoffs.
