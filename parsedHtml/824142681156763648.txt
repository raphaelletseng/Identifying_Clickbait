Writing on Facebook, Mtokolo Limpo said: 'Zambian women are a disgrace, you come all the way to dine with an old man.

'What special attention are you going to give him apart from sucking up his money.'

Nice couple, I see nothing wrong if they love each other

While Longlu Vlami added: 'It is sad that women nowadays don't know how to work hard but just find a life with a finished old man, very soon he is dying and she will inherit his riches.'

And Mercy Nhlovu added: 'That girl must be taken back to Zambia. Rubbish!'

But not everybody was against the match as Tulani Zulu' commented: 'Nice couple, I see nothing wrong if they love each other.'
