Nancy Pelosi: I Don't Think Democrats 'Want A New Direction' - Breitbart
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Sunday on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” when asked about the direction of the Democratic Party, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) downplayed the possibility of a new direction. FOR OUR NEWSLETTER DICKERSON: The Democratic party is in a moment of questioning about its identity. You were reelected to lead the Democrats in the house. What do you tell Democrats who want a new direction and what are you going to do differently? PELOSI: I don’t think people want a new direction. Our values unify us and our values are about supporting America’s working families. that’s one that everyone is in agreement on. What we want is a better connection of our message to working families in our country, and that clearly in the election showed that that message wasn’t coming through. But we are united in terms of the security of our country, which is our first responsibility. To be smart and strong and not reckless in how we protect the American people, strong in how we protect our economy. DICKERSON: Here’s my question, though, Democrats since 2008, the numbers are ghastly for Democrats. Democrats are down 10%, in the house down 19.3% and in governors 35%. The Democrats are getting clobbered at every level over multiple elections. That seems like a real crisis for the party? PELOSI:  You’re forgetting that we went up so high in 2006 2008, and let me just put that in perspective. When President Clinton was elected, Republicans came in big in the next election. When president Bush was president, we came in big in the next election. When President Obama became president, the Republicans came in big in the next election.
