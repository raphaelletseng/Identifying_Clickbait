The Insider Pick:

Choosing the right SD card can be confusing. After lots of research, we found that the SanDisk Extreme PRO 95MB/s UHS-I/U3 SDXC Card is best for most people.

Unless you're an avid photographer, buying the right SD card can be mystifying. You have to take a variety of specifications into consideration when you buy an SD card: card type, speed, capacity, and more.

We researched reviews across the web to find the best SD cards you can buy. We've broken down all the terms and specs so you know how to choose the right SD card for your needs.Â

Whether you're an amateur who's learning, a pro who shoots in RAW all the time, or a videographer who films in 4K, we've got you covered.

Card Type

When it comes to the card type, the two main kinds you'll want to consider are SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) and SDXC (Secure Digital eXtended Capacity). The only real difference between the two is how much storage they offer. SDHC cards contain 4GB to 32GB, while SDXC cards typically range from 64GB to 2TB.Â

Capacity

Chances are, you'll want an SD card with more than 32GB of storage, so you'll be looking at SDXC cards. A 32GB card is fine for casual photographers or people who prefer to have multiple smaller-capacity cards for security (if you lose your card, you don't lose everything). We typically recommendÂ 64GB cards in this guide because you'll want that extra space for high-resolution photographs and video.

Speed Class

Speed class is where things get complicated. The chart from the SD Association on the right breaks it down visually, but we've explained below.

SD cards for your average user come in four speed classes: 10, 6, 4, and 2. Â Class 2 cards are the slowest and class 10 cards are the fastest. The class number refers to write speeds in megabytes per second (MB/s), so Class 2 = 2MB/s, Class 4 = 4MB/s, Class 6 = 6MB/s, and Class 10 = 10MB/s.Â

It's generally a good idea to get a high-speed SD card, especially if you are shooting in RAW or filming high-resolution video. In that case, you'll wantÂ a class 10 SD card with a UHS (Ultra High Speed) classification.Â

UHS refers to the absolute top theoretical speed of each card. It's a good way to gauge burst shot speeds. UHS-I Cards have a maximum speed of 104 MB/s, while UHS-II cards have a maximum speed of 312 MB/s.

Finally, there's the card's speed class rating of either U1 or U3 on the top high-end cards. The speed class rating tells you the minimum speed an SD card will write. In other words, your card will never write at a speed slower than its rating. U1 supports at least a 10MB/s write speed, and U3 cards offer at least a 30MB/s write speed. If you shoot in 4K a lot, you have to get a U3 SD card.Â

All the SD cards in this guide are U3 or U1.

You'll want to check to be sure your camera supports those speeds. Otherwise, you won't get the full effect of the card. Avoid counterfeit cards by sticking with known brands and clicking on our links.
