Trump’s Syria Strike Has Some Critics Cheering and Some Fans Booing
WASHINGTON — His longstanding critics cheered. Some of his supporters were horrified. President Trump’s decision to launch cruise missiles at an air base in Syria in retaliation for a horrific chemical weapons attack perpetrated by the Syrian government scrambled reactions across the political spectrum. On the set of “Morning Joe,” the MSNBC program whose hosts have had a tortured relationship with Mr. Trump, the strike was well received by one of the president’s sharpest Republican critics, Senator John McCain of Arizona. Mr. McCain praised what he said was Mr. Trump’s apparent adherence to advice from the three generals in the administration: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary; and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the president’s national security adviser, the only one still on active duty. “Obviously he listened to that team, and that’s what’s most encouraging to me, is that he respects Mattis, he respects McMaster, he respects Kelly,” Mr. McCain said.

Another frequent Trump antagonist, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, offered measured support for the strike. So did Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who has been deeply critical of Mr. Trump’s muted language on Russia.

But shortly before the strike, she said in an interview at the Women in the World event in New York that she believed the United States should try to destroy the air force of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. “Assad has an air force, and that air force is the cause of most of these civilian deaths as we have seen over the years and as we saw again in the last few days,” Mrs. Clinton said. “And I really believe that we should have and still should take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.” Advertisement The Senate’s Democratic minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, who has been at odds with Mr. Trump on any number of issues, said he supported the president’s actions in this instance. “Making sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do,” Mr. Schumer wrote on Twitter soon after the strike. Leon E.
