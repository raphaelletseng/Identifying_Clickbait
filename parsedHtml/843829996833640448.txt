Twitter Turned An Old Photo Of Meryl Streep Into An Incredible Meme
Meryl Streep is an Oscar-winning actress and, according to Twitter, a great singer. It all started with a photo taken in 2015. The “Florence Foster Jenkins” star was snapped cheering on the late Debbie Reynolds as she received a lifetime-achievement award at the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Awards. The photo has inexplicably gone through a renaissance in the past few days and has become a Twitter meme. A meme that involves Streep yelling a song lyric.
