A head-on car crash about 100 kilometres north of Perth that caused a vehicle to roll over has left one man in a critical condition and six others hospitalised.

Police said the two cars collided around 1:00pm on Sunday on Indian Ocean Drive in Breton Bay, near Ledge Point.

St John Ambulance, Department of Fire and Emergency Services, two rescue helicopters and police attended the crash scene.

One person trapped inside the overturned car had to be freed.

One man was taken to Royal Perth Hospital by helicopter, where he remains in a critical condition.

The second helicopter transferred another man and woman to Royal Perth, where they are believed to be in a serious but stable condition.

A fourth person was taken to Royal Perth by ambulance by road. It is understood they were also in a serious but stable condition.

Three others — two women and one man — were taken to Joondalup hospital all in stable conditions.

The accident caused traffic delays with Indian Ocean Drive closed in both directions at Greenwood Coast Road and traffic diverted to an alternate route for part of the afternoon.
