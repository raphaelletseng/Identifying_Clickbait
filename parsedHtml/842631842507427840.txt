Story highlights 4-year-old continues to charm after crashing dad's interview

People have literally made fan art of her

(CNN) Meet Marion Kelly, your new viral hero. The 4-year-old is the daughter of professor Robert Kelly, who was just trying to do an interview on the BBC last week when Marion danced into the room and stole the show.

Also, look at how daggone cute this family is.

The internet has not stopped thinking about the moment, which spoke deeply to parents and victims of remote interview foolery alike. On Wednesday, the Kelly family held a press conference in South Korea to talk about their fame and how exactly the whole moment went down.

They said some charming stuff but once again, all eyes were on Marion, looking for all the world like a little Arthur clone in a trench coat and baby pink glasses.

People were loving it.

They wanted to BE her, this little force of chaos that no well-prepared interview or expertise on South Korean politics could stop.
