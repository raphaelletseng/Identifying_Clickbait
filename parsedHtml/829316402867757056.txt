Be it her commercial hits like Biwi No.1 and Main Hoon Na or critically acclaimed film Samay, she has time and again proved that she is made to sizzle and shine on the big screen. In a recent interview, Sushmita Sen spoke about the change in the roles essayed by women in the Hindi film industry. Talking about the same, an IANS report quotes the actress saying,

"As far as a conscious decision goes, it's really an amalgamation of a lot of things... It's just that I made a choice this time. To be a mum, that was very much a part of every little detail of a second child being brought up, and she's (Alisah is) now seven. It's the kind of scripts and the films that were coming my way... I chose to utilise my time more productively. I understand and respect the need for us to constantly follow a system of films after films, but the truth of the matter is, I had to choose and prioritise, and I chose... this."
