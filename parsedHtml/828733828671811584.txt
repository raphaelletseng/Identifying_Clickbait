The backlash against the travel ban on seven mostly Muslim countries includes a legal brief filed by almost 100 firms including Apple, Facebook and Google's parent company, Alphabet, arguing the measure inflicts significant harm on American business.

Oil prices also fell overnight because of a stronger US dollar and predictions of ample crude supplies throughout the United States.

A Bloomberg survey published before the Energy Information Administration report (due out tomorrow), revealed the median estimate was for US crude supplies to have grown by 2.5 million barrels last week.

Analysts forecast the report will show that US fuel stockpiles rose, while refineries cut operating rates.

In corporate news, shares in toymaker Hasbro jumped almost 17 per cent to a record high, after the company's quarterly results beat expectations.

The company reported strong demand for Disney princess dolls and its board games during the pre-Christmas shopping period.

Shares in upmarket jeweller Tiffany & Co lost value after its chief executive, Frederic Cumenal, stepped down on the back of disappointing financial results.

In November, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, but last month it said that holiday sales were lower than anticipated.

Mr Cumenal's departure is effective immediately and the search has begun to replace him.

No 'smoking gun' for falls

IG's chief market strategist Chris Weston circulated some analysis, saying there was no clear reason for the weakness on Wall Street.

"There has been somewhat of a risk-off tone to markets, although there doesn't seem to be a smoking gun and there really is no panic," he wrote.

Trading in Europe was dominated by the upcoming French presidential elections.

Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen launched her campaign over the weekend, promising to remove France from the eurozone and readopt the French franc currency if she won.

The European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, was also fighting criticism from the US on currency manipulation.

NAB's director of economics David de Garis wrote in a note that Mr Draghi had a battle on his hands.

"He must have felt besieged on all fronts, telling the European Parliament that the euro is irrevocable, that the ECB had not intervened in currency markets since 2011, while assuring markets that the central bank will continue with its bond purchase program to support growth," he wrote.

"He downplayed any sensitivity to last week's inflation read, noting that it was primarily energy and not European wages and fundamentals and he also said, if the outlook were to worsen, they could step up bond purchases again."
