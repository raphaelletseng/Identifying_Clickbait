A van and a ute have collided and caught fire on a highway in eastern Thailand, killing 25 people.

The public transit van lost control and crossed the grass median, colliding with the ute heading in the opposite direction on Monday afternoon, according to Thai Road Accident Data for Road Safety Culture.

Twenty-five people were killed and two survived the crash, said police officer Dusadee Kunchorn Na Ayutthaya, superintendent of the Ban Bung district police station in Chonburi province.

"An accident like this shouldn't happen but it did," he said.

Both drivers were killed.

Police were not yet able to interview the survivors but were investigating to determine what caused the crash.

Thailand has one of the highest traffic fatality rates in the world.
