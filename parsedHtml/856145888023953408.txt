Miley Cyrus is in Marvel's next movie — and she may be coming back for another one
Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Cyrus is the voice of Mainframe in a post-credits scene, as first reported by blogger Sarah Ruhlman .                                  "I was admiring the tone of Miley Cyrus's voice," Gunn told BuzzFeed News of judge. "I find her funny and likable and sweet. I liked that she cared about the contestants. So I was like, I think she would be a funny person to have as a voice [in ]. So we contacted her, and she said yes. She came in and recorded, and she was a delight to work with."                                  "She knows that there's a chance that character may go on and become a bigger thing," Gunn said. "That's a possibility."                                  "I'm excited by the possibility of doing more stuff with that particular set of characters," Gunn said. "I think we're all looking forward to what is the Marvel Universe going to be after , and that storyline comes to an end."                                  "Listen, Mainframe is barely a character in the comics. My concept of who Mainframe could be is actually pretty far out." He chuckled. "I didn't know Mainframe from the comics, so I knew Miley Cyrus wouldn't." Adam B. Vary is a senior film reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles. Contact Adam B.
