Ebony Banks, a senior at Alief Hastings High School in Houston, had one big wish.

Banks, a member of the color guard who is known to friends as "Ebob," hasn't been in school much this year. She's fighting Stage 4 cancer, and her condition was serious enough that the school had to hold a special graduation ceremony for her at a local hospital. But through it all, Ebony wanted to meet her hometown hero, Beyoncé. (For context, Banks is a big enough fan that one of her friends recalled the teen "crying like somebody in her family had died" when she got Bey tickets).

"She is a really big fan of [Beyoncé] and she has so much love for her that we really want to get [Banks] to meet her," fellow senior Cristal Depaz told a local ABC affiliate. So Banks' friends started the hashtag #EBOBMEETSBEYONCE, and it actually got some traction—lots of retweets and some area press coverage.

And things probably would have ended there, except that this is Beyoncé we're talking about. So just days after the story started to pick up, Banks' wish came true on Wednesday when Bey FaceTimed her. You can see video from the conversation above.

Banks' community, and of course Beyhive members around the world, were moved by the conversation.

So happy for my former student getting her final wish. Keep her in your prayers❤️ #ebobmeetsbeyonce https://t.co/p6z5ETjwPX — Mario Morales ( @MrMoralesband ) March 23, 2017
