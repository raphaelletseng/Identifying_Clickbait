Woman killed during exorcism after fake 'spiritual healers' beat her


A woman has died after two supposed Muslim holy men carried out a fake exorcism on her by tying her upside down to a tree and beating her with sticks.

Nazar Hussain, from Sajjadabad in Punjab, Pakistan, took his wife Suriya Begum to nearby Naurangabad for spiritual healing, where two fake holy men, known as pirs, told him that his wife required exorcism.

The fake spiritual healers, identified as Amaanullah and Abdul Hameed, then set upon Suriya, tying her to a tree and beating her with sticks.

The men then continued with the fake exorcism by tying her upside-down and throwing smoke at her as she screamed in pain, Geo TV reports.

Hussain claims he tried to stop the 'exorcism' after he watched his wife screaming in agony, but both of the fake holy men refused to stop.

Suriya was taken to hospital in Dera Ghazi Khan in a critical condition, but doctors pronounced her dead upon arrival.

According to police, the body is due to undergo a post-mortem examination, after which the suspects are set to be arrested.

In May last year an 'exorcist' raped and tortured a 16-year-old Pakistani girl for four days to 'rid her of demons' - and then told her mother 'evil spirits' broke the teenager's neck.

The girl, named locally as Sara, was taken to the man by her mother, who believed the exorcist, or 'pir', would cure her stomach and psychiatric problems.

But instead, her daughter was returned to her dead, with the exorcist blaming it on the 'djinn', or evil spirits, who had possessed her.
