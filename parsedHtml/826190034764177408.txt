All the best protest signs from the weekend of Muslim ban demonstrations
More protests erupted this weekend in response to President Trump's executive order , signed on Friday, which indefinitely barred Syrian refugees and temporarily banned travel into the U.S. from citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. And, yet again , protesters brought some great signs.

Unsurprisingly, the protests of this past weekend were coupled with tons of creative signage. The messages ranged from humorous to angered, and many were rooted in the theme that immigrants and people of all races should be welcomed in America. There were also signs protesting Trump directly and calling for his impeachment. Protesters rallied behind #MuslimBan and #NoBanNoWall to spread these powerful signs around social media. this is by far the realest sign #lax  #NoBanNoWall  pic.twitter.com/AQ81yRcJI7 — Rogue PressSecretary (@runolgarun) January 29, 2017 This guy has a fair point. #NoBanNoWall  pic.twitter.com/hC8MWRsY1s — Amanda Rykoff (@amandarykoff) January 29, 2017 Best signs yet. #NoBanNoWall  #LAX  pic.twitter.com/m7P6D9U7Cz — Bryan Behar (@bryanbehar) January 30, 2017 When snowflakes create a blizzard. ❤️❄️ #NoBanNoWall  pic.twitter.com/aiUFPWPiM7 — Ricky Davila (@TheRickyDavila) January 29, 2017 Things are winding down here at the #MuslimBan protest at #ATL , so it’s time for some best-of-show protest signs. pic.twitter.com/A8klnGsnex — Daniel Funke (@dpfunke) January 30, 2017 Favorite sign at the protest #MuslimBan  pic.twitter.com/L3a9STyrz4 — Bri (@Bre2286) January 30, 2017 This guy❤ #copleysquare  #NoBanNoWall  pic.twitter.com/4z1rTf7OPC — ynna kutney (@ynnapadilla) January 29, 2017 "Will trade 1 Donald Trump for 10,000 refugees" #NoBanNoWall  #nomuslimban  pic.twitter.com/WzoVDsv5bt — Jackie Vimo (@JackieVimo) January 29, 2017 @DrJayDrNo I see your best sign ever and raise you this #truthbomb  pic.twitter.com/HK8QXKwAxw — Cam Sweet (@hardassets4all) January 29, 2017 "Did I Stutter?" for the win!

More protests erupted this weekend in response to President Trump's executive order, signed on Friday, which indefinitely barred Syrian refugees and temporarily banned travel into the U.S. from citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.

And, yet again, protesters brought some great signs.

While the Women's March took place in streets and parks, the Muslim ban protests extended to major airports across the U.S. as stories have surfaced of people already being detained due to the ban.

Unsurprisingly, the protests of this past weekend were coupled with tons of creative signage. The messages ranged from humorous to angered, and many were rooted in the theme that immigrants and people of all races should be welcomed in America. There were also signs protesting Trump directly and calling for his impeachment.
