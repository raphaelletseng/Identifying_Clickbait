UPDATE: Feb. 24 ― A short video clip shared Friday on Snapchat by Kourtney Kardashian panned across a photograph, hanging in sister Khloe’s home, of a woman on a cross. The photo prompted speculation that it was Kourtney herself who appeared in the photo (this article previously stipulated as much).

Rather, the photo very strongly resembles a work by British photographer Terry O’Neill, “Raquel Welch on the Cross, Los Angeles,” for which she wore a costume from the 1966 film “One Million Years B.C.”

It appears Kourtney Kardashian is taking notes from Yeezus.

On Friday, the mother-of-three shared a clip on her Snapchat, walking viewers through her sister Khloe’s home. At one point, she goes up the stairs to reveal what appears to be a large framed photo of herself in the image of Jesus crucified on the cross, just casually hanging on the wall.

The Kardashians have not hidden their Christian beliefs ― they were the topic of an interview with Oprah in 2012 ― but we’re going to go ahead and say this probably doesn’t represent living in the image of God.
