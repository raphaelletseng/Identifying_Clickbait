Campaign to preserve 'Queen's' Malta cathedral
Campaign to preserve 'Queen's' Malta cathedral - BBC News


An appeal has been launched to save a cathedral on Malta where Queen Elizabeth II used to worship.

After World War II, the then-Princess Elzabeth lived on the Mediterranean island while Prince Philip was stationed there as a Royal Naval officer.

Now St Paul's Anglican Pro-Cathedral in Valetta is in need of a €3m (£2.6m) renovation.
