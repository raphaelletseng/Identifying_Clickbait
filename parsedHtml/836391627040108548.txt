Irene Clennell, a woman married to a British man for 27 years, has been sent back to Singapore.

She tells the BBC she was unable to contact her lawyer and did not have the chance to get any clothes from her home.

Periods spent abroad caring for her parents are thought to have invalidated her residential status in the UK.
