THE INSURTECH REPORT: How financial technology firms are helping â and disrupting â the nearly $5 trillion insurance industry


The global insurance industry is worth nearlyÂ $5 trillion, and insurance companies are at risk of losing a share of this valuable market to new entrants. That's because these legacy playersÂ have beenÂ even slower to modernize than their counterparts in other financial services industries.Â

This has created an opportunity for a group of firms known as insurtechs. These startups are leveraging new technology and a better understanding of consumer expectations to increase efficiencies in the insurance industry. Some are helping incumbents deliver better end products, while others are directly competing with legacy players.

In a new report from BI Intelligence, we lookÂ atÂ the drivers behind the increasing number of insurtech companies, how they are helping or disrupting legacy players in the insurance industry, and where legacy players are innovating off their own backs.Â
