The OVO Unruly fan club has done this before. Back around when Drake and Future’s What a Time To Be Alive dropped, they hit Meek’s Insta with a bunch of diamond emojis. Meek Mill barely uses Twitter anymore, so we doubt he’ll respond.

Also, this has to suck for Meek: Nicki Minaj promoting More Life on her Instagram.
