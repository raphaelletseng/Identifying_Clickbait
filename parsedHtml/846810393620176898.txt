Which teams have the best, worst management? Power Rankings: A demotion for the defending champs NBA playoff push: There's a new king in the East Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Pinterest Email comment Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Pinterest Email print comment We're ranking every front office in the NBA, and -- surprise, surprise -- the San Antonio Spurs , who will be making their 20th straight playoff appearance, are No. 1. We asked our ESPN Forecast panel to rate every team's owner, basketball decision-maker(s) and coach from 0 to 10, and we then asked the panel to tell us how important each role is. In particular, we asked the voters to rate each team's front-office management on its guidance and leadership in terms of how it affects overall on-court success, both in the short and long term. From there, we calculated the ratings to determine the NBA's best and worst front offices. We'll break out the three categories -- coaches, team presidents/general managers and owners -- from Wednesday to Friday. Today, we unveil our overall rankings, from top to bottom.
