Tyrese Issues Apology After Getting Dragged for ‚ÄòPromiscuous Women‚Äô Comments
Tyrese ignited the wrath of social media this week after making controversial comments about ‚Äúoverly aggressive promiscuous women.‚Äù And it appears the 38-year-old actor is now trying to clean up the mess. During a promotional tour for his new film , Tyrese sat down with BET for an interview that included a controversial rant about the way women conduct themselves:  To absolutely no one‚Äôs surprise, the comments were immediately criticized on social media. Outspoken talkshow host Wendy Williams also blasted Tyrese, asking: ‚ÄúWho made him the moral police?‚Äù The backlash, which was apparently too much for the actor to handle, has led him to issue a public apology. My mother taught me better than this ‚Ä¶ lesson learned in life you will learn that It's not always "what" you say, it's the "how" we choose to say it. For the record I'm far from a misogynist, a male chauvinist or flat out mean ‚Ä¶ My intentions were there but my delivery fucking horrible ‚Ä¶ And clearly all the way off ‚Ä¶ And for that I sincerely apologize to all of the ladies [‚Ä¶] I have never experienced what I am experiencing right now. - I've been getting dragged and feel the heat from my poor choice of words and approach to my messages, trust me. My mother taught me better than this..... lesson learned in life you will learn that It's not always "what" you say, it's the "how" we choose to say it. For the record I'm far from a misogynist, a male chauvinist or flat out mean..... My intentions were there but my delivery fucking horrible.... And clearly all the way off.... And for that I sincerely apologize to all of the ladies... Even after this apology.... Some may likely decide to NOT forgive me.... Time and consistency heals all wounds.... Although I've been consistently for years speaking on these topics and some of the same words in my message, I have never experienced what I am experiencing right now. - I've been getting dragged and feel the heat from my poor choice of words and approach to my messages, trust me..... Please accept this as my sincere apology for my poor choice of words - Shit gets real when it goes from a social media dragging to my own wife giving me the side eye and coming at me, even she's not happy with the way I've conducted myself.... it's crazy how non-public figures can say and do some really dumb shit and it will stay amongst your family and friends or local in your hood.... When you have been an entertainer for 15+ years the whole WORLD is literally watching you grow up & learn, bump your head, make mistakes and evolve as the world watches.... This is a real lesson learned... This is not just a regular IG post for me. I want to truly say that I'm sorry, I'm not APOLOGIZING in an effort to be politically correct, I apologize as a man first for the things that I've recently said about choices women have the right to make, for the terms that I've used and the way I've come across. I was raised to think and feel certain ways, and I'm learning new things that combat those messages. I am not perfect or all knowing, nor am I the one to claim to be. I've learned things through experience which I share, and through these last couple of weeks, I've learned a lot through this well deserved internet dragging...... This is about a man owning up to his actions, taking responsibility, recognizing how to do better, and actually doing better. Ladies you deserve better...

Tyrese ignited the wrath of social media this week after making controversial comments about ‚Äúoverly aggressive promiscuous women.‚Äù And it appears the 38-year-old actor is now trying to clean up the mess.

During a promotional tour for his new film Fate of the Furious, Tyrese sat down with BET for an interview that included a controversial rant about the way women conduct themselves:

‚ÄúI appreciate all the ladies out there that are still single, that are holding out. Don't settle. Don't settle. Though his message didn‚Äôt start out offensive, things quickly took a left turn. ‚ÄúI'm gonna tell you all right now, and this might be harsh: Sluts, skeezers, hoes, tramps and overly aggressive promiscuous women, they are never without a man because they don't have no standards. They ready to have sex with any and everything that want to have sex with them [‚Ä¶] You have women that are active out in these streets, they going to lunches and dinners every night. Private planes, mega yachts, it's cracking. They're never without. However, it comes with a cost, you gonna put a lot of miles on yourself down there, come on."

To absolutely no one‚Äôs surprise, the comments were immediately criticized on social media. Outspoken talkshow host Wendy Williams also blasted Tyrese, asking: ‚ÄúWho made him the moral police?‚Äù The backlash, which was apparently too much for the actor to handle, has led him to issue a public apology.
