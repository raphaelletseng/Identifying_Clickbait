Yahoo's Q1 earnings report, due to be released after Tuesday's market close, will likely represent the company's final report before it is acquired by Verizon.

First, the scorecard.

Here's what analysts are expecting. We'll have the final numbers as soon as they cross the wire.

Net Revenue (excluding traffic acquisition costs):Â $814 million, down 5% year-on-year

EPS (adjusted):Â $0.14

This marks the end of an era for Yahoo. After the Verizon deal closes, Marissa Mayer will step down as CEO with a severance package worth about $23 million.

Yahoo will then combine with AOL, which is also owned by Verizon, and the combined company will be calledÂ Oath. (Yes, that's the real name.) Oath will be the parent company while the AOL and Yahoo brands live on for stuff like news, email, and other media Oath can sell digital ads against.
