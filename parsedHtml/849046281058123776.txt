Young Thug's lawyers are the real co-MVPs in his life right now.

According to TMZ, Young Thug was able to thwart a felony drug charge stemming from a raid conducted by authorities at his Sandy Springs, Georgia home in July 2015. After cops found weapons and drugs inside his residence, Thugger was charged with felony cocaine possession, felony marijuana possession and three counts of felony gun possession.

Between then and now, Thug's lawyers managed to get the district attorney to bring it down to a felony drug charge. Then, his attorneys helped Thugger Euro-step his way around that charge by arguing that the cops carried out a search of the rapper's premises without a proper warrant. The D.A. agreed, and dropped everything.

On Sunday, Thug posted a couple possible sub-tweets which could have been in reference to getting that last charge dropped.
