There Are More Than 60,000 Species Of Trees In The World, And Over 10,000 Of Them May Go Extinct Soon
There Are More Than 60,000 Species Of Trees, Sadly Over 10,000 Of Them May Go Extinct Soon
There Are More Than 60,000 Species Of Trees In The World, And Over 10,000 Of Them May Go Extinct Soon For the first time, a database has compiled a tally of all the world’s tree species, a number that is higher than 60,000. According to GlobalTreeSearch, there are 60,065 species of trees in the world. Scientists from Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) spent two years on constructing this data. Writing for the Journal of Sustainable Forestry, they said this is the first data of its kind to be produced by the research world. Paul Smith, BGCI executive, said, “This database will be hugely useful for us in prioritising which ones we need to do conservation action on, and which ones we need to do assessments to find out what their status is.” The website said, “Our intention is for GlobalTreeSearch to be used as a tool for monitoring and managing tree species diversity, forests and carbon stocks on a global, regional or national level.” According to their research, 58% of tree species, or 8,751, grow in Brazil, which is the highest number in the world. This needs Brazil to act with caution because any catastrophe in the country will result in their extinction. Already 10,000 species are vulnerable to extinction such as the Karomia gigas in Tanzania
