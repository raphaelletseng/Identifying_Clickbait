People Love This Girl's Joyous Response To Her Boyfriend Gifting Her An Empty Box
This is 21-year-old Braxton Sislo from New Orleans. He met his girlfriend, a 20-year-old Canadian named Ray, on Twitter, so it seems fairly appropriate their relationship has garnered a bit of a following on the platform. Sislo works at a shop that sells cell phone accessories and last week his boss handed him an empty box that a new phone had arrived in, thinking he might be able to reuse the packaging. “Oh maybe Ray can use this for stuff,” Sislo said he thought. So he texted his girlfriend a photo of it and explained, “It’s just a box.” Sislo thought his girlfriend would respond a simple “thanks” to the gesture. But instead, Ray was not only grateful, but she seemed genuinely elated and excited about the box. “I was both surprised and not surprised by her reaction,” Sislo told BuzzFeed News. “She’s always been a woman that is grateful for the little things… But at the same time I wasn’t expecting of that,” he said, laughing. Sislo found his girlfriend’s response so endearing, he shared it on Twitter, where it’s since gone viral. For obvious reasons, people are calling their relationship “goals.” This was my girl's reaction to me giving her an empty box @Braxtation goals bro @Braxtation @Cjlong5 she grateful af @Braxtation never let her go 😭😭she so cute oml A lot of men copied Sislo’s texts to see how their significant others would react to receiving an empty box. Results…varied. @Braxtation @Braxtation Although some were also pleasantly surprised by responses they received.
