For Germany, Trump Poses a Problem With No Clear Solution
For Germany, Trump Poses a Problem With No Clear Solution
BERLIN — As allies across Europe and Asia adjust to changes brought by President Trump, Germany is in a uniquely difficult position. Its economy and national security are particularly reliant on American support, which now seems in doubt, and on European unity, which is under attack and increasingly up to Germany to maintain. Yet Germany is constrained by the growing shakiness of allies like Britain and perhaps even France, by the rise of its own far-right populist movement and by lingering cultural sensitivities about any policy that feels militaristic or hegemonic. These dynamics are not new, but there is a growing tension between the role Germany feels comfortable with, and the one it feels it needs to play on the world stage. A growing number of officials in Germany are asking whether they need a Plan B for a post-American Europe. But they are finding that any such plan would require costs and sacrifices almost as great as the consequences of inaction.

The concern vexing Mr. Annen, and much of official Berlin, was that Mr. Trump might not only withdraw American protection but also actively aid Europe’s growing internal and external threats. “Someone like Mr. Bannon sitting in the White House who has contacts with right-wing, up to fascist, groups here in Europe,” Mr. Annen said, referring to Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, “is really concerning.” He also said he feared that Mr. Trump could seek to improve ties with Moscow “on Russian terms,” cutting out Europe, and potentially emboldening Russia’s growing challenge to the continent’s unity. Other lawmakers worried that Mr. Trump was already undermining European unity, for example by rewarding Britain’s exit from the European Union with promises of a speedy trade deal. “What I find destabilizing is his announcement that he will make deals with national member states, because that will divide the E.U.,” said Franziska Brantner, a lawmaker with the Green Party. She also said she was worried that Mr. Trump was weakening Europe’s collective defense by questioning the value of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A new German role Most nations, facing such threats, would most likely be moving to respond. Germany is unusual. It has secured its place in the world by upholding the liberal order through consensus-building and peacemaking. Advertisement “That’s a nice idea,” Ulrich Kühn, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said of that model. But Germany “is being confronted with a reality where we cannot continue that way anymore.” Most middle powers rely at least partly on traditional forms of power; Britain has its military might, India its regional dominance, Israel its nuclear program. Germany has explicitly avoided such assets, leaving it to rely on soft power tools, particularly its economic strength, that only work in the framework of a liberal European order that now looks uncertain. Now, policy elites and the public in Germany are struggling with whether and how their nation should develop more traditional forms of power. Germany has, in the past decade, grown beyond many of the taboos that stem from the Nazi era and World War II . It leads on eurozone matters, sends small numbers of troops on overseas NATO missions and has organized recent sanctions against Russia. National pride remains a touchy topic but one that can at least be discussed. Still, the idea of Germany as a military power or even European hegemon — likely requirements for taking up the burdens and responsibilities of a leading European power in the Trump era — remains difficult. But Germany may not have the luxury of time to reconcile its contradictory feelings about its place in the world, especially with an intransigent America and resurgent Russia, and a Europe rived by populism. “We still don’t really have a clue who we are in the world and who we want to be,” said Jana Puglierin of the German Council on Foreign Relations. That makes it difficult to face increasingly urgent questions, she said, over “what role we should play, who Germany is, how dominant do we want to be.” Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.
