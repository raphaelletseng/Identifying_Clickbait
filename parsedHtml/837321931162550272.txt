Pound sterling to stay at record lows even after Article 50 is triggered
Economists have warned the battered pound is set to continue trading at record lows even once Prime Minister Theresa May ’s government triggers official proceeding to exit the EU . Ms May said she intends to trigger Article 50 later this month, effectively starting the formal divorce proceedings with the EU. But according to a poll of more than 60 banks and research institutions conducted by Reuters, sterling, which is already down 17 per cent against the dollar and 12 per cent against the euro since the Brexit vote, will not recover any time soon.   This is what happened to the pound since Brexit Most economists predict the pound will continue to trade at $1.23 against the dollar in one month, and drop to $1.21 in the next three to six months. Against the euro, sterling is expected to trade between 85 pence and 87 pence at the same period-ends, according to Reuters. Clearer sign that the US central bank is preparing to raise interest rates later in March should also favour the dollar over sterling in coming months, accentuating the pound’s weakness. "GBP/USD will come under further downward pressure on a Fed interest rate rise as the negative US-UK interest rate differentials widen," Richard Grace, FX analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told Reuters.
