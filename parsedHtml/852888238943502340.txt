Cheapest places to buy an overseas holiday home revealed


The best value places for Britons to buy a holiday home overseas have been revealed in a new list, with Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece topping the rankings.

The prospect of a £91,000 Bulgarian bolthole tops a list that feels like a throwback to the heady days of the early 2000s property boom - an era when daytime TV schedules were awash with programmes featuring far-flung holiday homes.

While most Britons buying abroad opt for Spain or France, the research by currency card specialist FairFX delivered a top ten of alternative destinations where the average home is cheapest.

The report found that Bulgaria was the most affordable country to buy a second home in, with an average price of £90,734.

It is followed by Turkey and Greece, which have average house values of £104,225 and £118,921 respectively.

Those compare to the most expensive destinations, which include Monaco, Switzerland and Belgium.

The research by international currency provider FairFX went on to highlight that the cost of a property is only one factor buyers need to consider when looking overseas, with political, economic and cultural situations also important.

The cheapest places overseas for holiday homebuyers also include Hungary, Cyprus and Portugal.

The report found that average property values for these countries are £205,499, £214,027 and £217,915 respectively.

Ian Strafford-Taylor, chief executive of FairFX, said: 'Our research allows potential second home buyers to weigh up which country is the best value - looking at the average cost of an apartment, as well as the essential elements you need once you are there.

'To get the best value, it is important to take all living costs into account as well as how much a property will cost initially.

'It's also vital that you research the region you are buying in.

'Keeping abreast of the political and economic situation in that destination will help you decide if the property is a good long-term investment.'

At the same time, FairFX also compiled a weekly essentials list for each country, including the price of a litre of milk, a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs, along with water and a bottle of wine.

The list showed that residents in the Bahamas can expect to pay four times more for essentials than those living in the Czech Republic.

FairFX claimed these additional costs also need to be considered when making a decision about where to buy a second home.

Perhaps the most important thing to consider, however, was not included - the ease and cost of getting to the destination.

This plays a major part in how often people can use their holiday home and what the annual cost of doing so adds up to. It can also affect a holiday property's value, as future potential buyers will be most attracted to places that are easy and cheap to get to.
