Accused Bourke St driver Dimitrious Gargasoulas tells court 'I am the saviour'

Posted

The man accused of killing six people and injuring dozens of pedestrians during a driving rampage through Melbourne's CBD has told a court he is "the saviour".

For the first time since he allegedly drove his car through the Bourke Street mall in January, Dimitrious Gargasoulas appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court via video-link on unrelated charges.

The 26-year-old's lawyer had previously told the court that he had been too ill to attend.

Dressed in a black jumper and white t-shirt, Gargasoulas smiled during the brief hearing and interjected on several occasions.

He said, "Your Honour, I wanted to tell you something", and later spoke about the Bible and the Koran, yelling, "Aboriginal law is identical to Muslim law".

His lawyer spoke over the top of him, warning him that members of the media were in court.

Gargasoulas then said: "All the law is illegal."

Later, he said: "Your Honour, did you know the Muslim faith is the correct faith according to the whole world? And I am not guilty."

Before his video-link was switched off, he called out: "I am the saviour."

Gargasoulas faces charges for theft and other offences allegedly committed in early January and late last year, including driving on the wrong side of the road to evade police in St Kilda.

The matter has been adjourned until May.

Gargasoulas is also due to reappear in court in December, for a separate hearing in relation to six charges of murder, 28 of attempted murder and conduct endangering life following the Bourke Street tragedy in January.
