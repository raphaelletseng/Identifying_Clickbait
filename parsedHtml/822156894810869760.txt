Man Hangs Himself With Girlfriend's Dupatta, She Says It Was A Joke Gone Wrong
Man Hangs Himself With Girlfriend's Dupatta, She Says It Was A Joke Gone Wrong A 21-year-old management student, who had been "joking with his girlfriend about ending his life", hanged to death at his Mira Road flat on Tuesday. His 17-year-old girlfriend, who was with him at that time, has claimed that Sanmit Rane was in a jocular mood and was pretending to hang when things went wrong, leading to his death. The two lived in the same colony and their families were aware of their relationship. In her statement to the police, Rane's girlfriend has said that it all started with Rane's telling her that he would end his life if she ever deserted him. It adds that Rane walked into the bedroom, grabbed a stool and made a noose out of a dupatta and left it dangling from the ceiling fan, said inspector Vilas Sanap of Kashimira police station. The girl's statement mentions that no sooner had Rane put the noose around his neck than he lost his balance. "The wooden stool on which he had been standing fell off, leaving him hanging by the dupatta," the girl has told the police. The girl, in a state of panic, summoned a family friend who rushed to Rane's house with a friend and the two men brought Rane down, snipped off the dupatta with a kitchen knife and took him to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead. Rane's parents have alleged foul play. His father has ruled out the possibility of his son having committed suicide, said the police. An accidental death report has been filed and the autopsy report is awaited.
