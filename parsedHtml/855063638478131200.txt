Florida Gators mascot made a spectacular play to save an unsuspecting young fan


On Tuesday, the Florida Gators baseball team was playing North Florida when a foul ball was heading towards the second row and an unsuspecting young fan.Â

Enter Albert E. Gator, the Gators mascot, who just happened to be seated next to the fan, and immediately went to protect the young lad from the incoming projectile. Albert took the ball directly off the noggin and the young fan repaid the favor by performing faux CPR on the mascot.

Mascots are the best.
