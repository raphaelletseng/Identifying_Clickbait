Doctors are planning to operate on her lesions as early as next week

(CNN) A 10-year-old girl in Bangladesh is being treated for the extremely rare condition known as "tree man" syndrome.

Sahana Khatun was admitted to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital on Sunday with unusual marks and growths on her face.

"She has bark-like warts growing on her chin, nose and ear," Dr. Samanta Lal Sen, chief plastic surgeon at the hospital, told CNN.

Sahana Khatun, 10, came to the hospital with bark-like warts growing on her face.

Sahana first developed the disease eight years ago, when her father found some rashes on her face. Only since last year have the tree-like warts begun sprouting on her face.
