People reveal the lamest excuses for cancelling a dateÂ 


Picture the scene: you've arranged a date with someone, but later decide they're not the right person for you.

So you rack your brains to come up with an inoffensive and plausible excuse to cancel on them, hoping they will buy it - and finally leave you in peace.

But it's all too easy to let your imagination run away with you.

Singletons have been sharing the lamest excuses they or the person they were supposed to date have used on Reddit - and some sound very hard to swallow.

People have been sharing the lamest excuses they or the person they were supposed to date have used on the discussion site Reddit - and some are very imaginative indeed

This excuse may be completely made up but the woman behind it wins points for originality

Sometimes even the wackiest of excuses turn out to be true - like this possum-related incident which transpired to be 'legit'. Luckily the pair saw the funny side and ended up dating

Some people's excuses were so lame as to be insulting - like the man who said he needed to 'feed his lizard' or the person who said they had to 'buy her sister shampoo'

If you do give someone a made-up excuse at least have the decency to cover your tracks on social media

This is a rather lame excuse from a fully-grown man, whether it's true or not...

Some excuses were just downright bizarre, like this woman who insisted she had been inexplicably saved from a random lightning strike in Germany - by her mystery boyfriend

Not much thought went into this excuse, it would appear

A few people had their cover blown after posting photos of their alternative plans on social media, like the woman who told her date she was going to church and then went shopping

At least this man was honest, although it is unknown whether his date knew he was married

It's easy to get away with this excuse if you work as a funeral director, but if you haven't mentioned your profession it's likely to cause some confusion

Sometimes excuses can backfire, as this woman learned the hard way after pretending her mother was 'really sick' and then forgetting about her elaborate lie just a few months later
