I'm disappointed in the administration in the biggest way. #SCPgoodgirl  pic.twitter.com/ya9lMtvCtX Calling us women "good girls" is demeaning and should not be tolerated in a school environment. Or anywhere for that matter. #scpgoodgirl Clearly, no one has learned from the United Airlines situation , or the fact that it's 2017. No one has a right to tell a woman what kind of attire is and isn't acceptable. Period.

Stanton College Preparatory School in Jacksonville, Florida is currently facing criticism over a flier posted in the school's hallways which dictates which type of dress is acceptable at their upcoming prom.

The flier includes a photo of four different dress cuts, accompanied by the caption, "Going to Stanton Prom?" over the top. If you thought telling women what to wear wasn't problematic enough, the images of clothing with a low back, high slit, or anything low cut informs them that they won't be going to the school's big dance while the one "adequate" dress has the equivalent of a disrespectful pat on the head with the caption: "Good girl."
