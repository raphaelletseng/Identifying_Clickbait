Kate McKinnon Returns to Troll Jeff Sessions as Forrest Gump in 'SNL' Cold Open
opened with a parody of the 1994 film with Kate McKinnon’s impersonation of attorney general Jeff Sessions as Tom Hank’s character. In the cold open, Sessions addressed the recent news of him recusing himself from investigations into his meetings with a Russian ambassador during the 2016 election. He admits that he spoke with Sergey Kislyak, and then kind of blurts out others who might have spoken with Russians at one point and time: Michael Flynn, J.D. Gordon, Jared Kushner, Carter Page, and Paul Manafort. Basically, Sessions reveals every one of Trump’s top advisors, quickly returning to eating his box of chocolates like nothing happened. Later, Beck Bennett’s Vladimir Putin makes an appearance, showing a sign of unsettling unity when Putin and Session fist-bump. You can watch it above.
