After raising his fist in the air with a slew of politically charged releases including hisÂ Us or Else: Letter to the SystemÂ album, T.I. heads back toÂ the trap with a new banger titled "Do My Thing" featuring DJ Whoo Kid and DJ MLK.

"We were tired of waiting on getting new music from Tip, so we basically forced his hand into releasing some street sh--,"Â saidÂ WhooÂ Kid and MLK in a joint statement sent to Billboard.Â "You know Tip tried holding onto this ['Do My Thing'], but then he was like f--- it, let's get it out."

The Jazzfeezy and Steve Samson-producedÂ track finds the Atlanta rapper mean-mugging all over the hard-hitting beat, spitting,Â "I'mma do my thing, give a damn what a n---a say."

Tip will continue to do his thing on his forthcomingÂ Hustle Gang tour, a 36-city trek that willÂ kickÂ off next month.Â
