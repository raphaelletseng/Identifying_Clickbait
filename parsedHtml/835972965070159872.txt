Outspoken President Donald Trump supporter, "The Celebrity Apprentice 2" star, and CEO of West Coast Choppers Jesse James is offering Second Amendment fans with plenty of cash to spend a $85,000 gun made with a piece of the Statue of Liberty.

The freedom-loving firearm is one of the latest from master fabricator James's Austin, Texas-based Jesse James Firearms Unlimited, which he launched in 2013.

The "Lady Liberty" Full Damascus Cisco 1911's steep price tag is due to the fact that it takes a year to make and some 500 hours of labor.

For your money, James notes, you get a firearm that contains "the DNA of America's biggest symbol of freedom," which, he adds, makes it "an Amazing piece of American History."

If you want one, though, you better act quick. He's only made three, and he's sold two already.

Over email, I asked James how the unique project came to be.

How and when did you acquire the original handrail pieces from the Statue of Liberty?

A person that will remain anonymous was involved in the restoration [of the Statue of Liberty]. He happened upon a piece of original handrail from around the torch. It was just laying there, so he grabbed it, and it ended up in my hands.

Why did you decide to put "the DNA of America's biggest symbol of freedom" into a firearm?

Once I got the original handrail, it was a pretty easy decision/concept.

You've made one and are making only two more of these. Has anyone bought one yet?

Two of the three are sold.

How much does the "Lady Liberty" 1911 cost?

$85,000. I know that seems like a lot, but it takes a full year to make and about 500 hours labor.

You appeared on Season 8 of "The Apprentice," and you're an outspoken Trump supporter. How do you see the Trump administration impacting the firearms business?

Everything is going great!
