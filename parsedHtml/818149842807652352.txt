Russell Westbrook and Cameron Payne Finally Brought Back Their Pregame Dance Routines
Cameron Payne has returned to the Oklahoma City Thunder after fracturing a bone in his foot right before the beginning of the season. His return means that Oklahoma City will now have the added benefit of his leadership and scoring off the bench.

Cameron Payne has returned to the Oklahoma City Thunder after fracturing a bone in his foot right before the beginning of the season. His return means that Oklahoma City will now have the added benefit of his leadership and scoring off the bench. But more importantly: The Cameron Payne/Russell Westbrook pregame dance routines are back!

Before last night’s contest against the Denver Nuggets, both guards were back to their old dance sessions before tip-off. After the game, Payne said, “It was cool. Like I said last year, it’s just to get you to relax and get ready for the game. It helped for sure.”

The Westbrook Revenge Tour had been missing something without these moments of tremendous dancing before every insane performance by OKC’s MVP. No two games are the same, and the dances follow in that vein as the two improvise their moves.

The dancing obviously helps because the consistently amazing Brodie had an amazing night from behind the arc. He hit seven long range bombs en route to yet another triple-double, his 17th on the season. A final stat line of 32 points, 17 rebounds, and 11 assists looks like something out of NBA 2k17 rather than a real game. But then again, Westbrook has been making the extraordinary look routine for much of this season.

Westbrook is the NBA’s scoring leader, even though it seems like every night someone is getting 40 points this season. Now with Payne back in the fold, we will see amazing dance moves along with these dazzling performances.
