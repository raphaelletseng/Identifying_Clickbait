Here is the project's ten best looks -- from signatures to impromptu costume designs and haute couture get ups. Kicking her lover "to the left, to the left" of the curb, Beyoncé promoted her ready-to-wear fashion line in the video for "Irreplaceable" (as well as many others). In this scene, she sports a black hoodie embellished by metallic colored logos of the brand and a corset top to match. Meant to be a reversible item, the opposite side of the hoodie is lined with faux brown fur. Today, the piece is sold as a rare artifact on third-party retailers for about $100-$150. With leopard print eye shadow and nails, the singer dons a matching, skintight bodysuit as she takes on the persona of a cat. The costume is accesorized by a black belt and heels, and leopard infused earrings. Latex clothing boutique recalls how Bey's mother, Tina, requested "over 40 items for ['Greenlight's' music] video". The company delivered the order with in a week's time, including this dominatrix inspired choice. The black and red latex corset attached to thigh high latex boots gave the songstress the rock star attitude she needed to keep things moving forward. Another fashion item that caught the eyes of viewers were the high heel ballet pointer shoes the singer tiptoes in. As the flashiest of all of 's videos, "Upgrade U" features a plethora of high end lyricism and images. In the backseat of a white the diva stuns with a braided ponytail and a white pant suit -- the blazer giving off a luxurious feel thanks to its white fur lining. To complete the swag of the look, the singer wore a pair of tinted Cazal 907 sunglasses. Tina Knowles might have called House of Harlot for the costumes in "Greenlight," but she turned into the designer for "Get Me Bodied." The singer's mother designed about 80 dresses for the stars of the video. Beyoncé's result: a silver sequined halter dress, perfect for the video's Bob Fosse-inspired dance number. In the video that the MTV Video Music Awards descibed as the "Most Earthshattering Collaboration," Beyoncé dances alongside her look-alike idol Shakira in similar black outfits. In this particular shot from the video, the singer dazzles in a long-sleeved, cut-out chiffon silk gown. The visual for "Déjà Vu" featured Bey's most haute-couture outfits in the ranging from a beaded white top to a green hula skirt. One of the more avant of the fare is a brown autumn leaves looking gown with a slit that reveals black and tan-sheer striped stockings. Beyoncé gave vibes under the New Orleans sun as she twirled in a red, patterned Maxi dress. To complete the outfit with more of a Southern Belle feel, the singer wears a pair of black, elbow length gloves. Channeling her inner a la the singer's peak fashion moments (and some of the most iconic of her career) exists in the visual for "Ring The Alarm." Case in point, the beige trench coat worn during her interrogation scenes. Finished off with black leather boots and a long ponytail, the look has been one of Beyoncé's favorites as she's performed in the outfit multiple times -- with various twists , but the same militaristic dance routine -- since the video's release. Since the days of " Survivor ," we've all seen the singer's affinity for camo-print when she needs to take control. With a camoflauge hooded zip up, Beyoncé makes solitary confinement look chic. She even pays homage to her days of wearing  ; although the fur lined booties she's wearing aren't exactly from the designer, they do take a page or two from the original designs.
