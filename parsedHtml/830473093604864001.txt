A neurologist captured these bizarre and creepy images to study the physics of human expression


In 1862, French neurologist Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne de Boulogne published The Mechanism of Human Facial Expression, a scientific and aesthetic text on the ways in which the muscles of the face create various expressions — a dictionary, so to speak, of what he believed was a universal, God-given language.

Duchenne had previously developed a number of therapeutic techniques involving the use of localized electric shocks to stimulate muscles.

While conducting experiments for his text, he partnered with Adrien Tournachon, brother of the famed photographer Nadar, to document the expressions he induced in his models with targeted, painless shocks.

He charitably described his primary model as “an old toothless man, with a thin face, whose features, without being absolutely ugly, approached ordinary triviality."

Together, the physician and photographer documented a range of triggered expressions, from the sly and subtle to the horrific and grotesque. Many of the photos included stagecraft, such as a nun in prayer and “Lady Macbeth” contemplating unknown cruelties.

In addition to its scientific value, Duchenne hoped the work would serve as a reference to help artists reproduce emotions and expressions more faithfully.

Duchenne’s study of facial expression would prove groundbreaking. Among other achievements, he is credited with discovering the physiological distinction between a forced, “mouth-only” smile, and a sincere smile — also known as a Duchenne smile.
