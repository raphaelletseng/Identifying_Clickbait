Truck blown over by powerful gust of wind in US

Posted

Dramatic video has captured the moment strong winds caused a truck driving down a US highway to topple over onto a patrol car.

Dashcam footage from the front of a Wyoming Highway Patrol car showed the moment a truck driving down Interstate 80 in southern Wyoming on Tuesday was hit by a strong gust of wind.

The force of the gust toppled the trailer over, in turn dragging the rig and container onto another patrol car parked directly opposite the car filming.

No one was in the car at the time.

The truck narrowly missed the car filming as it skidded along the road.

Gusts of up to 150km/h were recorded in the area around the time of the accident.

Patrol Lt David Wagener said the truck driver and a passenger were not hurt.

He said the highway was closed to lightweight, high-profile vehicles at the time because of the wind, adding that the driver of the truck was issued a citation.
