He may not be a household name yet, but he did win a Golden Globe for the role, which should have been a tip-off that Hollywood embraced him.

Not everyone would consider Mel Gibson a surprise directing nominee — he has a win for 1995's "Braveheart" and his latest, "Hacksaw Ridge," is violent but compelling — but Hollywood can have a long memory for shenanigans and bad behavior, and he's been the instigator of both . There are always going to be tears around the directing nominees anyway; once the best picture category was expanded to include up to 10 films in 2009, at least four directors whose pictures were considered top-notch would go without nominations themselves. This year, that meant Denzel Washington, who starred in and directed "Fences" only landed an acting (and best picture) nomination; directors of "Hidden Figures" (Theodore Melfi), Garth Davis ("Lion") and "Hell or High Water" (David Mackenzie) were not tapped even though their pictures were. Less of a surprise: No women were nominated for best director yet again, which makes seven years since one was included. (Only four have ever been nominated, with just one win: Katherine Bigelow in 2010 for "The Hurt Locker.") We're also sad that the hilarious "Deadpool" — which, admittedly, was considered a long shot — failed to score even one nomination.   Still, one of the most delightful surprises is that just one year after #OscarsSoWhite brought attention to the monochrome nature of most categories, diversity is on the rise — with each acting category featuring at least one actor of color.

For one thing, can you really have an Oscars without Tom Hanks? The two-time winner could have been nominated yet again for his role as Chesley Sullenberger in "Sully," the captain who landed a passenger plane on the Hudson ... but, nope. The film only has a single nomination, for sound editing.

Paramount, Warner Bros. Amy Adams and Tom Hanks flew high in "Arrival" and "Sully," but did not land Oscar love.

Not everyone would consider Mel Gibson a surprise directing nominee — he has a win for 1995's "Braveheart" and his latest, "Hacksaw Ridge," is violent but compelling — but Hollywood can have a long memory for shenanigans and bad behavior, and he's been the instigator of both.

Three African-American actresses (Viola Davis, "Fences"; Naomie Harris, "Moonlight"; Octavia Spencer, "Hidden Figures") dominated the supporting actress category, while supporting actor featured two men of color: Dev Patel ("Lion") and Mahershala Ali ("Moonlight"). (That said, we loved Janelle Monae in both "Hidden" and "Moonlight," and Taraji P. Henson was stellar as "Hidden's" key figure.)

Twentieth Century Fox Octavia Spencer (r.) landed the sole acting nomination for "Hidden Figures," but her co-stars Janelle Monae (l.) and Taraji P. Henson were equally as deserving.

And then there's "La La Land," which tied 1950's "All About Eve" and 1997's "Titanic" with 14 nominations. It already set a record for Golden Globe wins with 7 earlier this month, and is a heavily-tipped favorite for many Oscars.

Lionsgate Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have a great chance to twirl away with awards for "La La Land."
