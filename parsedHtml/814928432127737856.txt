George Michael: Initial autopsy finds singer's cause of death 'inconclusive'

Posted

British singer George Michael's cause of death is unclear after an initial autopsy and more tests will be needed, police have said.

Michael, who became one of the pop idols of the 1980s with Wham! before forging a successful solo career, died at his home in southern England on Christmas Day at the age of 53.

"A post mortem examination was carried out yesterday as part of the investigation into the death of George Michael," Thames Valley police said.

"The cause of death is inconclusive and further tests will now be carried out. The results of these tests are unlikely to be known for several weeks."

British police said Michael's death was "unexplained but not suspicious".

Michael's manager, Michael Lippman, had said he died of apparent heart failure.

Michael's Australian-born boyfriend Fadi Fawaz had tweeted of his grief, indicating he found the artist "dead peacefully in bed first thing" Christmas morning.

Meanwhile, fellow British singer Elton John teared up while paying tribute to Michael during a concert in Las Vegas.

With a picture of Michael lighting up the backdrop of the stage, he performed Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.

John called Michael's death one of the "saddest moments" of his career.

He said he knew Michael from the start of Wham! and the two collaborated on music.

John also tweeted a photo of the two, writing: "I am in deep shock. I have lost a beloved friend â€” the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist."

He said Michael donated to causes without fanfare.

In the mid-1980s, Wham! were one of the most successful pop duos with singles such as Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, Careless Whisper, Last Christmas and The Edge of Heaven.
