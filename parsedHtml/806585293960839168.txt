A truck driver stopped a police car chase when he blocked the suspect's car preventing his escape.

Police had attempted to pull over a car in California's San Fernando valley late on Tuesday night, when the suspected drink driver fled.

"He pulled out from this way and boom," Narek Nadzharyan explained. "So I just decided to reverse back and then I saw that he was kind of stuck so I decided to just trap him".
