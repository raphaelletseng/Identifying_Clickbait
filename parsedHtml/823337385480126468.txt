Floyd Mayweather Can Thank the Falcons for Winning $25,000 in a Bet
The rich keep getting richer. Prior to Sunday's NFC Championship Game between the Atlanta Falcons and Green Bay Packers , Floyd Mayweather placed a $30,000 bet on the first half spread, and came away with an additional $25,000 when the Falcons took a 24-0 lead over the Packers at halftime. Just made $25,000 in 30 minutes. The retired life.

On Friday, Money Mayweather made $45,000 when he took the Golden State Warriors as 5.5-point favorites over the Houston Rockets . The Warriors cruised their way to the 125-108 victory. On Friday, 1/20/17, I made $45,000 in 48 minutes.

It was incredibly close, but the Bearcats rolled the Green Wave to tune of a 78-61 win. How much did Mayweather make from that bet? Just $90,000. On Saturday, 1/21/17, I made $90,000 in 40 minutes.

How does that make you feel ? sportstips@complex.com
