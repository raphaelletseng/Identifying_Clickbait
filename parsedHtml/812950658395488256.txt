The network said Saturday it was dropping "Escaping the KKK: A Documentary Series Exposing Hate in America" a day after discovering that "nominal" cash payments were given by third-party producers. "While we stand behind the intent of the series and the seriousness of the content, these payments are a direct violation of A&E's policies and practices for a documentary," the network said in statement.
