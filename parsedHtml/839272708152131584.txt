Story highlights Singer, 53, was suffering from heart and liver conditions says coroner

He was found dead at his Oxfordshire home on Christmas Day

(CNN) Singer George Michael died of natural causes, it was announced Monday.

A coroner said the star, found dead at his home in Oxfordshire on Christmas Day, had a heart condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis.

The 53-year-old also suffered from a fatty liver, according to Oxfordshire's senior coroner Darren Salter.

"Inquiries into the death of George Michael have been concluded and the final post mortem report received," the coroner said, in a statement reported by Britain's Press Association.

"As there is a confirmed natural cause of death, being dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver, the investigation is being discontinued and there is no need for an inquest or any further inquiries."
