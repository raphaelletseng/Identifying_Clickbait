Blalock is reportedly seeking $500,000 in damages.

Wilson was fired in January 2014 after the network accused him of plagiarism; according to the $5 million lawsuit, the real reason for his termination was discrimination, and Wilson further claimed he was unable to find a job at another network after CNN allegedly published false and defamatory statements about him.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, CNN initially brought an anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) motion against Wilson and successfully halted the suit.
