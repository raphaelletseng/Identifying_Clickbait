Together with our partners at SSRS survey research firm, we asked Americans which U.S. president has given the best inaugural speech. The top choice among respondents was outgoing President Barack Obama, followed by presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Asked if they plan to tune in to watch Trump's inaugural address on Friday, Jan. 20, forty-one percent of Americans said no, 38 percent said yes and 21 percent said they are unsure if they will watch. Americans are also divided on how they feel about Trump's taking office. Asked what one word best describes how they feel about the upcoming inauguration, respondents said "excited," "hopeful," "scared" and "sad."
