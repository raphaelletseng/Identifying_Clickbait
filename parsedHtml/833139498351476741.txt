Police: Tucson mayor carjacked, uninjured
Shares                Tucson police say Mayor Jonathan Rothschild wasn't injured when he was carjacked at gunpoint. Police Sgt. Pete Dugan says a male suspect pointed a handgun at Rothschild and demanded his car keys as Rothschild walked to his car Saturday. Dugan says the same suspect was involved in several other incidents in the same midtown area before the carjacking, so detectives don't think the mayor was targeted because of his city office. Dugan says the other incidents included an unsuccessful carjacking attempt and some sort of altercation with a mail carrier. Dugan says the suspect and the car haven't been located. No detailed suspect description is available, including whether suspect is an adult. The incident happened in the area of Tucson Boulevard and Fifth Street.
