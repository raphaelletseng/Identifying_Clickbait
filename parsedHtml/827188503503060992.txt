Arnold Schwarzenegger fires back at Trump jab: How about 'I take over your job'?
Arnold Schwarzenegger fires back at Trump jab: How about 'I take over your job'?


Following president Donald Trump's remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, in which he took a swipe atÂ Arnold Schwarzenegger for his ratings as the new host of "Celebrity Apprentice" (which Trump previously hosted), the action idol has rapidly taken to Twitter in a video to respond.

In his remarks, TrumpÂ said he wantedÂ "toÂ just pray for Arnold" to have better ratings.

"Hey Donald, I have a great idea,"Â Schwarzenegger said in the video. "Why don't we switch jobs? You take over TV, because you're such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job. Then people can finally sleep comfortably again."

This is not the first time Trump and Schwarzenegger have traded jabs at one another about "Celebrity Apprentice."

After ratings numbers came out showing that the first episode of the Schwarzenegger-hosted "Apprentice" proved to be lower than Trump's last season on the show, Trump tweeted:

Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got "swamped" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for.... â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017

being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich & Hillary â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017

Schwarzenegger responded in a more diplomatic approach in that instance, giving some words of advice to the then-president-elect Trump by tweeting a video of himself quoting Abraham Lincoln:

Please study this quote from Lincoln's inaugural, @realDonaldTrump. It inspired me every day I was Governor, and I hope it inspires you. pic.twitter.com/QRoOFTZfQ9 â Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) January 6, 2017

Looks like Arnold isn't playing nice anymore.
