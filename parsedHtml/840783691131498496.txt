Elon Musk, Malcolm Turnbull in talks on renewables after billionaire's '100 days or it's free' pledge

Updated

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says he has held a "great in depth discussion" with Elon Musk, after the billionaire tech entrepreneur offered to fix South Australia's energy problems within 100 days.

On Friday, Mr Musk said energy storage could solve the state's electricity problems with a Tesla battery farm, and work could be completed within 100 days, or it would be free.

He followed that up in talks with South Australia's Premier Jay Weatherill, later tweeting that he was impressed by the State Government's commitment to a "smart, quick solution".

Twitter was again the preferred medium of communication on Sunday, with Mr Musk and Mr Turnbull swapping appreciative tweets after their own discussions

While it is not clear what an array in South Australia would cost, Tesla did deliver on a battery farm in Southern California, built using an array of 400 Powerpack 2 batteries.

South Australia suffered a statewide blackout last September, while during a recent heatwave customers were intentionally blacked out because there was not enough power to meet demand.

Mr Turnbull's office has been approached for comment.

More to come.
