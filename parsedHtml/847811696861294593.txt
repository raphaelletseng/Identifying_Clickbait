Donald Trumpâs historic presidency will look unlike any other thatâs come before it. From his outsider status in Washington to his familyâs continued residence in New York to his complicated business empire, each episode of this podcast will focus on one aspect of Trumpâs time in the White House that defies conventions and ask the question, âCan he do that?â

Hosted by Allison Michaels and co-hosted each week by a different Post reporter, âCan He Do That?â features original reporting that will illuminate the ways Donald Trump can reshape the presidency and explain what that means for people in the United States and the rest of the world.
