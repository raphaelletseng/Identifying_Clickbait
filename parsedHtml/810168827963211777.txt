Amsterdam-based fashion photographer Mirka Laura Severa usually shoots for the likes of Louis Vuitton and Lacoste, but for her latest project, commissioned by Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, she showcased winter fashion on snowmen. “Usually it’s beautiful models wearing beautiful clothes looking beautiful. I enjoy those images, but sometimes over-beautified can be boring,” she says. “Why don’t we make it different?” For the shoot she travelled to the Hintertux glacier, Austria, where weather conditions were so challenging her hands froze to the camera: “We were at 3,250 metres for the last shoot, when suddenly everything became completely white. It was so cold that ice crystals covered our bodies.”
