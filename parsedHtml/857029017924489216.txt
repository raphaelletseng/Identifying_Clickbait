Why Japanese Children Have Been Identified As The Healthiest And Happiest In The World Most of us would love for our children to be healthy and happy, but sometimes fail to understand the more elementary meaning of what nourishment means. A study published in throws light on light on of the most quintessential facets of nourishment for children: nutrition. A major worldwide health study published by them revealed that children born in Japan are projected to live a long and healthy life.    Here’s what you can take away from their eating habits: Eat more food, but fewer calories The idea is to combine foods that are lower in caloric density. For instance, typical Japanese meals include rice, a modest portion of meat or fish, and a couple of vegetable dishes. The idea is not to start preparing their cuisine but to include higher quantities of whole foods, and more fruits and vegetables, and cut down processed foods that have more ‘calories per bite’.    Use smaller sized plates and portions The Japanese curtail not just their food servings, but also the size of their plates. Use the side plates that you use to eat salads, and bread with to have your main meals, which are about four-to-six inches in diameter. Avoid demonising snacks Teach your children to enjoy the treats and snacks, but in the right frequency and amount; like the Japanese who eat in smaller quantities and lesser frequencies. They exercise what is known as ‘flexible restraint’ when it comes to consuming unhealthy food.    Dine together to inculcate healthy eating habits Show your child that you can enjoy eating healthy home-cooked food because it was made with and tastes wonderful. Set a particular time to sit down to eat once a day, even if you’re busy to reinforce this habit. Make rice your staple go-to carbohydrate Rice is the staple choice of food in Japanese cuisine, compared to less filling choices like dry bread. That’s because white rice is often mixed with foods like fish, veggies, and seaweed, which eliminates the ‘high-glycaemic’ spikes that white rice is associated with and leaves you feeling fuller.
