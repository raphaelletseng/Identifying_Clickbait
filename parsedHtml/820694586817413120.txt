Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's youngest son from his second marriage to Sadhna Gupta has taken the swag road, showing off a Lamborghini Huracan worth Rs. 5 crore on Instagram. The Italian beast can do 0-100 km/h in 3.2 seconds, and its 5200 cc 10-cylinder engine can certainly get the kid far away from the father-son feud that is making headlines.

The lad also has his hashtag-game on point - apart from a few defining the car, he threw in #instadaily #instagood #fitfam, and our favourite, #mirin (short for admiring)

Here him rev the supercar for that sweet sweet roar
