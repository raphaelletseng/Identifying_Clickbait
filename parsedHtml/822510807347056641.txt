Following former VP Joe Biden and his wife Jill's departure, our former FLOTUS Michelle accompanied Barak to the military helicopter that would carry them out of the capital.

Barack held Michelle's hand the entire time, even kissing it at one point — swoon — as they walked towards the chopper, said their final goodbyes to the Trump family, and waved goodbye to the American people.
