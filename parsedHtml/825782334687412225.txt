However the experience scaling one of the country's most famous rivers in the state of Minas Gerais soon turned into a nightmare as the pilot lost control and veered into the water close to the sandy shore.

Miraculously all three passengers and the pilot survived the crash with minor injuries but the helicopter was destroyed.

Crash investigators believe the accident was caused from a tailwind that prevented the pilot from gaining altitude.

The vehicle was owned by the Wsfly tour company and in the video a motor alarm can be heard although it was ignored by the pilot, according to Aviation Safety Network.
