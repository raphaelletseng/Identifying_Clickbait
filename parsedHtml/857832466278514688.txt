AFP officer accessed journalist's call records in metadata breach

Updated

An investigator with the Australian Federal Police (AFP) sought and acquired the call records of a journalist without a warrant, Commissioner Andrew Colvin says.

The breach occurred earlier this year and an internal AFP review has been conducted, the Commissioner said.

The matter was referred to the Commonwealth Ombudsmen two days ago.

"What was accessed was the records of calls, not the content of those calls," he said.

"Just the fact of the existence of the calls in the first place.

"A result of this matter and as a result of us identifying this breach, we have been reviewing our internal practices and procedures to make sure they are as robust as possible."

The journalist whose metadata was at the centre of the breach has not been informed, Commissioner Colvin added.

"We haven't notified the journalist that we have breached and accessed that particular journalist's data without the warrant."

More to come.
