"At first we thought this may be blasphemous, but after talking, we decided it was a cute way to add a little Jesus into our son's playtime. And we figured that Jesus could live in the hearts of all these different types of people in which the 'costumes' are portraying." â€” meghan Get it on Amazon for $15 .                                   "In daycare my mom had to tie bright, colorful toys to my pigtails to get the other kids to play with me. In kindergarten the teacher bribed fellow students with chocolate milk. In elementary school the teachers put me in classes with a group of students that they thought were more like me. In junior high the teachers weren't sympathetic to the issue. In high school I had already learned to accept that no one liked me. Now as an adult I have become a friendless shut-in. I leave the house long enough to go to work where my coworkers ignore me. The neighbors hide behind their bushes when they see me. The kids run screaming. Well, that was, until now! Now that I have this Portable Pizza Pouch I can't get rid of my new friends. Every morning I get up and slip a pizza into the pouch and wrap it around my neck. Life couldn't be any easier. I finally have followers on all my social media accounts. I have been invited to join book clubs! I even have a BFF for the first time ever! The dog even wants to be my friend! Also, the pizza aroma covers up my natural body odor. Caution: Do not heat pizza pouch in oven or microwave. Do not wash in the dishwasher, either." â€” Silvr Craze  Get it on Amazon for $9 .                                   "It's a 4.25" golden cock.

Yes, the plastic rings that come with it aren't the prettiest. But none of that matters once it's up and hanging. This curtain will inspire you. Maybe you connect with the unicorn.
