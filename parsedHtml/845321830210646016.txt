The Cool Kids are back.Â After announcing their reunion last July, the rap duo of MySpace fame -- comprised ofÂ Mikey Rocks and Chuck InglishÂ -- unleash their playful visual for "TV Dinner."Â

"TV Dinner" is our first video back together in some time so we wanted to make sure we hit the big screen with a bang," Mikey Rocks tells Billboard.Â "We took it back to Chicago where it all started for TheÂ CoolÂ Kids, and shot something that would capture the energy and humor of the song."

The Jimmy Regular-directed video finds the pair assuming different characters on-screen from their sketch comedy show like on-air reporter Lance Bingemton and talk show host Mowry.Â "We even have cameosÂ from some of our favorite characters from our sketch comedy showÂ The Shit ShowÂ to tie things in even further. Things should get crazy from here," adds Rocks.
