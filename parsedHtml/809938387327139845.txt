These beautiful sea smoke images are one silver lining of the polar vortex
Mystical clouds of sea smoke arose over bodies of water across the East Coast, from Lake Michigan to the Atlantic, this week as the polar vortex took hold . Their dreamy look is the result of water and air temperatures intermingling, as cool air blows over comparatively warm water and then formulates the clouds of "smoke."
