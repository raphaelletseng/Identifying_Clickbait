NYC Just Opened A Cookie Dough Cafe And It's Exactly What We Need Right Now
In what is probably the best non-fake news you’ll read today: NYC has opened a COOKIE DOUGH CAFÉ. It’s called Dō — and it opened this week in Greenwich Village. The shop serves up raw, ready-to-eat dough that’s safe to eat on its own — because the dough is made with pasteurized eggs (i.e., no salmonella here!) and served slightly chilled.  The menu is basically a cookie lover’s fantasy come true. There are a total of 12 flavors to choose from, including chocolate chip, cake batter, sugar cookie, and brownie batter. There’s also a Nutella flavor called ~Heavenly~: It’s made with sugar cookie, Nutella, chocolate chips, and caramel bits, and it’s founder Kristen Tomlan’s favorite flavor. (It’s also kept in a separate fridge with all the other nut flavors, so if you don’t see it, ask for it!) Besides the raw dough, the cafe serves up other Instaworthy treats too, like this Nutella-filled cupcake: This is their “Cookie Bomb” and it’s made with raw cookie dough, cookie dough buttercream, and lots and lots of Nutella. Or these cookie dough sandwiches: You can even watch bakers as they create the dough: Or, you know, you can just eat it: Watch the full video here:            NYC Just Opened A Cookie Dough Cafe And It’s Exactly What We Need Right Now           SHARE YOUR VOTE!
