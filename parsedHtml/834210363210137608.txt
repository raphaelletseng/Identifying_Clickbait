Could this be the first major teen challenge of 2017? We hope so. A group of students at Georgia's Nocross High School turned an unfortunate situation into potential viral glory with the creation of their new, very dumb, very fun #NoBallChallenge. When their coach took away their basketballs, a group of students decided their fun could not be stopped and continued to play without one. And just like that, their perfect viral video was born.
