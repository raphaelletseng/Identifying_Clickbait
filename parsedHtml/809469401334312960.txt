Brock Lesnar has been suspended for one year and fined $250,000 for a pair of failed drug tests that were revealed after UFC 200.

ESPN's Brett Okamoto was the first to report the official punishment Thursday.

Lesnar returned to the Octagon for the first time in nearly five years at UFC 200 and scored a unanimous-decision victory over Mark Hunt to boost his career record to 6-3, but the win was changed to a no-contest Thursday, per Okamoto.

According to Shaun Al-Shatti of MMAFighting.com, the 39-year-old tested positive for the banned substance hydroxy-clomiphene, which resulted in a temporary suspension by the Nevada Athletic Commission.

Lesnar was still under contract with WWE at the time of the fight, and he has since competed in matches against Randy Orton at SummerSlam and against Bill Goldberg in November at Survivor Series.

The Beast Incarnate is one of two Superstars, along with Goldberg, who have been announced for participation in January's Royal Rumble match.

While Lesnar's UFC future is unclear, he will be eligible to compete in the summer of 2017 should he and the promotion reach an agreement.
