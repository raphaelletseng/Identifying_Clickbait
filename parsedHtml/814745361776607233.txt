This happened when a huge mass of energetic particles from the sun smashed into the magnetic field around the Earth, stirring up a stunning display of northern lights, which was captured by a NASA satellite.

On December 22, the Suomi NPP satellite acquired a gorgeous view of the Nothern Lights and we're crying because we weren't there to actually see it.

It stretched from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nunavut and Northwest Territories and the usual aurora oval.

But it wasn't just NASA. A lot of people captured it within the tiny frames of their cameras.

And some more

What a mighty sight it must have been!

Predominantly found in higher altitudes in the Arctic and Antarctic region, Aurora Borealis is one of the most beautiful sights Mother Nature has to offer. I mean, just look at these images.
