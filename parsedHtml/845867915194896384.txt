Unless youâ€™re Donald Trump, who appears to be most happy sitting at the wheel of a big truck.

Nothing makes a US president feel more alive and engaged than the act of making life better for millions of Americans.

Unless youâ€™re Donald Trump, who appears to be most happy sitting at the wheel of a big truck.

Mr Trump was meeting with truck drivers and trucking CEOs at the White House on Thursday to discuss health care.

This culminated in the President heading outside to check out an 18-wheeler.
