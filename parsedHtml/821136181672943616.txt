Story highlights Republican sources say Trump labor secretary pick Andrew Puzder may be having second thoughts

A confirmation hearing has not yet been set for Puzder

Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's choice to be labor secretary has voiced second thoughts in recent days, because of a relentless barrage of criticism from Democrats, labor unions and other liberal groups, a business ally and GOP sources tell CNN.

Andy Puzder is the CEO of the company that owns the Hardees and Carl's Jr. fast food chains.

A Trump transition spokesperson declined to comment, but later pointed to a tweet made by Puzder after CNN's report, which said: "I am looking forward to my hearing."
