Top womenâs tennis player 'lucky to be alive' after a home intruder posing as a gas man held a knife to her throat


Women's tennis star and two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova was stabbed in her left hand, her playing hand, with a knife by a home intruder on Tuesday, according to reports.

According to a report from David Ornstein of BBC, Kvitova, currently No. 11 in the world, was in theÂ Czech town of Prostejov when the burglar, posing as a gas man, was let into the house. Upon entering, he recognized Kvitova. Kvitov's spokesman, Karel Tejkal, had said that the crime was random and not targeted.

According to Ornstein, the burglar held a knife to Kvitova's throat when a struggle began in the bathroom. Kvitova reportedly suffered lacerations to four fingers on her left hand, when the burglar ran and the police were called.

Ornstein reports that Kvitova is undergoing "potentially career-saving" surgery.

Tejkal said Kvitova has been treated by a doctor and the injuries aren't considered life-threatening.

Kvitova tweeted on Wednesday:

In my attempt to defend myself, I was badly injured on my left hand. I am shaken, but fortunate to be alive. The injury is severe and I will â Petra Kvitova (@Petra_Kvitova) December 20, 2016

need to see specialists, but if you know anything about me I am strong and I will fight this. Thank you all again for your love and support â Petra Kvitova (@Petra_Kvitova) December 20, 2016

According to reports, the suspect is still at large and police have launched a manhunt.

According to ESPN, Kvitova was supposed to play in a charity match on Tuesday. It's unclear at this time how the injury will affect her play going forward.
