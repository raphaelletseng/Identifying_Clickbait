3 men have been arrested in Uppsala, Sweden as suspects in the gang rape of a 30-year-old woman. Police were reportedly tipped off at around 9 AM, after the night-time incident was live-streamed on Facebook on a private group.

Swedish daily tabloid Aftonbladet interviewed some of the members of the 60,000-strong group. They said the girl was "close to unconscious". A woman who saw the live stream thought it was "poorly-orchestrated joke".

"Two guys pushing down a girl on the bed... I first thought it was a poorly-orchestrated joke. But it was not," 22-year-old Lovis said.

She claims that 200 people were watching the video at one point, before the police showed up on the scene.
