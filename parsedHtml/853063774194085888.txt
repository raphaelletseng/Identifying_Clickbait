Penn Station Broke Out in Hysteria After A Suspect Was Tased
It’s been a crazy night at Penn Station. After a New Jersey Transit train was stuck in a tunnel for over an hour on Friday, the station broke out in hysteria after people believed shots were fired. Reports indicate the sound actually came from a Taser. MTA says two people are in custody for “disobeying orders.” One reporter says the tased suspect was “emotionally disturbed.” Amtrak PD placed 2 people into custody for disobeying orders at Penn Station. Taser was used on 1 during incident. NYSP on scene.
