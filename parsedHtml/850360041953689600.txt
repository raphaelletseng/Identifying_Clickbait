Sony Is Planning To Scrap The Kapil Sharma Show, Might Offer Sunil Grover His Own Show! 2017 is not Kapil Sharma's year and he too should make peace with this fact. His one mistake has taken a toll on his success and fame. If reports are to be believed, Sony TV is planning to cancel The Kapil Sharma show. A DNA report claims that Sony had paid a whopping ₹107 crore to Kapil Sharma but because of the whole fiasco, the channel is going through a rough patch and facing monetary losses. According to DNA, a source from Sony TV said, “They are terribly disappointed with how much bad press the entire Kapil Sharma episode has brought to the channel and the show. The ratings have dipped way more than what they thought it would and they are mostly not signing Kapil anymore. In fact, they might pull plugs on The Kapil Sharma Show once and for all.”  The tables have turned and how. SONY might just offer Sunil Grover his very own show! Yep, you read that right. A source was quoted in the report saying, “They are planning to invest in Sunil now for a different show altogether. Ever since the fight happened, even rival channel Colors (who have a long standing issue with Kapil) has approached Sunil for a show but he has not signed anything. Sony has rights to his characters – Rinku bhabhi and Dr. Mashur Gulati and also earn a chunk of money from his live shows where he performs in his avatars. And they are incredible characters in their own spaces already. So they might have a show with these characters.” If you still don't believe in the concept of Karma, it's high time you really do.
