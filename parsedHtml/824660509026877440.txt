Ikea just debuted a bizarre new collection inspired by 'todayâs nomadic youth' â take a look


Ikea has teamed up withÂ British fashion designer Kit Neale to create a new, bold collection targeted at a group the company describes asÂ "modern nomads living on their own terms."

Called SPRIDD, the collectionÂ features housewares, accessories, and apparel. The company says the aesthetic was influenced by '60s pop art, '90s fashion, and modern-day music festivals. The items will be available in US stores starting February 2017.

Ikea doesn't comeÂ right out and say the kitschy collection is geared toward Millennials or Gen Z, but that seems to be the implication.
