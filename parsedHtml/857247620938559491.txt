Trump's first 100 days in office have come and gone, and they're not getting great reviews . So, naturally, Pete Souza has some throwback photos to post. President Obama's official White House photographer, well-known for his timely bouts of Instagram shade , has been sharing shots from Obama's first 100 days — which seem a little, uh, busier. And, less situated in Florida. And, are those a bunch of photos of him interacting civilly with Republican leaders?

Chief Justice John Roberts administers the oath of office. Wait, you say. Wasn't the inauguration the day before? It was but the Chief Justice had made a slight error in the wording of the oath. So the White House counsel decided, for an abundance of caution, to ask Roberts to do it again at the White House the next day. Although it has sometimes incorrectly been reported that there was no press present for this, a small press pool (including Time photographer Callie Shell) did witness the second swearing-in in the Map Room. POTUS even joked to the pool afterwards, "The bad news for the pool is there’s 12 more balls.” A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on First 100 days.
