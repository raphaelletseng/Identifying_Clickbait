Local media reported that the image, which showed the woman holding the firearm and her partner cuddling her from behind, was posted on Ashley Coleman’s Instagram account. “IM HIS BONNIE HE MY CLYDE,” the caption reads. Authorities have not confirmed whether the couple shown in the image are Coleman, 27, and Hakeem Griffin-White, 17. The two have been charged with murder in the death of a 19-year-old in Dallas. Authorities said the victim, 19-year-old Drekeiston Alex, was walking through a parking lot on March 2 when Griffin-White approached him. The two started to argue and Alex walked into the street, according to an arrest warrant affidavit . Griffin-White followed him — then pulled a pistol and shot him, police said. Police said Alex fled from the area on foot and collapsed. A bystander called 911, and Alex was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.   A witness told police that Coleman later admitted to her that Griffin-White shot “that boy,” according to the court documents. Coleman was seen driving a Chrysler PT Cruiser near the scene of the shooting, according to authorities. After Alex was shot, Griffin-White jumped into the car, which sped off, police said. On Friday, the day after the shooting, officers located the PT Cruiser at a residence and observed it being driven away, followed by a U-Haul truck. When the officers stopped the truck, police said, the driver told them that a couple had asked him to help them move. Investigators staked out the residence and arrested Griffin-White and Coleman on Sunday, three days after the shooting. They have been charged with murder and are being held on $500,000 bond, according to online booking records. It was unclear whether Griffin-White has been assigned an attorney. Coleman’s attorney, Phillip Hayes, said his client has a documented history of mental-health issues and has been on unspecified medications over the years. Hayes said he did not know whether that will play into the murder charge. “I’ve talked to her and I think she feels the situation has been portrayed in a way to make her look guilty,” Hayes said of Coleman, adding that once the facts of the case come out, they may tell a different story.   During the investigation, authorities said, they found a video on Facebook in which Griffin-White and Coleman were seen holding a firearm and ammunition and talking about shooting someone, according to the arrest warrant affidavit . The video has since been deleted, according to the Dallas Morning News . Asked about the “Bonnie and Clyde” reference on Instagram, Dallas police told The Washington Post only that the investigation is ongoing. Asked the same question, Hayes said he had talked to his client about the Instagram post — but he would neither confirm nor deny that it was hers. The Morning News also referenced Facebook posts allegedly written by the suspects, in which they denied the accusations just days before their arrest. In one post from Friday, Griffin-White reportedly wrote , “Why Would I Kill Somebody While My Gurr Son Inna Car Df # Think.” In another, Coleman reportedly wrote , “Im Far From A Murderer. I Swear To God Its All An Image.” The posts were still on Facebook as of Thursday morning.
