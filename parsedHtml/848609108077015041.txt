These 9 states are where taxpayers get the most for their tax dollars


Most people don't enjoyÂ paying taxes, butÂ they are vital to financing important programs and projectsÂ from which US citizens benefit.Â

In a way, taxes are sort of like an investment. Taxpayers (investors) pay federal and state governments money with the expectation they'll get services such as paved roads and operating national parks (a return).

But a new report by WalletHub, the personal finance site, indicates that certain states receiveÂ a much higher return on their tax investment.Â

Using more thanÂ 23 metrics to look at five different categories, the report identified the states with the best taxpayer ROI for 2017.Â

According to the report, "Red States," or Republican states, get a much bigger bang for their buck when it comes toÂ their tax dollars with an average ranking of 21.07, compared with "Blue States," or Democratic states, which have an average ranking of 32.15.

Here are some other key findings:

"Nebraska has the lowestÂ proportion of major roads in poor condition, 5 percent, which is 8.8 times lower than in Connecticut, the state with the highest at 44 percent."

"Vermont has the lowestÂ number of violent crimes per 1,000 residents, 1.18, which is 6.2 times lower than in Alaska, the state with the highest at 7.30."

"New Hampshire has the lowestÂ infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births, 4.18, which is 2.2 times lower than in Mississippi, the state with the highest, 9.27."

Following are the top nineÂ states with the highest return on investment for their tax dollars.Â
