The moth's name also brings awareness to conservation challenges

(CNN) No doubt Donald Trump will be showered with honors at his inauguration, but none will be quite as unique as this little moth.

A biologist has named a newly discovered species of moth after our next president. The Neopalpa donaldtrumpi is a wee little creature found in parts of California and Baja, Mexico.

When he came across the species, evolutionary biologist Dr. Vazrick Nazari knew what he had to do.
