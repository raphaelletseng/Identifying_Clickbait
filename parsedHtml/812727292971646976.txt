The Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers tied with five. Most popular team in a state that doesn’t have a team? North Dakota and the Minnesota Vikings.

Most of these make sense; while a team is not in a state, it’s within reasonable proximity. It’s interesting that Hawaii, which is far south of the continental U.S. sees the San Francisco 49ners as the most popular.
