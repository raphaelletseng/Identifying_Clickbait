Giant 30ft wall of rubbish left as traveller slum is cleared in Paris


This is the giant 30ft mound of rubbish left behind after Roma travellers were on in the latest bid to end the rise of shanty towns in Paris.

Riot police launched an operation to clear the slum near Porte de la Chapelle in the north of the French capital.

Pictures show a huge wall of plastic sacks filled with rubbish at the site, along a section of the disused 'Petite Ceinture' circular railway line.

The bags were dumped next to ramshackle huts where a Roma community had set up camp in recent months.

The evacuation of 80 people comes days after fire crews were called to a fierce blaze at the make-shift camp, according to France 3.

Le Point reported that the encampment had developed into two parts, at the Porte des Poissonniers and the Porte de la Chapelle, with a series of small wooden huts close to one another on the disused railway track.

French cities such as Nice and Paris have large Roma communities living in makeshift camps, and frequent efforts are made to raze them.

Most of the inhabitants come from Romania or Bulgaria, and are European Union passport holders, but they are still regularly stigmatised because of their links with organised crime, including gangs of street thieves.
