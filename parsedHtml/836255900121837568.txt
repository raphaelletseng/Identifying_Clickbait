Half Of Twitter Makes The Same Joke About Russia And Oscar Night
When “ La La Land ” was mistakenly awarded Best Picture before “ Moonlight ” producers claimed their rightful prize at the 89th annual Academy Awards on Sunday, millions of viewers were left with questions such as, “What?” “How?” and “Why?” The Oscars snafu for the ages came just over two months after reports described Russia’s meddling in the November U.S. presidential election. Parallels between Hollywood’s biggest election and the country’s biggest election ― both ending with a twist ― didn’t escape people on Twitter. Plenty of them wished the 45th president had been announced a bit more like the switcheroo way “Moonlight” nabbed Best Picture. Meanwhile, others couldn’t help but joke about conspiracy theories between Russia’s highest officials and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm responsible for overseeing voting and handing out envelopes with winners’ names inside. Breaking: Putin has just hired PWC to audit and announce the winner of the next Russian national election. We're gonna investigate the Oscars harder than Trump's Russia connection. But what does Russia have to gain by messing with the #Oscars ? Did Russia hack the Oscars? #Oscars I'm blaming Russia and going to sleep. #Oscars "Russia hacked the Oscars." pic.twitter.com/pL2bnXs8lA Not this time, Russia.
