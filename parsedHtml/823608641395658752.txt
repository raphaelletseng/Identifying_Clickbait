At least 10 drown after boat carrying suspected Indonesian migrants capsizes near Malaysia

Posted

At least 10 people, believed to be Indonesian migrants, have died after their boat capsized off Malaysia's coast.

Two people were rescued and the bodies of 10 people were found washed ashore on a beach in Malaysia's southern Johor state.

An estimated 28 people are still missing.

A Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency official said villagers discovered the bodies early on Monday morning.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said a rickety wooden boat was found not far from the beach.

He said it may have been carrying about 40 people who were trying to enter Malaysia illegally.

The boat is thought to have overturned due to strong waves and bad weather conditions.

The official said a search for other victims was called off for the night but would resume on Tuesday.

It was the latest in a string of accidents in the waterways between Indonesia and Malaysia involving overloaded boats ferrying labourers seeking work in Malaysian factories and plantations.

In November, more than half of the 101 passengers aboard a boat died after it hit a reef and sank off the Indonesian island of Batam, south of Singapore.

Four months earlier, a boat sank en-route to Batam. Malaysian authorities recovered eight bodies and rescued 34 people.

Malaysian police recovered 17 bodies in January last year after a boat carrying illegal migrants capsized in high seas.
