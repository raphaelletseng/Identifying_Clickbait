A Beaver Somehow Ended Up Herding Cattle On A Saskatchewan Ranch
How do we move 150 heifers in Canada? Just need a better trained beaver... #Canadian #Canada150 #CDNbeef… https://t.co/Mr9S4F3zli This bizarre scene unfolded on a ranch in Saskatchewan on Friday. Adrienne Ivey and her husband Aaron told 980 CJME they were checking on their cattle last Friday when they saw it.                                  “We talk about how awesome our Canadian beef is, but a beaver leading cattle around? It’s the most Canadian thing ever!” Ivey said.                                  Ishmael Daro is a social news editor for BuzzFeed and is based in Toronto. Contact Ishmael N.
