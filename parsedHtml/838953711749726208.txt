26 Tweets Prove #WhatFeministsWear Is ‚ÄòAnything They F*cking Want'
Emma Watson and her under-boobs had the internet up in arms last week, with critics suggesting a real feminist would never pose in a revealing outfit. The actress and UN Women Goodwill Ambassador told Reuters that the backlash was a result of misunderstandings about feminism as a concept. ‚ÄúFeminism is not a stick with which to beat other women with.

A post shared by Vanity Fair (@vanityfair) on It was imperative that an expert weigh in on the controversy, so TMZ stopped Gloria Steinem at LaGuardia airport to ask if feminists can wear sexy outfits.¬†She stated simply:¬†‚ÄúFeminists can wear anything they fucking want.‚Äù Indeed, a person‚Äôs belief in gender equality is independent from her sartorial choices. Feminism is fundamentally about choice and the idea that the way a woman acts, talks and dresses should not determine whether she‚Äôs worthy of respect.
