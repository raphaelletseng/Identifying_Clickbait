As if the stakes weren't high enough already for Harry Styles' muchÂ anticipated debut solo single, "Sign of the Times," imagine what it looks like 100 feet in the air dangling from a helicopter.Â

It's with that vantage the One Direction heartthrob was shooting his music video for the song,Â as The Sun reports, hovering above remote farmland shoreline in Scotland earlier this week.Â

Last week Styles announced "Sign of the Times" would be released this Friday, sharing the single artwork on social media.Â
