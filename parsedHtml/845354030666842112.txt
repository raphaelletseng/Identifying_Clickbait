The Most Savage Memes Inspired by Kendrick Lamar's "The Heart Part 4"
When Kendrick Lamar drops a track like "The Heart Part 4," it's time for the culture to stand up and pay attention. For the most part, my Twitter timeline has been on one, primarily dissecting what looks like the latest shot in the saga that is K-Dot and Big Sean's relationship post-"Control," but because it is Twitter, cats are getting those savage tweets off. F*ck it, it is a Friday, why not have some fun? And what better way to treat oneself than to dive head first into the illest memes that were born from K-Dot's pen? Is this where those K-Dot/Sean convos started? yall think kendrick is talking about drake but he's really talking about big sean pic.twitter.com/vHbvqlrKMT For those of you wondering what Drakeâ€”who owned the conversation prior to "The Heart Part 4" droppingâ€”would be feeling, don't worry; there's a meme for that. "Kendrick be like 'Shut the fck up.' I be quiet.  But when he leave, I be rappin again." pic.twitter.com/mKjdn7yrsZ That feel when you aren't sure if Kendrick's dissing you or the other dude.
