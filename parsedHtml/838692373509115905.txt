Brexit could 'derail' EU attempts to fight climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, say MEPs
Brexit could “derail” the European Union’s attempts to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions , according to British MEPs. Britain’s decision to leave the trading bloc could have a detrimental impact on the European Carbon Trading Scheme (ETS), which is the flagship policy aimed at cutting carbon emissions across the continent. The United Kingdom is committed to providing almost €2bn (£1.7bn) worth of funding for the scheme, without which it is not yet clear how the system will survive.

Companies which fall under the remit of the scheme have to hand in an allowance for every tonne of carbon they release. They are allowed to buy and sell these allowances, which are priced to incentivise a reduction in emissions. Ian Duncan MEP, who is the Conservatives' European spokesman on energy and climate change and also the lead lawmaker on reforming the ETS, said there was a “serious risk” Brexit could stop the functioning of the scheme, leading to “disastrous” consequences. “In order for ETS to work a number of funds were created to help Eastern European nations to address the challenges of modernising their Soviet-era energy generators and manufacturing companies. “The UK is one of the major contributors to this fund and after it leaves the finance for this fund will not be there,” Mr Duncan told . “Without it, there is a serious risk not only that the ETS stops functioning post-Brexit, but that the EU loses support for its climate change targets altogether. With Donald Trump in the White House, the consequences of this could be disastrous for global efforts to tackle climate change.” As it stands 10 per cent of allowances that are to be auctioned are transferred to lower-income member states. The UK’s contribution to this is approximately 100 million allowances. Without the UK's input other EU member states would have to cover the costs or run the risk of lower income member states refusing to accept the climate change targets.

A Drax spokesperson said: “Our Government has taken a leadership role on carbon pricing at a European level and, as participation in the EU ETS is not dependent on EU membership, we hope that this situation continues as negotiations around Brexit move forward.” More about: European Union Brexit climate change carbon trading greenhouse gas emissions Comments
