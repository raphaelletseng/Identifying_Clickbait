Julian Assange tweeted for the first time, as if the world needs more tweets
Julian Assange tweeted  for the first time, as if the world needs more tweets
Julian Assange tweeted from his personal Twitter account for the first time on Tuesday. Perhaps he thought the world needed another highly partisan person tapping out 140-character blurbs to be favorited and scrolled past. Assange — publisher of WikiLeaks — to his credit, did not immediately begin typing out a barrage of pro-President Donald Trump screeds. His organization, WikiLeaks, spends a great deal of time shouting about how the world is unfair to the president of the United States. SEE ALSO: Chelsea Manning will go free. Now, about Julian Assange's extradition ... Instead, Assange tweeted to inform the world that any rumors of his death should be discounted. Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated (in a curious plot) https://t.co/S7Nd9SIXIw  pic.twitter.com/KpDzLbokxH — Julian Assange (@julianassange) February 14, 2017 He then retweeted a WikiLeaks tweet about his own tweet. Our publisher @JulianAssange has activated his personal account and made his first tweet today. See @JulianAssange — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) February 14, 2017 It's all very riveting. If Assange devotes his account only to dispelling rumors of his death, he will still have a reasonably active account. A quick Google search of "Assange death rumors" turns up a string of headlines. BONUS: Edward Snowden says Russians probably hacked the NSA
