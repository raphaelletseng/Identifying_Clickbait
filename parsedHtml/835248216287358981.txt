Warriors reportedly ask TNT to tell Shaquille O’Neal to lay off JaVale McGee

Shaquille O’Neal’s weekly “Shaqtin’ a Fool” segment on TNT may have to find a new target. On Friday, a day after JaVale McGee and O’Neal squared off on Twitter over a parody video of the Golden State center, the Wariors lobbied Turner Sports to curb its negative coverage of McGee, ESPN reports. O’Neal’s regular taunting of McGee on TNT’s popular “Inside the NBA” program is “doing unnecessary damage to McGee’s reputation,” the Warriors told Turner Sports, according to ESPN’s reports. The language of the request echoes the same sentiment shared by Coach Steve Kerr earlier on Friday. “You think about JaVale’s career. When you’re in this position, where somebody on national TV is making fun of you night after night after night, it’s not the greatest thing for your reputation,” Kerr said (via ESPN). “I can tell you I had a preconceived notion of JaVale before he got here that turned out to be totally false. And a lot of that was because of what goes on with Shaq’s ‘Shaqtin’ a Fool.'” Kerr added: “JaVale has been fantastic for us, as a player, a teammate, fantastic guy. He’s funny, he’s fun to be around, he does his job. He’s a total pro.”   Turner confirmed to ESPN, meanwhile, that “the matter has been discussed internally.” McGee has frequently been featured in O’Neal’s weekly segment, which highlights the league’s most boneheaded plays dating from the time in 2012 when the former Wizards center ran back on defense while his team still had the ball . On Thursday’s edition of “Inside the NBA,” O’Neal said he’d lay off McGee, who is averaging 6.1 points and three rebounds for the Warriors, “starting next week.” But first, he showcased some of McGee’s worst Shaqtin’-worthy gaffes through the years in a lengthy “Doctor Strange” parody.

Turner confirmed to ESPN, meanwhile, that “the matter has been discussed internally.”

McGee has frequently been featured in O’Neal’s weekly segment, which highlights the league’s most boneheaded plays dating from the time in 2012 when the former Wizards center ran back on defense while his team still had the ball.
