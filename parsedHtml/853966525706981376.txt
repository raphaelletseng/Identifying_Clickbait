Drake has publicly accused a country club in Coachella Valley of racial profiling, prompting a windfall of negative reviews on the establishment's Yelp page. According to Drake, the Madison Club in La Quinta, California engaged in racial profiling during his visit this weekend. "The most offensive place I have ever stayed at in my life," Drake captioned a photo of the Madison Club's logo on Instagram Sunday, "with staff who pick and choose who they are going to accommodate based on racial profiling."
