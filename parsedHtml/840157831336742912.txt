India's First AC Ambulance On Rails Will Rush To Action During Disasters! Central Railway (CR) unveiled India's first air-conditioned rail ambulance that will rush to the aid of injured passengers during the vital 'golden hour'. An accident victim's chances of survival are greatest if treatment is provided within an hour or less, known as the golden hour. The ambulance, which will be stationed at Kalyan, was made by modifying an AC coach used for passenger service. CR's chief public relations officer Narendra Patil said, "The four-coach rail ambulance of CR is the first fully airconditioned medical recovery van of the Indian railway." The ide a for such a facility came after 19 passengers died and around 145 got injured after the Diva-Sawantwadi train derailed between Nagothane and Roha stations in Maharashtra's Raigad district in May 2014. Former CR general manager S K Sood felt such an ambulance was necessary for quick response to emergency situations. A rail ambulance will also be able to ferry more people and travel faster compared to regular ambulances. When not used for accidents, the ambulance will be used for medical facilities in large congregations.
