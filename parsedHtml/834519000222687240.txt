In 2015 there was a point-blank ambush of a police officer carried out by Edward Archer, who said he was acting in the name of ISIS. The incident was caught on video. As Breitbart News reported, Sheriff Clark said the man “should be charged with treason … charged as an enemy combatant, held at Gitmo, and he should not have access to American courts.”
