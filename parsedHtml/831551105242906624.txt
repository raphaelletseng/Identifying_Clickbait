"Shape" earns the Hot 100's top Airplay Gainer award for a fourth straight week, the longest streak for a song by a solo male since Justin Bieber 's No. 1 "Love Yourself" (which Sheeran co-wrote, earning him his first Hot 100 leader as a writer) linked four weeks in January-February 2016. "Shape" keeps at No. 2 on both Digital Song Sales (115,000 downloads sold, essentially even week-over-week) and Streaming Songs (33.3 million U.S. streams, up 5 percent). The single introduces Sheeran's third studio album, , due March 3.  Migos ' "Bad and Boujee," featuring Lil Uzi Vert, stays at No. 2 on the Hot 100 after three nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1.

Lady Gaga's "Million Reasons" vaults back onto the Hot 100 at No. 4 after she performed the trackÂ as part of her Super Bowl halftime show. The ballad makes a revival similar to that of the New England Patriots, who erased a 28-3 deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28, in the game.

Gaga earns her 14th top 10 Hot 100 hit and 10th top five single. She last appeared in the top five with the No. 4-peaking "Applause" on the chart dated Sept. 7, 2013. She scores her fifth No. 1 on Digital Song Sales (where "Reasons" first reached No. 6 in December) and first in six years; she last boasted the week's top-selling song with "Born This Way," which led for four weeks in February-March 2011.
