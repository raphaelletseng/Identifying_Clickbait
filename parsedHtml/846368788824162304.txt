Govt Rejects MS Dhoni, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh And Arnab Goswami's Names For Padma Awards The government has turned down proposals to grant the Padma Awards to some prominent politicians and celebrities. The list includes BJD MP Baijayant Panda, spiritual leader Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, air hostess (the late) Neerja Bhanot, former Indian cricket captain MS Dhoni and table maestro Zakir Hussain. Months after the Padma Award List for 2017 was announced, the Home Ministry released the list of people who were dropped. The names of NCP chief Sharad Pawar and BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, who were awarded the Padma Vibhushan, are not on the nomination list. The two fall under the “Public Affairs” category, and per government’s discretion, they have already been awarded the highest civilian honour. The award ceremony is likely to take place later this month at Rashtrapati Bhawan. The Home Ministry has, however, not cited the reasons for rejecting the names.
