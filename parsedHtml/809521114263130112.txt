Nick Chubb, Sony Michel Announce They Will Return to Georgia in 2017
Georgia Bulldogs star running backs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel will return for their senior seasons in 2017, head coach Kirby Smart announced Thursday at a regularly-scheduled press conference, per Seth Emerson of DawgNation.

Chubb offered insight into his decision, per Anthony Dasher of UGASports.com:

The pair served as a dangerous combination in 2016, with Chubb rushing 207 times for 988 yards and seven touchdowns, while Michel chipped in with 753 yards and three touchdowns on 137 carries.

Chubb was mostly healthy in 2016 after a knee injury last October cost him the remainder of the 2015 season. He is Georgia's most dangerous offensive weapon, even though his numbers were below expectations this year. Nonetheless, they were strong marks, considering his injury and the presence of the talented Michel behind him.

Bleacher Report's Matt Miller was more surprised to see Chubb return to school than he was at Michel's decision. However, during a conference call, ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. told reporters he felt waiting a year to enter the draft was the best option for both players, per David Paschall of the Times Free Press:
