London (CNN) A Hungarian camerawoman who sparked global outrage after she was filmed kicking and tripping refugees has been sentenced to three years' probation, according to Szeged District Court.

Petra Laszlo was caught on camera kicking a young girl and tripping a man running with a child in his arms.

Both were fleeing from police at a holding camp near the town of Roszke, on the Hungary-Serbia border, in September 2015 after about 400 migrants broke through a police line.

The footage, which went viral after it was shared by RTL Television reporter Stephan Richter, has been retweeted over 2,400 times.
