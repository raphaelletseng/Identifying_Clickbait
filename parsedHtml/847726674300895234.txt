Frightening Celebrity Statues
Frightening Celebrity Statues
A statue of a celebrity is meant to be a tribute, but sometimes, these likenesses end up … not so flattering. Monuments erected in recent years to the actresses Lucille Ball and Marilyn Monroe and to the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, among others, leave a little something to be desired. In some cases, fans revolted. And they probably should have in the case of the others, too.

A bronze bust of the soccer star was unveiled in March 2017, when an airport was named after him in his hometown of Madeira, Portugal. And it was an immediate hit — on the Internet, where the word “nightmare” was mentioned a lot. By the end of the day, the statue had its own Twitter account. “I’m fairly new to Twitter, and the world, but… people are mean” was one of its first posts. (Photo: Getty Images)
