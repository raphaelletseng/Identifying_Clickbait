YOU'D BE MAKING a mistake to brush off exchange-traded funds as just another contraption designed for Wall Street's gain rather than yours. ETFs are a force for financial justice. They liberate you from three oppressors.

The first on our list of villains is the in-and-out trader. This character does a lot of damage at old-style open-end funds, a.k.a. mutual funds. ETFs are immune.
