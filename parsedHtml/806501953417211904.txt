Bank of Canada holds, says 'economic slack remains'


The Bank of Canada held its key interest rate at 0.50%, as expected, at Wednesday's policy meeting.

In its statement, the BOC said that "dynamics of growth are largely as the Bank anticipated."

The decision comes after a December jobs report that showed the country's unemployment rate dippingÂ to 6.8%, matching its lowest since January 2015. But while people are finding jobs, the quality of those jobs is a bit concerning as they have tended to be of the part-time variety and pay lower wages.Â

On the labor front, the BOC said, "There have been ongoing gains in employment, but a significant amount of economic slack remains in Canada, in contrast to the United States."

As for theÂ economy, it grew at a 3.5% clip in the third quarter asÂ the energy market snapped back and households opened up their wallets. That represented a solid bounce back from the contraction of 1.3% that was seen in the second quarter.Â

Going forward the central bank expects growth to moderate in the fourth quarter. Â

The Canadian dollar is little changed near 1.3270 per dollar following the announcement.Â Â
