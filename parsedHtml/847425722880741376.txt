US GDP growth revised higher in Q4 2016 on stronger consumer spending
GDP BEATS


The US economyÂ grew faster than initially reportedÂ in the fourth quarter of last year, at a pace of 2.1%, according to the Commerce Department's third estimate.

Economists had forecast a revisionÂ to 2% from the second estimate of 1.9%, according to Bloomberg.Â

Consumer spending was stronger than initially thought, and led the overall upward revision. Its growth was reported at 3.5%, up from 3%.

Corporate profits rose by 9.3%, the most in four years. Â

This GDP print is the final reading on fourth-quarter economic growthÂ until annual revisions for all of 2016 are released in July.

It's also the last big piece of economic data that covers Barack Obama's presidency.Â

President Donald Trump has vowed to return the economy to annual growth above 4%.Â However, this would be very difficult to achieve because even after eight years of economic recovery, worker productivity is still quite low. There also isn't enough spare capacity in the labor market to grow by that much.Â Trump's promise is above the most bullish estimates from the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund, among others.Â
