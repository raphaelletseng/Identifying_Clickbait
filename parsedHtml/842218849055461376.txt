Late Wednesday night, Eddie Murphy—a man who is, let's remember, a comedian—tweeted. This by itself is pretty unusual. Murphy's Twitter account is almost entirely retweets—the vast majority, in recent weeks, of praise for his poorly-received new movie Mr. Church.

Other than retweeting pro bowler Shawn Merriman, Murphy gave no indication about whether he was brainstorming, revealing secret plans, musing, or simply trolling. But no matter what he was doing, Murphy got pretty much everyone's attention. A sampling of reactions, below.
