A criminal investigation has been opened in Russia after children were crushed in an appalling escalator accident at a shopping centre.

A video shows scenes of panic when a child stumbles getting off the moving stairway, and others fall over him.

People rushed to help the nine and ten-year-old children trapped helpless on the floor, but more from the group of 44 students at a local school kept coming down the escalator.

Five young girls from School Number 37 in the city of Stavropol remain in hospital suffering from 'lacerations and fractures' sustained in the frightening crush.

'It was lucky no-one was killed as the children piled on top of each other,' said an eyewitness.

Alexander Grets added: 'My 10-year-old sister is among the victims. She had her leg and arm broken.'

And police are now investigating teachers accompanying the group for negligence.

During the scramble, no-one appeared to know how to stop the escalator.

The children had been to the cinema on a school trip and were on their way home.

A representative of Investigative Committee - equivalent of the FBI - said: 'The victims suffered broken bones and lacerated wounds.

'Teachers who accompanied the group of children did not provide safety for the health and lives of the children.'

On deep escalators on the Moscow Metro, security guards routinely monitor passengers, and can halt the moving stairs in the event of problems.
