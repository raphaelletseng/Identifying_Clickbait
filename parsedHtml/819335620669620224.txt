Anderson .Paak and The Free Nationals Announce Upcoming Album


After building up lots of momentum and brand new buzz around his name in 2015, Anderson .Paak kicked off 2016 with the release of his album Malibuâ€”one of the best albums of last year. In the months following the album's release, .Paak and his band The Free Nationals brought the music around the world on tour and during various TV appearances. Now they're gearing up to have another big year.

Last night, .Paak took to Twitter to announce that he and The Free Nationals have a new album on the way this year. There's no word yet on when exactly they aim to release new music but with the band currently gearing up to hit the road with Bruno Mars for his 24k Tour this spring, we can only hope they start previewing new music very soon. As if this news isn't enough, .Paak reportedly has a collaboration with Flying Lotus on the way as well.
