The Washington Redskins and quarterback Kirk Cousins have reportedly engaged in discussions about a long-term contract extension this week.

Master Tesfatsion of the Washington Post reported Thursday the talks haven't led to substantial progress as the sides "aren't close to a deal." The team announced the use of the exclusive franchise tag on Cousins on Tuesday to ensure he wouldn't become an unrestricted free agent.

Chris Wesseling of NFL.com noted the quarterback is set to make $23.94 million if he plays under the tag for the second straight season in 2017. The Redskins were offering an extension in the neighborhood of $20 million per year, according to Tesfatsion.

Washington now has until July 15 in order to reach a long-term agreement with Cousins. That's the deadline to make a new deal with a player who's been tagged.
