Multiple team sources told ESPN on Sunday night that the defensive backs and offensive linemen have exchanged postgame words on at least one other occasion in recent weeks.

Denver (8-6), the defending Super Bowl champion, is in third place in the AFC West. The Broncos must win out and would still need help to earn a wild-card berth.

"Everybody's frustrated," cornerback Chris Harris Jr. told ESPN on Sunday. "We feel like we played almost good enough defense to win that game.
