7 Quick And Easy Money-Saving Ideas For Young Millennials In this era of cashless transactions and online shopping, we millennials are simply just hooked to the idea of instant gratification! After slogging for almost 240 hours a month, the moolah which comes into our bank accounts just goes down the drain during the weekends. So, what are we left with by the end of the month? Practically nothing! Well, that’s why we need to think of saving money, else what’s the whole point of slogging so much, right? Here are some ideas which can help you save up better: 1. Allocate your money spends and follow it strictly. Just follow the 50/30/20 rule blindly. Allocate 50% of your monthly income for essentials like rent, transportations and other home-related bills, 30% on your entertainment choices like shopping or eating out, and the remaining 20% on savings. Prioritize your spends according to this rule. 2. Keep two different accounts – one for your regular usage and one as the not-to-be-touched account. On the same day when your salary gets credited to your account, just transfer a fixed amount of money to the other account. Also, don’t activate the ATM card for this, so that you don’t get tempted to use it. This will serve as an emergency fund when you really need cash, as well as a safe mode of stacking away your cash. 3. Always avail the cash-back services on your E-wallets. Never ignore those cash-back offers which keep popping up on your screen. That doesn’t mean that you get to spend extra but rather use it wisely. This will make you feel instantly rich when you get the credited amount. Plus, you can use the credited amount the next time you buy something instead of shelling out more money. 4. Do your big shopping only once a month from a discount shop. Instead of going for shopping sessions every day (and getting tempted to buy not-so-important stuff too), make it a point to go for your major shopping only once a month. Get friendly with someone from the Army to take you to the Army canteen, or probably a large supermarket, or try online shopping where you can get discount deals! This practice will help you limit your spends only towards the really essential stuff, and avoid the extra baggage. 5. Try to invest atleast a small amount every month in SIPs or mutual fund. Definitely starting early with investments has a big impact on your finances. Did you know that if you invested just Rs.5,000 in a monthly SIP in a top equity mutual fund, say 5 years ago, today it would have become a whopping Rs.6.4 lakh in your account? Though it sounds dramatic, it is pretty much possible! Investing in SIPs by diverting a fixed amount every month is a sensible way to increase your money. 6. Buy a life insurance cover for your loved ones and save money as well. Sometimes during our day to day hustle, we get so concerned about the present day that we hardly tend to think about planning for the financial future of our loved ones. That’s when a life insurance plays an important role. It’s always better to get insured now itself as the premiums increase with age. So the earlier you start, the premium gets locked at lower rates and over the years the savings get huge. 7. Use a budgeting app to keep track of your finances. While it’s easy to list down the hacks, implementing them is difficult in real life. Nevertheless, the good news is that there are now options available specifically built for millennials, like the ETMONEY app . This will help you not only take control of your money, but also help you invest and get insured from the app itself. It is surely a lifesaver. If you still aren't convinced enough, you would surely be when you see your favourite cricketers Akshar Patel, Parthiv Patel, Sheldon Jackson, Karun Nair, Manish Pandey and Vijay Shankar talking about how they are going to manage their money while they rake in crores this season.
