Warren Buffett isn't your typical billionaire.

And with a net worth of√Ç $70 billion, he lives a modest lifestyle.

Buffett still lives in the house he bought in 1957 for $31,000, forgoes private jets for public transportation, and plays bridge instead of throwing parties.

His lifestyle was recently captured in the HBO's documentary "Becoming Warren Buffett."
