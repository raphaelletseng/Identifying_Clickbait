Huge LED screens will come up at stations, platforms and foot overbridges (leading to station areas) for advertising.

The train branding packages will be offered through bidding in a phased manner, starting with Rajdhani and Shatabdi services. The Railways is also trying to reach big names from the advertising world for spaces on trains, level crossings and areas along tracks besides offering major platforms for installing over 2,000 ATMs.
