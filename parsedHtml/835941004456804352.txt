The manager of the bar where the incident took place told French media he saw an attacker with a saw and “intervened before something more serious happened” but did notice any religious symbols. “I saw neither Jew nor Muslim nor Christian nor atheist at the scene,” he added. No arrests have been made in relation to the attack. It came amid fears over anti-Semitic violence in France, where a gunman loyal to Isis killed four people at a kosher supermarket in January 2015. Extremist gunman Mohammed Merah also targeted a Jewish school in a shooting spree that left seven people dead in 2012, while the Brussels Jewish Museum was attacked by an Isis supporter in neighbouring Brussels in 2014. France, which has the third-largest Jewish population in the world, has seen a decrease in reported anti-Semitic attacks over the past two years according to interior ministry figures . Bondy lies near the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, which has been hit by waves of protests and rioting following a police officer’s alleged rape of a black man.
