Watch Sourav Ganguly Play Gully Cricket On Streets Of Kolkata, That Too Right-Handed! One of India's most successful cricket captains, Sourav Ganguly was recently seen playing gully cricket on the streets of Kolkata. What's more, he also batted right-handed. Batting with a tennis ball, Ganguly displayed all the shots he was known for - the frontfoot drive, the backfoot pull and the heave straight down the ground, just like the way he used to punish spinners. He also managed to hurt his shoulder a bit but that didn't stop him from showcase his full array of strokes. Being a natural right-hander who just bats left-handed, Ganguly batted right-handed too. Surely, these visuals prove that at 44, age is just a number when is comes to passion for your sport.
