Ben Affleck has in recent weeks gone back and forth (and back, and forth) about almost every aspect of the (supposedly) upcoming new standalone Batman film—to be titled, creatively, The Batman.

Whether it would even happen, whether the script was any good—all of these things were up in the air. But perhaps most hotly debated issue was whether Affleck, an award-winning director, would helm the film himself. Now, we finally have an answer.

Collider is reporting Affleck issued a statement saying that, while he would still play the bat-who-is-a-man, he would not be behind the camera.

“There are certain characters who hold a special place in the hearts of millions. Performing this role demands focus, passion and the very best performance I can give. It has become clear that I cannot do both jobs to the level they require. Together with the studio, I have decided to find a partner in a director who will collaborate with me on this massive film. I am still in this, and we are making it, but we are currently looking for a director. I remain extremely committed to this project, and look forward to bringing this to life for fans around the world.”

There is no word yet about who will be directing The Batman. But there is, naturally, plenty of speculation—and some wishful thinking.
