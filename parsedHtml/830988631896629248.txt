Katy Perry Makes A Political Statement With 'Persist' Armband At Grammys
Katy Perry has always spoken her mind. On Sunday night, she took the opportunity to make a political statement while performing her new song “Chained to the Rhythm” at the Grammy Awards .

Katy Perry has always spoken her mind.

On Sunday night, she took the opportunity to make a political statement while performing her new song “Chained to the Rhythm” at the Grammy Awards.

The singer, who was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton, wore a white pantsuit with an armband that read “PERSIST” during her performance with Skip Marley, finishing out the act by yelling out “No hate!” while standing against a backdrop that showed the beginning of the Constitution.

While the statement wasn’t explicitly about President Donald Trump’s administration, we can read between the lines. Her armband seems like a nod to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s quote about Elizabeth Warren’s attempt to read a letter criticizing Jeff Sessions, which soon became a feminist rallying cry: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”

Perry released the song on Friday and tweeted that we are now in the era of “purposeful pop.”

We gonna call this era Purposeful Pop. 👁 https://t.co/fCllqtlRTm — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) February 10, 2017
