As the NFL continues to expand its presence in England, it may have an owner there on a full-time basis.

The New York Post reports that Jets owner Woody Johnson is under consideration for the position of ambassador to the United Kingdom. Johnson, who supported President-Elect Donald Trump, is a “leading contender” for the position, according to the report.

Steelers chairman Dan Rooney served as ambassador to Ireland from 2009 through 2012. He was appointed to the position by President Barack Obama.
