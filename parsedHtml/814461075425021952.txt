There was dark humour

Anger

FUCK THIS UGLY YEAR#2016In4Words â€” JOHNLORD (@johnlordperry) December 29, 2016

Swearing

Incredulity

Real bad

Racism

Homophobia

Sadness#2016in4words â€” ANES (@AnesGali) December 28, 2016

Very literal

The year after 2015. #2016In4Words â€” Boring Tweeter (@b0ringtweets) December 28, 2016

There were *some* positives

I survived 2016 , kids



#2016In4Words â€” Ryaan (@IoneIywolf) December 29, 2016

But not many

The struggle has been real

Memes removed the pain #2016In4Words â€” memes (@memeprovider) December 29, 2016

The struggle has been relentless

Celebrity deaths were inevitably mentioned

A lot

#2016In4Words Guess who died today â€” Isabull (@isabellesk8) December 29, 2016

And so was politics

And combinations of the two

#2016In4Words

Deaths and stupid votes. â€” James Melville (@JamesMelville) December 28, 2016

Harambe got a mention

#2016in4Words Rest In Peace Harambe â€” Luke Brooks (@luke_brooks) December 29, 2016

Several, in fact

One gorilla changed everything#2016In4Words â€” dean (@Deano_vW) December 28, 2016

In summary, people were not big fans of 2016

They're really glad it's nearly done

But beware...

There's still time.
