Drake Got a Sade-Inspired Tattoo Because of Course He Did
Drake Got a Sade-Inspired Tattoo Because of Course He Did
It's not really a secret that Drake has been a huge admirer of English singer/songwriter Sade because, with Drake, if he likes something he's not shy about letting the world know about it (see Rihanna, the Raptors, etc.) It's also no secret that the man is a lover of getting his body etched up with tattoos . Especially over the past few days . We're going to bring these full circle in, like, two seconds. I promise. Sade's mutual respect for Drizzy shined through this week, as she stopped by his Boy Meets World Tour while it was in London, and he managed to snap , but two pictures for the 'gram with the famously reclusive artist. This, of course, is no easy feat. One of them was just him and Sade: 🌺 A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 21, 2017 at 6:54pm PDT And another was of him, Sade, and his mom: Two very important ladies in my life. 🌺 A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 20, 2017 at 7:00pm PDT On top of that, it turns out his fandom is big enough to get Sade's portrait permanently etched on his torso. That recently dried mark was posted onto the IG of Swedish tattoo artist Niki Norberg . Let's hope this was a well-thought-out idea: 🇸🇪🇨🇦 "with love Sade' X" @champagnepapi #bishoprotary #nocturnalink #inkeeze #radiantcolorsink #morelife #drake #sorryforblurrypic A post shared by Art👈🏼 Tattoo👈🏼Laser👈🏼 (@niki23gtr) on Mar 22, 2017 at 9:26am PDT In life there are tributes, obsessions, and then some gray areas. We'll leave it up to you to decide which category this goes in. But don't be surprised if we're writing one of these about Doris Burke at some point in the near future.
