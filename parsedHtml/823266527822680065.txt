That didn't take long: Trump's press secretary is already a meme
That didn't take long: Trump's press secretary is already a meme
We're one day into the Trump presidency and the memes are already flying. President Donald Trump's Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave a press conference Saturday in which he complained about the media's "false" reporting of crowd numbers at the inauguration. Although he admitted to not having any, you know, hard figures, he declared:  "This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe." SEE ALSO: All the best protest signs from Women's Marches across America In so many ways, he was just plain wrong. Pictures from President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009 show many more people on the mall than on Saturday, and D.C.'s transport agency told the that 570,557 people took trips Friday compared to 1.1 million trips in 2009. Nielsen also estimated that about 31 million viewers watched TV coverage of the day —  less than Obama and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations. Not to mention, Spicer claimed that Trump's inauguration was the first time "floor coverings" had been used to protect grass on the National Mall, making empty space more obvious. He was also wrong: Tarps have been used before. Now people on the internet have suggestions for some other "yuge" inaccurate facts Spicer could share next. Of course, there's already the inevitable Twitter account as well as the #SpicerFacts hashtag. Guess the number of jelly beans.

We're one day into the Trump presidency and the memes are already flying.

President Donald Trump's Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave a press conference Saturday in which he complained about the media's "false" reporting of crowd numbers at the inauguration.

Although he admitted to not having any, you know, hard figures, he declared: "This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe."

In so many ways, he was just plain wrong. Pictures from President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009 show many more people on the mall than on Saturday, and D.C.'s transport agency told the Washington Post that 570,557 people took trips Friday compared to 1.1 million trips in 2009.

Nielsen also estimated that about 31 million viewers watched TV coverage of the day — less than Obama and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations.

Not to mention, Spicer claimed that Trump's inauguration was the first time "floor coverings" had been used to protect grass on the National Mall, making empty space more obvious. He was also wrong: Tarps have been used before.

Now people on the internet have suggestions for some other "yuge" inaccurate facts Spicer could share next. Of course, there's already the inevitable Twitter account @SeanSpicerFacts as well as the #SpicerFacts hashtag.

Guess the number of jelly beans.
