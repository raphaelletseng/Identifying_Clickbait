Celebrities Turned Out in Droves in Support of Nationwide Women's Marches
Celebrities Turned Out in Droves in Support of Nationwide Women's Marches
Celebrities were among the hundreds of thousands of people who marched in cities across the country Saturday in protest of Donald Trump and the threat he poses to women’s rights. Naturally, the largest number of boldface names attended the Women’s March on Washington, the event that spawned what has become a global movement. After celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and America Ferrer a addressed the sprawling masses, it was Madonna who left the biggest impression, after dropping the F-bomb three times during her impassioned speech. Madonna has two words for the haters: pic.twitter.com/UfwC44dUpA “Yes, I’m angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know this won’t change anything,” she said. “We cannot fall into despair. As the poet W.H. Auden wrote on the eve of World War II: ‘We must love one another or die. I choose love’.” You can watch her full speech above. NSFW Ashley Judd gave one of the more memorable speeches of the day, when she recited a poem called “Nasty Women,” written by 19 year-old Nina Donovan. “And our p—ies ain’t for grabbing. There for reminding you that our walls are stronger than America’s ever will be,” Judd read. “Our p—ies are for our pleasure. They are for birthing new generations of filthy, vulgar, nasty, proud, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh, you name it, for new generations of nasty women. So if you a nasty woman, or you love one who is, let me hear you say, hell yeah.” Other celebrities hit the streets, and flooded social media with images and messages of strength and unity.

Marching with SO many sisters today but my heart is most proud to march with my blood sister, Angela, who has always been my guardian angel. We should all be guardians for each other. I march today because I am not afraid anymore and I hope I can be an example of fearlessness and resilience. I will not let anyone suppress me, silence me or clip my wings. For a long time I misunderstood the true definition of being a feminist, but now that I know, I am empowered! I am indisputably a feminist. I am here today to break the cycle of suppression and inequality. I stand with you all! ❤#whyimarch @womensmarch A photo posted by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Jan 21, 2017 at 6:26am PST “Marching with so many sisters today but my heart is most proud to march with my blood sister, Angela, who has always been my guardian angel,” Perry wrote. “We should all be guardians for each other.

Madge also performed her hits “Express Yourself” and “Human Nature,” with some new NSFW lyrics aimed directly at the new president.

Ashley Judd gave one of the more memorable speeches of the day, when she recited a poem called “Nasty Women,” written by 19 year-old Nina Donovan.

Over in Park City, Utah, where the Sundance Film Festival is officially underway, Chelsea Handler led a star-studded march down Main Street, that included Kristen Stewart (who was wearing an "I'm With Meryl" sticker), Charlize Theron and John Legend.
