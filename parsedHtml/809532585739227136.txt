Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds finally decided to bless the world with the gift of their adorable offspring.

Lively brought daughters James, 2, and their newborn (whose name the public does not know yet) to Reynolds’ Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony in Los Angeles Thursday. The actress was photographed in the front row with their kids, taking photos, and little James even made her way up to the podium to help her dad celebrate.

The “Deadpool” star thanked his wife when he accepted the honor.

“I want to thank my wife, Blake, who is sitting right there, who is everything to me,” he said, according to People. “You are the best thing, the best thing that has ever happened to me — second only to this star. …You make everything better, absolutely everything in my life better. You’ve made me the father of my dreams when I thought I only had fun uncle potential.”

Ugh, adopt us all, please!
