We're back on Dow 20,000 watch.Â

Stocks are rallying on Friday after the DecemberÂ jobs report showed that wage growth rose at the fastest pace since 2009.Â

The Dow rose to as high as 19,999.63 in early afternoon trading, crossing the previous intraday highÂ it reached on December 20. Disney, Goldman Sachs and Nike were the biggest gainers on the index.

The S&P 500, which is considered a broader benchmark of the US stock market, also rose to a new highÂ of 2,281.75.

Meanwhile, selling across the Treasury complex has yields higher for the first time in 2017, with the belly of the curve climbing by more than 8Â basis points.

The economy added 156,000 jobs last month, which was fewer than expected, but extended the record streak of job creation in the US.Â Average hourly earnings increased by 2.9% year-on-year.

Besides the positive news from the economy on Friday, markets remain optimistic about growth under the incoming administration. Lower corporate taxes and lighter regulation could boost earnings growth, which some strategists including Fundstrat's Tom Lee say will take over asÂ the key driver of stocks this year.Â
