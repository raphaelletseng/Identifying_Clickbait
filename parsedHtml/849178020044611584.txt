Syria conflict: Suspected gas attack kills more than 58 in north-western province of Idlib

Updated

A suspected gas attack by Syrian Government or Russian jets killed at least 58 people, including nine children, in the north-western province of Idlib, a British-based war monitoring group says.

The attack caused many people to choke or faint, and some had foam coming out of their mouths, the Syrian Observatory for Human rights said, citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack.

The air strikes also wounded more than 60 people in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib, the Observatory said.

Video posted online by opposition activists showed the lifeless bodies of children laid out on the back of a truck, and activists circulated pictures showing a reported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor.

Damascus has repeatedly denied using any such weapons but the United Nations has accused both the regime and opposition forces of staging chemical attacks.

A Syrian military source said the army "does not and has not" used chemical weapons, "not in the past and not in the future".

Pro-opposition Orient News television said the strikes had killed 50 people and injured more than 150.
