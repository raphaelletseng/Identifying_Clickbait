Hair, Sperm, Libido, Delhi Men Are Losing It The Most At the end of 2016, there's bad news for Delhi men - they are losing their hair, sperm and libido. A new survey conducted by a city-based healthcare startup found that 63 per cent of Delhi men (between the ages of 30-40) have a sperm count of less than 10 million/ml. That's half of the national average of 20 million/ml, according to a 2013 AIIMS report. The survey conducted by Dalmia Medicare analysed 1, 90,000 diagnostic tests carried out in the Delhi NCR region in 2016 to come up with these findings. "When we started the study in January, the percentage of men with a low sperm count was 14%. By November, this had risen to 27%," says Dr Sunita Yadav, head quality, Dalmia Medicare. Delhi men also fared poorly in their testosterone tests with 60 per cent of those tested falling in the lower range -- below 300-350 (normal range is 300-1200ng/dl). Dr Yadav blamed stress, smoking, increased air pollution as some of the factors for this trend. Other scientific studies too have linked air pollution to poor quality of semen. A 2014 study done by researchers in China found that city-dwelling men had higher levels of abnormally shaped sperm, and with low motility, than their rural counterparts. The Delhi survey also found that 70 per cent of men (average age 25) faced some kind of hair loss. Majority of them were found to be deficient in Vitamin B complex mainly B3 and B12. Smokers also had a high incidence of hair loss as compared to non-smokers since nicotine hampers blood flow and affects hair growth.
