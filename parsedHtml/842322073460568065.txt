Donald Trump, Federal Reserve, Dutch Elections: Your Thursday Briefing
A federal judge in Hawaii has stopped President Trump’s ban on travel from six predominantly Muslim countries from taking effect nationwide. It was the second setback for Mr. Trump’s pursuit of a policy he says is critical for national security. His first attempt was also blocked by courts. In his decision on the new, narrower ban, the judge in Honolulu wrote that it appeared “to disfavor a particular religion.” (Here are some highlights from the judicial order .) “This ruling makes us look weak,” Mr. Trump responded. Mr. Trump will send a budget to Congress today that would increase spending for the Pentagon and on defending the southern border, while cutting funds for foreign aid, poverty programs and the environment. The president’s proposal represents an “America First” budget that, in one reporter’s analysis, makes parts of America more first than others . We look at who wins and who loses (including arts groups whose government funding would be eliminated ). Advertisement Lawmakers threatened subpoenas and vented about the lack of evidence behind Mr. Trump’s accusation on Twitter that President Barack Obama had wiretapped phones in Trump Tower during the campaign. Advertisement If the president’s comments are taken literally, he is simply “wrong,” one Republican said. Mr. Trump, however, suggested in an interview that he would be vindicated: “Wiretap covers a lot of different things,” he said. (If you’ve lost track of the White House’s responses to the controversy, here’s a quick refresher .) Advertisement Mr. Trump urged his supporters to unite behind the Republican plan to overhaul health care, but Speaker Paul D. Ryan, facing resistance to the bill within his party, said it would be refined and improved. The party of the populist politician Geert Wilders gained seats in Parliament in Dutch elections on Wednesday but fell short of expectations. Advertisement Voters turned out in record numbers, and the result was cheered by those hoping to stall the anti-European Union, anti-Muslim forces that Mr. Wilders symbolizes.

Back Story

A new space race is underway, fueled by billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos who are eager to capitalize on booming technology and the allure of space tourism.

Such audacious plans weren’t always embraced. In 1920, when Robert H. Goddard outlined how a rocket might reach the moon, The Times wrote that he seemed “to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools” and argued, incorrectly, that thrust was not possible in a vacuum.
