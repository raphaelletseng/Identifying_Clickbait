We can't cope with more than four conversations at once


Scientists have discovered why a dinner party can be as stressful for the guests as it is for the hosts.

New research has revealed that the average person cannot cope with more than four conversations at once.

Any more and we struggle, because most humans lack the brain power to consider multiple points of view at the same time.

And those who are most able to cope are likely to be women, according to psychologist Dr Jaimie Krems.

Dr Krems said: ‘People cannot handle more than a four-person conversation – known as “the dinner party problem” – because we don’t have the cognitive resources to do so.

‘By cognitive resources, I mean mental ability – one can model only so many other minds, putting oneself in the mental shoes of someone else, at any one time – on average, between three and four.’

And she believes women may have an evolutionary advantage over men because they are ‘better able to track some social information’.

Dr Krems’ research, conducted at Arizona State University and published in the journal Evolution And Human Behavior, studied about 200 people while they took part in conversations.
