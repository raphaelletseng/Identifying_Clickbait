every time I find something in forever 21                                   The overlap between dresses you like and dresses you can wear a bra with is minuscule.                                                                                   I spent $130 on jeans with fake front pockets... #truereligion what is this??? #fakepockets The worst deception.    a song about women's winter clothing called "even my coat has no pockets"    looool wtf is this topshop                                                                                                                                                                                                                Only at #urbanoutfitters a red t shirt with holes in it for $160                                                                     What if the medium is too big but the small is too small?                                      when I'm tryin on clothes & my makeup & hair isn't done
