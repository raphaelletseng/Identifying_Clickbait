Lin-Manuel Captioned A Picture With J.K. Rowling With A "Harry Potter" Quote
Lin-Manuel went to the BAFTAs tonight and seemed to be having a fantastic time. #BAFTAs But one of the highlights of his night seemed to be when he got a picture with J.K. Rowling. All was well. The best part about the whole picture is that Lin-Manuel captioned the picture with a Harry Potter quote. J.K. Rowling wasn’t the only person Lin-Manuel had a fanboy moment over. He also met Pixar legend John Lasseter. Lasseter is wearing a shirt with every Pixar character like a quite literal boss. #BAFTAs Looks like Lin-Manuel had a great night!
