White House says Trump has resigned from his businesses


President Donald Trump resigned from his businesses as he promised earlier this month, White House strategic communications director Hope Hicks said Monday, CNN's Jim Acosta reported.Â

Trump said earlier this month that he would step down from his positions at his businesses. He said his two adult sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., in addition to a senior Trump Organization executive, would lead the company.

The announcement comes as the first major lawsuit related to Trump's potential conflicts of interest was filed Monday by the left-leaning ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.Â

Many ethics experts have said Trump's arrangement to clearÂ up conflicts does not go far enough, sayingÂ that the only way to come clean would be to divest in entirety or place the assets into a blind trust run by an independent manager. They have also claimedÂ that TrumpÂ is still in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution, which was the basis of CREW's lawsuit.
