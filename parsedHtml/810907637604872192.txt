Zsa Zsa Gabor in her own words - BBC News


Zsa Zsa Gabor, famed for her nine marriages and her way with words, has died at the age of 99.

Here are some of her most memorable comments:

"Husbands are like fires. They go out when unattended."

"A man in love is incomplete until he has married. Then he's finished."

On former husband George Sanders: "We were both in love with him. I fell out of love with him but he didn't."

"We were both in love with him. I fell out of love with him but he didn't." "When I'm alone, I can sleep crossways in bed without an argument."

"Never despise what it says in the women's magazines - it may not be subtle but neither are men."

"To be loved is a strength. To love is a weakness."

"Macho does not prove mucho."
