Florida Apologizes for ‘Gross Injustices’ to Four Black Men, Decades Later
Florida Apologizes for ‘Gross Injustices’ to Four Black Men, Decades Later
More than a half-century after a violent, dramatic criminal case in central Florida earned national attention, the State Senate passed a resolution Thursday apologizing to the families of four black men who were “victims of racial hatred” and “gross injustices” during the era of state-sanctioned segregation in the American South. The so-called Groveland Four — Charles Greenlee, Ernest Thomas, Walter Irvin and Samuel Shepherd — were accused of raping a white woman in 1949 near the city of Groveland in Lake County, Fla. One was killed within days. Three were beaten in custody and convicted. Of those, one was shot dead on his way to a retrial. They are all dead now. The resolution, which earlier passed the Florida House, extended a “heartfelt apology” for their mistreatment and wrongful convictions, and urged Gov. Rick Scott to grant them full pardons. “We’re very hopeful that the governor and his cabinet will appreciate the message that’s being sent,” said Gary Farmer, a Democrat in the Senate who sponsored the bill along with Bobby DuBose, a Democrat in the House. “It’s bipartisan, and there’s really no question about these men’s innocence.” Advertisement By the side of the road, 1949 The resolution relays the reported facts of the case in excruciating detail: WHEREAS, on July 16, 1949, a 17-year-old white woman and her estranged husband reported to police that she had been abducted at approximately 2:30 a.m., driven approximately 25 minutes to a dead-end road, and raped by four black men … By the end of the night, law enforcement had arrested three young men — Mr. Irvin, Mr. Greenlee and Mr. Shepherd — who would be severely beaten by the authorities. Mr. Thomas, meanwhile, “understanding the racial realities of the time and the danger he was in,” had fled the county, the resolution said. A posse of about 1,000 men tracked him down days later in nearby swamps, where he died “in a hail of gunfire.” N.A.A.C.P. lawyers, including Franklin Williams and Thurgood Marshall, took an active role in the men’s defense. Advertisement It was clear to them that at least two, Mr. Greenlee and Mr. Thomas, were never at the scene of the alleged crime; that the beatings had led to forced confessions; and that important evidence, including a medical examination of the woman, was never presented in court. Advertisement An all-white jury sentenced Mr. Irvin and Mr. Shepherd to death, and Mr. Greenlee to life in prison. Mr. Williams and Mr. Marshall appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, where the convictions were unanimously overturned in 1951. But the story was far from over.

The sheriff would claim that he had stopped to fix a flat tire, that the two men had tried to attack him, and that he had shot them in self-defense. Mr. Irvin survived. From a hospital bed, he told investigators that after the sheriff shot him twice, another official, Deputy Sheriff James L. Yates, shot him again in the neck, at point-blank range, while he lay on the ground.
