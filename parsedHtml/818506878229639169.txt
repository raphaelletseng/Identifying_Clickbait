Last month we wrote about Glassdoor’s annual “best places to work” list, a ranking based on employee-submitted reviews. Today we’re looking at some of the high-paying positions these companies offer. Glassdoor has that data too—it identified jobs among the best places to work that earn $100,000 or more and are available now, covering a wide range of roles. To qualify for the list, a job needed at least ten salary reports submitted by Glassdoor users.

Most of these roles require at least 5 years’ experience. The exceptions are the most technical positions, which tend to pay more. For the full list (ordered alphabetically by company), view the gallery below.

At top-rated employer Adobe, product managers make a median salary of $133,000, according to Glassdoor. For new and existing products, such as mobile apps, Adobe product managers set the vision and create the roadmap. They research customer preferences and define products’ features. Then they speak with engineers, who bring the product to life. It’s not easy to become a product manager at Adobe (or at any blue chip tech company). You need a track record in managing successful products, a bachelor’s degree in engineering and an MBA from a top-tier school or “equivalent experience.” Among the 11 U.S. jobs covered in this post, Adobe’s was the only one that listed a top-tier degree as a requirement.

At Apple, global supply managers make $129,000. They figure out where Apple will get the materials used to make its products. Based on the job description, Apple expects its supply managers to recommend product innovations and show an interest in competitive behavior, negotiation and manufacturing processes. To qualify for the role, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree, plus six to eight years’ experience or a master’s degree. Candidates must also be able to “make quick decisions with 80% information.”

Marketing managers at Clorox earn $142,000. They research consumer product categories to understand customers and develop marketing plans. They also help determine product prices, a critical decision given how many items Clorox sells. In its marketing manager candidates, Clorox looks for a marketing or business degree and five years’ experience at a consumer goods company, according to a Buenos Aires-based job description.

At market research firm Forrester, senior analysts earn $133,000. Their primary function is to conduct research and deliver written reports and consulting. One current senior analyst opening specializes in helping brands sell their products directly to consumers, instead of through retailers. To qualify you’ll need five to seven years’ experience working in a related industry. A bachelor’s degree is required, and a master’s is preferred.
