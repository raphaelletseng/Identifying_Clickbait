A woman has been removed from an Alaska Airlines flight after berating the President Trump supporter seated next to her.

Scott Koteskey - the man she confronted - filmed the incident and uploaded it to Facebook.

The airline told the BBC the woman had insulted other passengers before boarding the plane, and that it stood by the employee who decided to remove her.
