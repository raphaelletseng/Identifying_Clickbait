Zsa Zsa Gabor, who died on Sunday at 99, lived a long and glamorous life in the spotlight. She married nine men and had several other whirlwind romances. Gabor was famously quoted as saying, “I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man, I keep his house.”

Gabor’s second husband was Conrad Hilton, who was 55 years old when they married in 1942. Gabor was in her mid-20s, and later said in her memoir that she became pregnant with their child, Francesca, after Hilton raped her. The couple divorced in 1947.
