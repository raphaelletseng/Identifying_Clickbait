With 2016 being the second-warmest year on record, and with issues like high executive pay and diversity gaining more awareness, you may be curious to know what companies care most about sustainability. Since 2005, Toronto-based magazine and research firm Corporate Knights has put together the Global 100, an annual list of the world’s most sustainable companies. Using publicly available data, Corporate Knights rates large firms on 14 key measures, evaluating their management of resources, finances and employees.

For the ranking, Corporate Knights considers about 4,000 companies with market values of at least $2 billion (methodology details here). It’s an intensive research undertaking, taking about 1,000 hours each year to produce. Corporate Knights just released the 2017 edition and will present the results today at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

For the top 20 on the Global 100, open the gallery below. For the full list, see the end of this post.

Siemens, the German industrial conglomerate whose businesses range from power plants to medical imaging machines, took the top spot. It was the most energy-efficient firm in its sector, producing more revenue per kilowatt used than any other industrial corporation. Siemens scored highly on nearly every metric in Corporate Knights’ ranking, such as having a low carbon footprint and low employee turnover. The conglomerate is also dedicating a growing portion of its business to creating environmentally friendly infrastructure, with products like green heating and air conditioning systems.

Norwegian insurance company Storebrand ASA came in second. Across all measures, it performed strongest on executive pay. Storebrand’s CEO gets paid just 12 times more than the average Storebrand employee. That may sound like a huge gap, but among firms in the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), a basket of stocks designed to represent a wide range of companies across the globe, CEOs make 115 times more than their firms’ workers.

“Scandinavians tend to be more rational about many business practices,” says Corporate Knights founder Toby Heaps, who’s critical of firms with sky-high CEO salaries. “I have yet to see compelling academic evidence that you generate additional shareholder returns by paying CEOs excessive salaries.”

American networking technology company Cisco ranked third on the Global 100 and fared particularly well on Corporate Knights’ diversity measure: 38% of Cisco’s senior executives are women, compared with 21% for ACWI companies, according to Heaps. Corporate Knights doesn’t currently track racial diversity. Heaps says the available data isn’t as reliable, but thinks it’s just a matter of time before it becomes standard.

Heaps points out several ways in which Global 100 companies differ from the ACWI basket. At 80% of Global 100 firms, top executives receive higher bonuses if the company meets sustainability targets. Across the ACWI, only 23% of companies offer such bonuses. Global 100 CEOs make eighty times the salary of average employees, while ACWI company CEOs make 115 times the rank and file.

For pension payments, Global 100 firms contribute almost twice as much per employee compared to all ACWI companies. 28% of board seats at Global 100 firms are held by women compared with 21% for the broader ACWI. And Global 100 organizations are 25% more energy efficient.

You might think companies that invest heavily in sustainability might incur higher costs and become less profitable. But the Global 100’s stock returns suggest otherwise. If you had invested $100 in Global 100 companies in 2005, it would have been worth $232 at the of 2016. If you did the same for the ACWI, you’d have $208. In other words, the Global 100’s cumulative return is 24 percentage points higher than the ACWI benchmark.

The countries with the biggest share of Global 100 companies were the U.S. (19), France (12), the U.K. (11), Canada (6), Germany (6) and the Netherlands (5).
