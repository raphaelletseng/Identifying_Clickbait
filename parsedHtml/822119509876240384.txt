  Reward offered after dog in Detroit has its nose and ears cut off



Authorities in the US are trying to track down whoever is responsible for maiming and abandoning a dog.

The Michigan Humane Society has released a photo of the Rottweiler mix, which was found in Detroit on Tuesday with its ears and nose cut off.

The society says a member of the public called them after spotting the dog, which was taken to vets and treated.

Investigator Mark Ramos says the maiming has caused the dog "a great deal of suffering".

"It appears that someone purposely maimed this poor dog," he said.

"This kind of cruelty is unacceptable. We need to be a voice for these animals and as a community we need to speak through our strong actions to make sure this doesn't happen again.

"If you know anything about this case, call the MHS hotline now at (313) 872-3401 and help us find the person responsible. This animal deserves justice."

The Michigan Humane Society is offering a $2,500 (Â£2,030) reward for the arrest and conviction of whoever hurt the dog.

It also had cuts to its tail and back legs.

Last year, a man from South Carolina who wrapped electrical tape around the muzzle of a dog admitted animal cruelty.

Caitlyn, a stray Staffordshire mix, lost part of her tongue and had several surgeries after turning up at a rescue home in Charleston with her mouth bound shut.

Meanwhile, earlier last year a dog was found wandering around the streets of Darlington, South Carolina, with duct tape around its muzzle and head.

Vets said the tape didn't do any permanent damage to its head or muzzle area.
