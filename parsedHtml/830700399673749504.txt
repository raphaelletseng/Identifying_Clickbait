Here's All You Need To Know About ISRO's Record Breaking Launch Of 104 Satellites In One Go
Here's Everything You Need To Know About ISRO's World Record Setting Launch Of 104 Satellites In One Go Using PSLV-C37 The much laudable ISRO's task of launching a record-breaking 104 satellites in one go using its workhorse PSLV-C37 in the first week of February has been making headlines for a couple of weeks now. "We are making a century by launching over 100 satellites at one go," said S Somnath, Director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre of the ISRO.

But with the addition of 20 more foreign satellites, the launch was delayed by a week and will now take place in the first week of February, Somnath said. Let's look at the launch in detail:

#4 The PSLV will also carry a main remote-sensing satellite in the Cartosat-2 series and two small spacecraft.

#5 Yes, only 3 of these will be Indian satellites.

Apart from the US and India, Germany is participating in this launch too.

The launch will be a major feat in country's space history as no exercise on this scale has been attempted before. Since September 2015, the PSLV has launched 18 small US earth imaging satellites and in a total of 79 foreign spacecraft — which earns it some revenue and an increasingly global market share.
