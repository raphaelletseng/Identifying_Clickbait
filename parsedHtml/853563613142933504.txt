Disney shows off Star Wars Land, and just shut up and take our money
ORLANDO — The Disney Parks mega-project known as Star Wars Land is well underway both here and in Anaheim, California. And the Mouse House is ready to let us in on a few of its secrets. In a panel at Star Wars Celebration on Saturday, Disney Imagineers and Lucasfilm luminaries revealed tantalizing new details on a theme park that sounds more elaborate and unusual than any yet built on Earth. SEE ALSO: Star Wars land gets even more awesome with the addition of life-size AT-ATs In fact, we should really stop calling Star Wars Land a theme park — it's more of an immersive role-playing experience set on a specific frontier planet in that galaxy far, far away. Set to open in 2019, it's a place where your actions will have consequences. For example, you'll be able to go on a "ride" where you pilot the Millennium Falcon — but if you do a bad job, a certain hairy co-pilot might have some angry words for you when you visit a nearby cantina. Lucasfilm isn't ready to say what the supposed Outer Rim planet is called just yet; just that it is located on its official galactic atlas, has a rich and ancient history, a Morrocco-like look and feel, and it's not anywhere we've seen in the movies so far. Here's how the official Disney Parks blog puts it: The remote village was once a busy crossroads along the old sub-lightspeed trade routes, but the prominence of the outpost has been bypassed with the rise of hyperspace travel. Now home to those who prefer less attention, it has become a thriving port for smugglers, rogue traders and adventurers traveling between the frontier and uncharted space.

There will be lightsabers that look far more realistic than the cheap plastic variety. And multiple AT-ATs will tower over the village.
