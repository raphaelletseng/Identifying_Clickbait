Star Wars fans are probably still unsure what Carrie Fisher's death means for her role of General Leia in the franchise's future.

While it was known that Fisher had completed her scenes for upcoming instalment Episode VIII: The Last Jedi ahead of her passing, her brother Todd has revealed that he and Carrie's daughter Billie Lourd have given Disney their blessing to feature Fisher in Episode IX.

Todd told The New York Times: “Both of us were like, 'Yes, how do you take her out of it?' And the answer is you don't.

“She's as much a part of it as anything and I think her presence now is even more powerful than it was, like Obi Wan – when the saber cuts him down he becomes more powerful.

He added: ”I feel like that's what's happened with Carrie. I think the legacy should continue.“

For all of those worrying that Fisher will be reconstructed using CGI - in a similar way to Peter Cushing in prequel Rogue One - it's reported that Leia's appearance in Episode IX will be comprised of scenes she filmed for The Last Jedi.
