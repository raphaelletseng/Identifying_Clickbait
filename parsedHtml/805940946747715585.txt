Trans Activist Whose Epic Trump Rant Went Viral Speaks Out
Trans Activist Whose Epic Trump Rant Went Viral Speaks Out
The transgender activist who took Donald Trump to task in a series of viral tweets says she hopes her rant will inspire others, including Republicans, to speak out against the president-elect’s many lies and offenses toward minority groups, among other transgressions. The interplay began Saturday, when Trump blasted the most recent episode of “ Saturday Night Live ” on Twitter. Evidently, it was a Dec. 4 segment starring Alec Baldwin as a recklessly-tweeting Trump that incensed the notoriously thin-skinned president-elect, who called the show “unwatchable.” Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad Danielle Muscato , who deems herself an “atheist civil-rights activist, public speaker, debater, writer, columnist and pundit,” shot back, arguing that the president-elect was “embarrassing” himself in a tweet that’s since been retweeted over 22,000 times and liked by over 81,000 Twitter users. Jesus fucking Christ, @realDonaldTrump . You are the president-elect. Pick your fucking battles, man. You're embarrassing yourself. She continued: @realDonaldTrump Baldwin's impression isn't "Sad." You know what's sad? In 7 wks you'll be responsible for 330m lives & you can't think of @realDonaldTrump (cont) anything better to do than tweet abt a comedy show. You know that actual lives are at stake, right? You're pathetic. And the Missouri-based Muscato didn’t stop there. Over the next two hours, her rant extended to 30 tweets, all of which garnered thousands of likes and retweets. @realDonaldTrump This is not a joke, Donald. Don't you have anything better to do? Are you so narcissistic that a PARODY is your priority? @realDonaldTrump Do you know how many trans people were murdered since Election Day? Do you know how many veterans killed themselves? Muscato, who had 3,500 followers when she began tweeting at Trump early Sunday, now has over 90,000. She told The Huffington Post that the fact that Twitter users responded so fervently to her series of tweets was evidence of just how divided the country has become in the weeks since Trump swept to victory Nov. 8. “I think I’m hardly alone in that I’ve been terribly angry about the result of the election, especially considering the margin by which Hillary [Clinton] won the popular vote . But amazingly, things are turning out to be worse than I imagined,” Muscato said. “Trump ran for the wrong reasons, namely, enriching himself. He never wanted this job, and now that he has it, he’s hoping a ‘fake-it-til-you-make-it’ approach will be sufficient for the most powerful office in the world. He’s wrong, and it’s repulsive.” The response from fellow Twitter users and others has been overwhelming positive. “I’m absolutely thrilled that my message has resonated with so many people ― I think these things simply needed to be said, and I absolutely intend to use this platform to continue fighting for good,” she told HuffPost. Ultimately, she hopes the rant will inspire others to call out Trump “literally every time he says or proposes something that is unacceptable.” “Resistance, en masse, is our only hope,” she said. @realDonaldTrump Do you know how many children went to bed tonight without enough food to eat? Do you even care? What is *wrong* with you?! @realDonaldTrump No, of course you don't know those things. You don't even know what a "blind trust," and you call yourself a businessman. @realDonaldTrump You're pathetic. You ran for prez for attention. You are a fake,a fraud.

And it shows @realDonaldTrump You think we're all too polite, too aghast, to call you out. I see through you, Donny. I'm calling you out. You're a joke. @realDonaldTrump With every fiber of my being, I am disgusted by you. And you know what the real secret is? You're disgusted by you, too. @realDonaldTrump That's why you surround yourself with gold, and beautiful women that you objectify. You know you're a loser, so you try to @realDonaldTrump make yourself feel better, feel successful, authoritative, with things, and money. You are an impostor. You are a fraud. @realDonaldTrump I'm ashamed of you. The world is ashamed. You spout NONSENSE, millions of illegal voters?! Even you don't believe it—absurd @realDonaldTrump Do you think we're stupid? You think we don't know what you're doing? Trying to control the narrative, get your followers.. @realDonaldTrump ..to distrust the media, the polls, news reporters, so that they must turn to YOU for what's true, what's real? There's a @realDonaldTrump ..name for that. It's "propaganda." We know what you're doing.

WE WILL RESIST I call upon progressives, Democrats, independents AND Republicans to #RESIST  @realDonaldTrump . #RESIST fascism, crony capitalism, hypocrisy!
