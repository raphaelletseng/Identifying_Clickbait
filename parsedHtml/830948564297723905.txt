Solange Just Won Her First Grammy Ever
Beyoncé is no longer the only Grammy Award-winning Knowles out there. Solange Knowles won the Grammy for Best R&B Performance for her song “Cranes in the Sky” at the 59th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday. On Twitter, Solange expressed her gratitude for the award, and said if she was allowed to give a speech, she would have noted that black women “ARE grammys.” Thank you for your well wishes. Gratitude. If I would've gotten to accept this, I would've said black girls/women ARE grammys mothafuckaaaa🌹 pic.twitter.com/Pm1LncrIAo The song that earned Solange a statue was the single off of her 2016 album “ A Seat at the Table ,” which reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 last October, making it her first No. 1 album. Solange beat out Rihanna, Musiq Soulchild, Ro James and BJ The Chicago Kid for the award. It was her first Grammy award and nomination. Solange still has a ways to go before she catches her sister, Beyoncé, who earned nine nominations and is in the running for Album, Record and Song of the Year. But that doesn’t matter much right now. Let’s just appreciate that Solange is making her own name. Solange just won her first grammy for cranes in the sky. pic.twitter.com/jDgopfCjUK ALSO ON HUFFPOST Grammy Awards 2017 Red Carpet       Share this slide:       MORE:
