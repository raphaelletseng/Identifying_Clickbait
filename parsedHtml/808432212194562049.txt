CITI: These '12 Charts of Christmas' tell us a lot about what to expect in 2017


Market analysts are starting to wrap up their year's work and turning their attention to what will happen in 2017.

Citi's FX team, looking at the technical trading positions of a range of assets, has a note out with a dozen predictions, with some summary statements that helpfully line up with the tune of the seasonal favourite song "The 12 Days of Christmas."

An edited version of the slide deck from analysts Tom Fitzpatrick, Shyam Devani, Dan Tobon, and Beimnet Abebe is below. It's republished with kind permission, and their key calls include:

The S&P will continue to rise;

Oil is heading above $US60;

US consumer price inflation will head "close to 3%;"

US 10-year Treasury yields have the potential to bust out beyond 4%;

The US dollar will continue to strengthen;

The Euro will hit parity with the US dollar and potentially fall below that level, and,

The gold price will continue to fall.

It's a good summary of views on some major issues, delivered with some seasonal spirit and the odd gratuitous reference to technical trading terms such as channel bases. But anyone can read this and follow what they see flowing from the charts.
