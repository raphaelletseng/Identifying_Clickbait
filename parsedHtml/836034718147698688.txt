Oscars 2017 live: PWC apologise after La La Land-Moonlight Best Picture mistake: 'the presenters were given the wrong envelope'
Oscars 2017 live: PWC apologise after La La Land-Moonlight Best Picture mistake: 'the presenters were given the wrong envelope' 
Moonlight has won Best Picture - but only after La La Land was announced by mistake Who passed Warren Beatty the wrong envelope? What really happened when La La Land won over Moonlight Casey Affleck has won Best Actor and Emma Stone has won Best Actress Mahershala Ali has won Best Supporting Actor , Viola Davis has won Best Supporting Actress and Damien Chazelle has won Best Actor Oscars 2017: full list of winners Jimmy Kimmel skewers Donald Trump and shows support for 'overrated' Meryl Streep a La Land was announced as the best film winner at the 2017 Oscars on Sunday night - but then had to hand the award over to Moonlight after a mistake was noticed in what was the most dramatic moment in the history of the Academy Awards. In extraordinary scenes, the La La Land team were halfway through their victory speeches, when it was noticed that the wrong film name had been read out by Warren Beatty and that Moonlight was actually the winner. "There's a mistake. Moonlight, you won best picture," Fred Berger, the La La Land producer announced to the gasps of a shocked crowd. He held up the card clearly showing the winner was Moonlight. The stars and crew of La La Land shuffled off the stage and handed their gold statuettes to a jubilant Moonlight team. Beatty said he had been given the wrong envelope to open. "I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land," he said, adding he had not done it "to try to be funny". mma Stone said backstage: "I was holding my best actress card the whole time so whatever story you heard, I don't know what happened, but I wanted to tell you that." Casey Affleck won best actor for Manchester By The Sea while Stone won best actress and Damien Chazelle best director both for La La Land. Viola Davis and Mahershala Ali won supporting Oscars for Fences and Moonlight respectively. Auto update PriceWaterhouseCoopers: 'The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope' he accountants have wasted no time in releasing a statement, explaining that yes, the wrong envelope got into Beatty's hands: We sincerely apologise to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture. The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation. Moonlight director Barry Jenkins has been talking backstage ick Allen, our reporter in LA, has this on the disaster from victorious Moonlight director Barry Jenkins back stage: Barry Jenkins said he had been given "no explanation" so far by the Academy. "Things just happen," he said. "I wanted to see the card. Warren refused to show the card to anybody before he showed it to me. "He came and showed it to me. He said he had to show it to me and that made me feel better about what happened." The card said Moonlight but Mr Jenkins added: "There were two cards." He added: "The Lalaland folks were so gracious, I can't even imagine being in their postion and having to do that." He said what happened "made something very special  even more special but not in the way I expected. "The last 20 minutes of my life have been insane. I don't think my life could be changed in any more dramatic way. "Hot damn, we won best picture."  Tim Robey tries to make sense of it all scars? Meh. Booooring. La La Land, the hot favourite, won 7, just as everyone guessed. Any hope of a sneak upset was dashed when Faye Dunaway read out the… Wait. There’s confusion. Hold up a second. The wrong envelope? What? What just happened? What is Warren Beatty trying to explain just happened? Can this possibly be true? In a last-ditch twist so universally jaw-dropping that M. Night Shyamalan has already – quite genuinely – taken credit for it on Twitter, the actual winner of Best Picture was not La La Land at all. It was Moonlight. It took an incredible several minutes for this monumental screw-up to be witnessed, addressed and rectified. In this time, the poor La La Land producers had time to thank their agents, their wives, and everyone else in the room while we sat and yawned. Then one of them stepped in with big, urgent news. “This is not a joke,” he was forced to explain. “Moonlight won.” In came Beatty again. Suddenly it all made sense. He had stared inside the envelope in such bafflement, groping within in case it contained something he couldn’t initially find. It looked like he was horsing around, but he was clearly just confused. He was holding the one that said “Emma Stone, La La Land” inside it. And Faye Dunaway saw the last three words, and fatefully delivered them to the world. But Moonlight – truly the year’s *best* picture – was the title inside the envelope they should have been given. Moonlight! For it to win in this fashion was an insane coup, a heaven-sent miracle for the movie’s fans. We will pore over this footage for years, scrutinising every detail. The Oscars have never dealt a surprise like this, in 90 years, not once. Narrative drama in any format may have just peaked. And every jaw in Hollywood is still being scraped off the floor. Jimmy Kimmel: our verdict "Kimmel's hazing of Matt Damon all night has been the gift that keeps on giving," says our film critic Tim Robey. "Even amid more dubious skits, like the very divisive busload-of-tourists-rocking-up, he's had this to return to time and again. One minute Javier Bardem is extolling the gifts of peak Streep; the next Kimmel is getting misty-eyed over Damon in WE BOUGHT A ZOO??! No one could have seen that coming. Inspired." ere are the Mean Tweets.  Nick Allen has this from Emma Stone backstage mma Stone tells our man in LA: "I was holding my best actress card the whole time so whatever story you heard, I don't know what happened, but I wanted to tell you that.  I f------ love Moonlight. I think it's one of the best movies of all time. When it happened I was just on such a buzzy stage, I was already on another planet. I think it's a good outcome but a very strange happening for Oscar history." When Emma Stone realizes the twist ending #Oscars  #BestPicture  pic.twitter.com/nkm1nDLnmE tone, who *did* win an Oscar for La La Land, also says she's going to dance the night away. "I'm going to go out with a bunch of my friends and dance and drink champagne, that's my only plan. Its been surreal to play this woman. I've lived in LA for 13 years, I came here when I was 15 to audition. I knew what it felt like to go on audition after audition." Clutching her Oscar she adds: "I've been looking down at it like it was a newborn child, then I thought this is a naked man. Its creepy. How did that turn into a naked man story?" Viola Davis has been talking back stage he told our reporter in LA: "I grew up in apartments that were condemned and rat infested and I just wanted to be good at something. This is just like the miracle of God and dreaming big and hoping it sticks and lands, and it did. Who knew?" Twitter reacts nsurprisingly, Twitter has been quick to react to the embarrassing reversal, with a number of celebrities choosing to make topical jokes about the mess-up. You know what the problem is -- millions of Academy members voted illegally. Most nights, I have a dream in which what just happened at the #Oscars actually happened on election night. I wrote the ending of the academy awards 2017. @jimmykimmel we really got them!  Moonlight wins Best Picture -  but La La Land is announced by mistake n a jaw-dropping turn of events, the wrong winner for Best Picture was read out...and the error was only realised after Damien Chazelle and the La La Land team had taken to the stage. Beatty wasn't bullshitting. He was desperately looking for another card. He got handed the wrong envelope. pic.twitter.com/Efu8sICf8Y alfway through his acceptance speech, La La Land's producer Justin Hurwitz suddenly clocked that his film hadn't won: "Guys, I’m sorry, no, there’s a mistake" he said. "Moonlight, you guys won best picture. I’m going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight." Warren Beatty explained how the mistake happened: it looks like the actor was given the wrong envelope by mistake. "I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land - that’s why I took such a long look at you and Faye [Dunaway]," he told the audience. "I wasn’t trying to be funny."  Emma Stone wins Best Actress s many predicted, the La La Land star has claimed the Aacdemy Award for Best Actress. "To the women in this category – you were all so extraordinary and I look up to you and admire you," said Stone as she accepted her award. " It has been the greatest honour to stand alongside you. I realise a moment like this is a huge confluence of luck and opportunity so I want to thank Damien Chazelle to be given the opportunity. Ryan Gosling, thank you for making me laugh and always raising the bar and being the best partner on this crazy adventure. To all the people that worked on this movie, I’m going to find you all individually and I’m going to thank you. I’m going to hug the hell out of you when the feeling re-enters my body. I still have a lot of growing and learning to do, and this guy (the Oscar statue) is a really beautiful symbol of continuing to do that." Best Actress: our predictions Stone is a delight in general, and delightful in La La Land, and here’s an opportunity to appreciate everything she does so delightfully. It won’t feel like the most technically challenging work ever to win this prize, but making the hoofing look easy, in particular, is anything but. It’s glorious that Huppert is finally an Oscar nominee, and gasp-inducing that Elle was the vehicle to do it. She gives us a rape victim unlike any other the screen, or real life, has ever seen, and makes a brilliant case for responding exactly how she damn well chooses. Casey Affleck wins Best Actor n an emotional speech, the Manchester By The Sea star thanked the film's director Kenneth Lonergan and producer Matt Damon. Affleck also paid tribute to fellow Best Actor nominee Denzel Washington. "It means so much to me thank you. One of the first people who taught me how to act was Denzel Washington and I just met him for the first time tonight. I’m only here because of all the talent and goodwill of so many people impossible to name. Man, I wish I had something and more meaningful to say, but I’m really honoured to be part of this movie," he added. That reaction shot though! pic.twitter.com/rvkNsfDJs0  Best Actor is up next - here are our predictions Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea). Denzel Washington, who won the SAG award for Fences, is neck-and-neck, but Affleck’s unforgettably soul-sick performance should just about edge it, emboldening voters to look past the sex-assault charges that have mired his campaign in controversy. : Casey Affleck. Going just by the work on screen, this really ought to be Affleck’s moment. He masters not only the emotional payload of Manchester but its whole mood, one of six-feet-under self-recrimination and grief suppressed, never conquered. Damien Chazelle wins Best Director "This was a movie about love, and I was lucky enough to fall in love while making it," Chazelle said at the end of his speech as he thanked his partner, Olivia Hamilton. hazelle may have won, but our critic Tim Robey is adamant the award should have gone to Barry Jenkins for Moonlight: "Wildly acclaimed for his second feature, Jenkins feels like the more mature talent," he says, "and the most heartening success story of the season. There’s not an ounce of bloat to Moonlight, which balances its searing performances and woozily intoxicating visual style like a dream." Best Director is up next... hould Damien Chazelle win best director for La La Land - and let's face it, he probably will - he'll become the youngest ever winner in that category (he's 32). Here's a picture of him (with La La Land stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling) being sickeningly young.  Moonlight wins Best Adapted Screenplay arry Jenkins completely rewrote Tarell Alvin McCraney's play  In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue to create Moonlight. With its masterful economy and tender character-building, it's  a deserving winner. "To all the black and brown boys and girls and non-gender conforming,...this is for you," said Jenkins in his speech. Manchester By The Sea wins Best Original screenplay n his acceptance speech, Kenneth Lonergan, who is both the writer and director of Manchester By The Sea, spoke movingly about his own family and paid tribute to his mother, his late father, and his stepfather. He also thanked Manchester By The Sea producer Matt Damon. "I love movies, I love being part of movies. Thank you Matt Damon, the whole thing started with you," the director said. Best Original Screenplay is up next - and here are our predictions It’s a photo-finish here with La La Land, as in most of the races, but if there’s one award Damien Chazelle might personally be prepared to lose, it should probably be this one. It feels like a natural opportunity to reward Lonergan for his beautifully structured writing on Manchester, which would otherwise only be taking home a sole acting award, if that. No slight to the thoroughly deserving Lonergan, but there’s an even better script in contention here – and it’s the only nomination in sight for Mills’s gloriously witty, capacious character study, which missed out on Best Actress consideration for Annette Bening. It doesn’t have a chance of winning in a million years, but let’s not forget all about it. The In Memoriam was quietly devasating he Oscars’ annual In Memoriam reel is always an emotional interlude, but this year’s was a 15-hankie wipe-out, soundtracked by Sara Bareilles. Carrie Fisher, Prince, Debbie Reynolds, John Hurt, Gene Wilder, Mary Tyler Moore and Anton Yelchin were among the many stars and filmmakers whose talents were commemorated. Sadly, Bill Paxton, whose death at the age of 61 was announced on Sunday, wasn't included. Alan Rickman and David Bowie, both of whom died in January last year, were remembered at the 2016 ceremony. La La Land's City of Stars wins Best Original Song nd rightly so, we reckon: it's a stirringly beautiful piece of music. Samuel L Jackson presents the Academy Award for Best Original Score to La La Land's Justin Hurtwitz n his speech, Hurtwitz thanked "all the LA musicians" who brought his music to life. "Thanks to the LA musicians who worked on the film. I just put notes on the page - they’re the ones who made it sound beautiful," he said. "This film was made with so much love, passion and struggles and it was all thanks to you, Damien," he added, addressing the film's director Damien Chazelle. "You’re a poetic genius and I’m so happy I met you and I really love you man. Emma, Ryan, I think you’re incredible, thanks for all the collaboration." Best Original Score is coming up next..here are our predictions If everyone’s favourite Oscar-friendly musical doesn’t win for its music, it’ll come as something of a shock. Hurwitz, a contemporary and old Harvard buddy of his director’s, certainly composed a couple of earworms here which even non-La La Land fans might find themselves idly whistling in the bathroom, before catching themselves and cursing. Still, 29-year-old Levi ought to be romping home with this. After giving Scarlett Johansson’s alien predator an unforgettable siren call in Under the Skin, she delves with disorienting verve into Jackie Kennedy’s fractured psyche – her downward-sliding string motifs, dropping an octave, are a stunning effective foundation for what the whole film is doing.

This means Suicide Squad will always have more Oscars than Scorsese's apparent masterpiece* Silence. * snore-fest The Best Cinematography award is up next... ill win: Linus Sandgren (La La Land) La La Land is spick and span, all right – those primary colours pop against the blue night sky, and Sandgren had to orchestrate some splashy long takes like that highway number at the start. The Swedish d.p., who shot David O. Russell’s American Hustle and Joy, looks poised to ride a La La Land semi-sweep and win here from his first nomination. Should win: James Laxton (Moonlight) Any other year, Arrival’s Bradford Young, or indeed Rodrigo Prieto, achieving Silence’s sole nomination, would seem like the geniuses in the room. But Laxton’s astonishing work makes those palm trees and lapping waves a textural backdrop that only Miami could provide. His hypnotic close-ups, meanwhile, frame every face like a religious portrait. Jimmy Kimmel tweets Donald Trump n an unpresidented turn of events, the US president is staying very quiet.

The White Helmets wins best documentary short alma Hayek and David Oyelowo have given the award to another film affected by the travel ban: Syrian cinematographer Khaled Khateeb was denied entry to the US so couldn’t attend.

Just didn't suspect it would come from Michael J Fox and Seth Rogan.  Hacksaw Ridge claims second Oscar of the night, for Film Editing a La Land, in contrast, is losing, badly in the technical categories. It's now missed out in at least three of the categories everyone was widely predicting it would win, and has only claimed one award so far...   The Jungle Book wins the Academy Award for Achievement in Visual Effects on Favreau's dark update of the beloved 1967 Disney classic swapped hand-drawn animation for fearsome CGI animals. The Telegraph's Robbie Collin was particularly impressed by the menacing tiger Shere Khan. He wrote: "Khan, who’s voiced by Idris Elba, is a wholly computer-animated creation. But he’s realised in such extraordinarily hair-perfect detail, and moves with such persuasive physicality and weight, he might as well be the real, red-in-tooth-and-claw deal."

Zootopia wins best animated feature e loved Zootopia - it's hilarious, smart, allegorical - but Laika's stunning, meticulously crafted stop-motion epic Kubo and the Two Strings is simply life-affirming. Would have loved to see that triumph.  Disney-Pixar's Piper wins best animated short film e've not seen Piper...but, based on this trailer, it looks pretty great:  Sorry: we just drifted off for a minute ting just sang a song from the unflinching documentary Jim: The James Foley Story. It's OK, I guess. Bit booorrrrrrrringgggggggggggggg. Oops, fell asleep. Back with you now. Has a new Oscars record been set? Already, this Oscar telecast has featured 3 black winners. If one more wins, that will set an all-time record.  Best Foreign Language Film goes to The Salesman t's arguably the night's most politically charged moment yet: the film's director, Asghar Farhadi, is boycotting the Oscars due to Donald Trump's "inhuman"  Muslim travel ban. The Salesman was screened earlier tonight in London, to a crowd of 100,000 protesters. "It's a great honour to be receiving this valuable award for the second time," said Farhadi in a prepared statement , read out on his behalf. "I'm sorry I'm not with you tonight, my absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of the other six countries who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans immigrants from seven countries to the US." The Salesman probably wouldn't have won this Oscar without the travel ban – the original favourite was Toni Erdmann – but Farhadi's words as a write-in winner resonated hugely: especially on a night where most winners are being coyer than expected in their speeches. Still, trust Gael Garcia Bernal, introducing an award, to pull off a comment about migrants and seem like a cheeky scamp straight afterwards. "As a Mexican and a human being, I'm against any kind of wall that wants to separate us," he said.  Mark Rylance presents the Best Supporting Actress Award to Viola Davis ark Rylance, introducing the Best Supporting Actress award, praised women saying they were were better than men at "opposing without hatred". In an emotional speech, Davis said: "There’s one place where all the people with the greatest potential are gathered and that’s the graveyard. I say exhume those bodies - exhume the stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those come to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. We’re the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. She also thanked her parents: "Thank you for teaching me how to fail, how to love, how to hold an award, how to lose – I’m so thankful that God chose you to bring me into this world." oving as her words were, Telegraph film critic Tim Robey was less than impressed, "Viola's speech was *so* over-rehearsed," he says. "God love her, but it shouldn't require so much acting! " Best Supporting Actress is up soon...here are our predictions The only slam-dunk win in the four acting fields is Davis, who has the narrowest odds of anyone since Colin Firth in The King’s Speech. It’s a make-up Oscar, in part – she lost in a nail-biter to Meryl Streep six years ago – and in part just straightforward recognition for the serious depths she plumbs in every dramatic role. We’ll certainly go with Davis, because her slow-burn indignation as Rose Maxson throughout Fences is tremendous, even if she really earned a shot at Best Actress honours – and would surely have won there, too. Everyone else in her field, despite great scenes here and there, is an also-ran, on this occasion. Hacksaw Ridge wins Best Sound Mixing - meaning that La La Land won't be setting any new records amien Chazelle's  musical won't now beat the previous record (of 11 wins) set by Titanic, Ben-Hur and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The win is good news for its recipient Kevin O'Connell, however: he's been nominated 20 times before, essentially making him the Leonardo DiCaprio of the sound mixing world. Arrival wins its first Oscar: Best Sound Editing his means that La La Land, if it doesn't win in the next category it's nominated in, won't be breaking any new records. The Rock introduces Lin Manuel-Miranda and Auli’i Cravalho wayne Johnson, aka The Rock, just introduced Lin Manuel-Miranda and Auli’i Cravalho to perform How Far I’ll Go from Moana. It’s the second nominated song to be performed tonight (following Justin Timberlake's rendition of Can’t Stop the Feeling during the opening). "Our next presenter is an ex-wrestler who is the highest paid actor in the world, which really puts all this into perspective doesn't it?" said Kimmel ahead of Johnson's appearance. Twitter, meanwhile, just can't get enough of The Rock's velvet suit: #DwayneJohnson in a velvet suit... pic.twitter.com/w41hFLV3ty Dwayne Johnson is the only dude who can wear a velvet suit and not look ridiculous Dwayne Johnson in that velvet suit, yesssss. #Oscars  Nasa's Katherine Johnson, one of the three female African-American scientists portrayed in Hidden Figures, presents the best Documentary Award to O.J.: Made in America Katherine Johnson @akasorority1908 former NASA mathematician, graces @oscar2017lives .

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them wins Best Costume Design e thought there was a chance La La Land would nab it's first Oscar in this category, but Fantastic Beasts is a worthy winner.  Suicide Squad is now an Oscar-winning movie rue, it's for best hair and make-up.  But let's not quibble over the details. "Suicide Squad" has now won more Oscars than "Singin' In The Rain", "Vertigo" and "The Shawshank Redemption" added together. pic.twitter.com/5XC4o2faej  Kimmel's opening monologue: Telegraph film critic Tim Robey's verdict fter the unambiguous joy explosion of Justin Timberlake's opening musical number, Jimmy Kimmel's monologue started out feeling like a bumpier ride: it made an early grab for political relevance, including an unironic plea to make America great again, which didn't really play. But a bag of big laughs awaited as it went on. "This year, black people saved NASA and white people saved jazz." And how about Donald Trump's Twitter response? "All caps during his 5am bowel movement". The joke about Streep being “overrated” led to a massive round of applause (a reference to Trump's claim). “Meryl Streep has phoned it in for over 50 films” joked the comedian. Kimmel absolutely killed it. The Best Supporting Actor Award goes to Mahershala Ali t's the Moonlight star's first Oscar nomination. "I wanna thank my teachers and professors," he said.  "I had so many wonderful teachers, and one thing they consistently told me was that it's not about you, it's about these characters. You're a servant, you're in service to these stories and these characters. "I'm so blessed to have had an opportunity. It was such a wonderful experience, thank you [director] Barry Jenkins, thank you Tarell Alvin McCraney [writer of the play Moonlight was based on]. I also want to thank my wife, we just had our daughter four days ago, so I just want to thank her for being such a soldier through this process and really carrying me through it all. Thank you, peace and blessings." Mahershala Ali is the first Muslim actor to win an Oscar and, while it's sad that it took this long, what a perfect year for it to happen.  'When I first met Matt, I was the fat one': Jimmy Kimmel begins his roast n his opening speech, Kimmel joked about Damon's latest movie, the very expensive flop The Great Wall. He also thanked US President Donald Trump - This time last year, the Oscars looked racist..." - and joked about Trump's controversial travel ban. "We don't discriminate against people based on where they come from,2 he said. "We discriminate against them based on their age and weight." Best Supporting Actor should be up soon... ere are our predictions: Will win: Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) This entire category could have been filled with the Moonlight cast, but it’s Ali’s modestly-scaled turn as a compassionate drug dealer – plus a terrific year for him all round – that has gotten the push. It’s rare that such nuanced, unflashy work has resulted in a front-runner nomination, but everyone looks fully happy to embrace it. hould win: Mahershala Ali Hedges, Bridges, Shannon and Patel make this the strongest Best Supporting Actor field in years, even if three of them have roughly triple Ali’s screen time. You can see strong arguments for all five. But to make the deep impression Ali does with his handful of scenes, inviting us into his film’s whole milieu with such confident restraint, puts him a head in front.  We're about to get underway... he suspense mounts in an Oscar race that isn't as locked down as it once looked. Best Actor is neck and neck. A shock in Best Actress isn't impossible. And could La La Land potentially lose Best Picture to Moonlight? These questions should certainly keep the night lively, even if predictability will reign for long stretches: there's no way Viola Davis isn't taking an Oscar home, and absolutely no doubt that she deserves one. Perhaps the greatest moment-to-moment tension will be in the speeches; even without Meryl Streep adding to her trophy tally, you can guarantee the Trump gibes will proliferate like confetti. Arrival star Jeremy Renner brings some much-needed glamour to the red carpet t wouldn't be a red carpet without Jeremy Renner.  Matt Damon is ready for a roasting amon has been speaking about Casey Affleck, who's nominated for Best Actor for Manchester By the Sea. "I'm so proud of him," he says, giving Affleck some much-needed positive PR. "I've known him since he was five years old, and he's one of the best people I know." Asked about his friend Jimmy Kimmel's plans to roast him tonight, Damon said: "He's talentless himself, but he's got an incredible group of writers around him. I'm in for it tonight."  Ryan Gosling says La La Land reaction has been a 'nice surprise' "We had no idea that it would have this type of reception. It's been a nice surprise," the actor said on the red carpet. ere's  a picture of Gosling at the Oscars tonight, thinking about nice surprises:  Andrew Garfield: 'Mel Gibson is a great man' ick Allen has had a quick word with the only British hope for Best Actor Andrew Garfield: "It's lovely I can't believe this is happening it's so special," Garfield said. He then showered praise on his Hacksaw Ridge director Mel Gibson. "I think he's one of our great filmmakers and just a great man."

Her hair and make-up nail the vibe though; she's channeling old Hollywood glamour with her waves and rich red lip. We can just see the Marlene Dietrich and Veronica Lake photos on that moodboard. Best Supporting Actor nominee Dev Patel has brought his mother along, and she looks ridiculously, heart-warmingly proud of him o be fair, I'd be ridiculously, heart-warmingly proud if Best Supporting Actor Dev Patel was my son. Dev Patel is great. Dear future children: none of you will ever be as good as Dev Patel. Sorry. ere are some slightly more sensible words about Dev Patel: Dev Patel, arriving with his mum, is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his work in Lion - even though he is DEFINITELY the lead in that film. At the Baftas, Mahershala Ali was the firm favourite for playing drug dealer Juan in Moonlight, but Patel’s complex emotional journey in the film, coupled with serious newly minted leading-man magnetism obviously struck a chord with the Bafta membership, and he took home the award. Will a similar upset happen tonight? "It is very overwhelming moment for both of us," said Patel, when asked about brining his mother. "The reason I became an actor is through her vision. This film is about mothers and sons. She is more deserving to be here than me."

La La Land was announced as the best film winner at the 2017 Oscars on Sunday night - but then had to hand the award over to Moonlight after a mistake was noticed in what was the most dramatic moment in the history of the Academy Awards.

In extraordinary scenes, the La La Land team were halfway through their victory speeches, when it was noticed that the wrong film name had been read out by Warren Beatty and that Moonlight was actually the winner.

"There's a mistake. Moonlight, you won best picture," Fred Berger, the La La Land producer announced to the gasps of a shocked crowd. He held up the card clearly showing the winner was Moonlight.

The stars and crew of La La Land shuffled off the stage and handed their gold statuettes to a jubilant Moonlight team.

Beatty said he had been given the wrong envelope to open. "I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land," he said, adding he had not done it "to try to be funny".
