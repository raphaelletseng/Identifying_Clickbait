College Student Suffers Severe Reaction After Hazing Involving Peanut Butter
A Michigan college student with a deadly peanut allergy was the victim of a hazing ritual in which he was daubed in the face with peanut butter at an off-campus party, spurring a severe reaction that left him with swollen eyes, officials and the man’s mother said. The police in Mount Pleasant, Mich., said they were investigating the October encounter involving youths who said they were members of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity at Central Michigan University and the student, Andrew Seely, 19. Law enforcement authorities and university officials found out about the hazing this week, after Mr. Seely’s mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about it and posted a photograph of her son’s distorted face on Facebook . “He could have been killed,” she wrote, adding that he carried medicine to counteract accidental exposure to peanuts. “We will be investigating,” Capt. Andy Latham of the Mount Pleasant Police said by telephone. He added that the authorities had not yet spoken to Mr. Seely, who transferred to another school, but that they were contacted on Wednesday by the family’s lawyer.

When he came to, she said, he discovered that his eyes, nose and lips had ballooned because peanut butter had been rubbed on his face. Advertisement Ms. Seely said he was treated at a campus clinic. He told his family only this week about the hazing, she said, after which she called the campus police, the Mount Pleasant police and university officials. Ms. Seely could not be reached by telephone on Friday. Heather Smith, a spokeswoman for the university, said the fraternity had not been active on campus since 2011 because of previous hazing. She said campus officials heard about Mr. Seely’s experience through his mother’s social media post.

We didn’t know he was allergic,” the member said. “We were not trying to harm him in any sense.” Officials have been trying to stamp out the kind of campus activities and rituals that lead to Mr. Seely’s allergy attack, as university and high school students find disturbingly creative ways to haze others.

According to a chronology of cases kept by Hank Nuwer, a journalism professor at Franklin College in Indiana, there has been at least one hazing death every year from 1969 to 2016 at United States colleges and high schools. “I would say there are thousands of hazings every day, most of which are not reported,” said Susan Lipkins, a psychologist and expert on the practice. “And each year hazing gets worse.

She said she had no direct knowledge of Mr. Seely’s case, but believed it was most likely that the group had advance knowledge that he had an allergy. “It is not a typical hazing activity,” she said. “Of all the hazing activities, I have not heard of peanut butter on the face.” In 2012, a 26-year-old drum major died after a brutal hazing ritual at Florida A&M University in which he was pummeled with hands, drumsticks, bass drum mallets, straps and even an orange cone by at least 15 band members on a bus. The cause of death was “hemorrhagic shock caused by blunt-force trauma,” the medical examiner said. We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
