Chrisette Michele is learning that lesson now; even her open letter regarding her performance is catching heat on the internets, and the situation has pissed off one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, Spike Lee. Lee took to Instagram (which he is wont to do when something is on his mind) to confirm that while he was planning on using Chrisette Michele's 2016 song "Black Girl Magic" for his upcoming Netflix original series (which is an adaptation of his 1986 film). Good Morning Folks. I Wuz Sorry To Read That "Sistuh Girl" Is Singin' At DT's Inauguration (And To Use His Fav Word-SAD). I Wuz Thinkin' 'bout Using Chrisette's Song- BLACK GIRL MAGIC In My Netflix Series SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT.... NOT ANYMORE. And Dat's Da Truth, Ruth.
