Nestlé announced proposals to move production of the iconic Blue Riband chocolate bar from the UK to Poland resulting in around 300 job losses, primarily in York and Newcastle

GMB and Unite unions slammed the company for the move.

Tim Roache, GMB General Secretary, said: “To shift the production of an iconic British brand like Blue Riband to Poland is completely unacceptable.

“Nestle are throwing people’s lives, and those of their families, into turmoil for the sake of increasing profit margins.

“These factories should be exporting chocolate – not people’s jobs.

“The Government needs to step in before it’s too late – and reassure millions of workers across the country this is not just the tip of the Brexit iceberg.”

Nestlé said the proposals would be subject to a 45-day consultations.

These proposals span four different sites: York, Fawdon, Halifax and Girvan, with job losses predominantly to hit York and Fawdon, through 2017 and 2018.

The company said it expected that these would be achieved through voluntary redundancies.

The proposed changes include amended and standardised shift patterns at each factory and, at Fawdon, the most complex of Nestlé’s UK confectionery sites, the transfer of Blue Riband production to a Nestlé factory in Poland. This would mean being able to “simplify and focus Fawdon’s operation”, the company said

These proposals are being made by Nestlé UK to ensure that these sites operate more efficiently and remain competitive in a rapidly changing external environment.=

The company said: “Nestlé UK appreciates that this is an uncertain time for employees and will work hard to ensure all are supported through this difficult period.”
