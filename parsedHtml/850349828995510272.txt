Here's a list of the best-selling beers in the world


The most popular beer on the planet is one you may neverÂ have even heard of.Â That's because sales of it areÂ almost exclusively limited to one country: China.

Sales of the world's best-selling beer, Snow, haveÂ grown 573% over the past decade, according to Bloomberg. But despite its popularity in China, it's available only at specialty retailers in the US.

This 4% lager is extremely cheap and sells at around $1 per liter in China, according to Quartz.

The world's second most popular beer, Tsingtao,Â was introduced into the US in 1972 andÂ has becomeÂ the highest-selling Chinese beer in the country.

The popular American brew Bud Light comes in third place.Â
