The opinions expressed are those of the writer. A big bet by California philanthropists David and Dana Dornsife is helping World Vision to supply clean water and sanitation to rural Africans. Above, World Vision staff work to drill a well in rural Ethiopia. (Photo credit: Jon Warren/World Vision) David Dornsife recalls the first time he took his wife, Dana, to see the work they were funding to provide water to people in Africa, traveling to a village with no wells in Ghana in 2001. "People had scabies all over their faces," he says. "It was hard to talk with them because there were flies everywhere." The average life span, they learned, was 46 years; 40% of the village was going blind from a bacterial infection called trachoma; and nearly 10% had contracted a debilitating parasite called guinea worm, which lives in dirty water. Even for the relatively healthy, water dominated their lives. Women and children spent up to seven hours a day fetching and ferrying it in 40-pound jerry cans balanced on their heads. And this village was nothing special: Some 385 million rural Africans lack access to clean water. Around the world nearly 1,000 children under age 5 die every day as a result of diarrhea caused by contaminated water or poor sanitation. The Dornsifes then visited a village that had a well and latrines. "Once you provide water in the village, you turn a switch," says Dave, now 72. Adds Dana, 55: "The people are vibrant. Their children are in school, and their clothing is clean." Freed from the nearly full-time chore of procuring water, the women grew vegetables or formed co-ops, where one perhaps raised chickens and gathered eggs while a partner watched the children. That trip eventually led to an epiphany. Dave Dornsife, who owns a steel fabrication firm, had been donating to World Vision, a U.S.-based humanitarian organization, for three decades. What would happen if he put major money toward that specific scourge--lack of water access--on that specific continent? So in 2010 the Dornsifes committed $35 million to World Vision, over five years, to get water and sanitation and teach hygiene to 7.5 million people in ten African countries. In 2015 they doubled down with another $40 million and the goal of ensuring that every rural African in the 25 countries where World Vision works has access to water by 2030. That would be a huge achievement. In philanthropic parlance, the Dornsifes' $75 million investment through World Vision is a "big bet": an-eight-figure-or-more attempt to create systemic social change. Such wagers aren't new. The civil rights movement, the fertilizer-driven increase in crop yields, charter schools--all were fueled in part by a handful of visionary philanthropists. But increasingly, modern philanthropists, who have used disruptive thinking to create fortunes at ever younger ages, are more inclined to use their money to try to actually solve problems rather than salve wounds, and more foundations have embraced that approach, too. In 2015 alone, the Boston-based philanthropy consultant Bridgespan Group noted 58 philanthropic gifts of $25 million or more centered on solving a large-scale social problem. Sixteen years ago there were just 19. So does investing a lot in a moon shot provide a higher social ROI than spreading your chips around? To try to answer that question, FORBES partnered with Bridgespan to focus on 30 big gifts of 2015 aimed at social change. We then developed an evaluation methodology rooted in ambition, clarity and potential. From there we solicited ten outside advisors--some working in philanthropy, others in public policy or academia--to rank the ten most promising philanthropic bets (see below). There's Mike Bloomberg's $30 million plan to quickly retire half of America's coal-burning plants and the Rockefeller Foundation's $75 million to electrify rural India. And there's $50 million to provide college grants to undocumented "Dreamers" in the U.S., who might not otherwise be able to get a college degree. The consistent benefit: These bets free the recipient to focus on actual problem-solving. "Most of the nonprofit sector leaders and their teams have a constant tension between raising resources and focusing on programmatic excellence," says Dan Cardinali, the CEO of Independent Sector, a coalition of nonprofits, foundations and corporate giving programs, who also served on the Big Bets judging panel. Getting a large donation spread over several years "unleashes the leadership team to lean in and face some of the more intractable social problems." Big bets, in other words, can test a thesis rather than just cover a budget. The downside of big bet philanthropy can be summarized in two words: Mark Zuckerberg. In 2010 the Facebook founder, still in his 20s, committed $100 million over five years to improve the struggling schools of Newark, New Jersey. He did so on Oprah's TV show, crowing to the cheering studio audience that his goal was to "turn Newark into a symbol of educational excellence for the whole nation." That goal is no closer than it was when Zuckerberg made the pledge, the kind of humiliation that would presumably drive most funders to stick with big checks for local art-museum galas. But risk is inherent in big bet philanthropy. "We must take risks today to learn lessons for tomorrow," Zuckerberg wrote in an open letter to his newborn daughter in December 2015. He and his wife's year-old philanthropic venture, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, has committed 99% of Zuckerberg's Facebook stock, worth roughly $50 billion today, though they've created the vehicle in a way that allows them to invest in both for-profit and nonprofit entities. Their first big public declaration is the biggest moon shot of all: to cure all disease. Rather than shrink from his Newark failure, Zuckerberg seems to have been inspired by it. In terms of cash outlay, Bill and Melinda Gates may have underwritten one of the biggest philanthropic losses ever. Their $650 million focus on reducing school size resulted in a startling conclusion: School size had very little to do with student outcome. Money wasted? Not how they see it. "Warren [Buffett] always says you have to swing for the fences," Melinda told FORBES last year. Basically, that big bet, in taking an idea to its full conclusion, had great social value. Countless school districts have presumably reallocated money toward the outcome that does move the needle: teacher excellence. As with any good portfolio, the Gateses have wins that mitigate the losses, notably the $755 million they've funneled through the Rotary Foundation that has wiped out polio in all but three countries and provided the glimmer of a finish line in those places as well. Tellingly, the Gateses have two of the top three big bets, by our measurement, led by their $1.55 billion bet, through the Gavi alliance, to vaccinate 300 million children by 2020. Heady stuff, but it still represents a fraction of philanthropic giving, even at the $25 million-and-up levels (more than 100 of the grants in 2015 went to academic or cultural institutions). Bridgespan has found that 80% of philanthropists want to give away their wealth in a way that creates positive social change, but only 20% of their gifts go toward that end. "One factor is that this is risky and abnormal behavior," says Bridgespan's William Foster. The second barrier: finding opportunities. "It's harder than calling up your alma mater," he says. "You may not know where to go." David Dornsife, whose World Vision efforts came in at No. 5 on our list, knew exactly where to go when he and Dana were ready to make a big pledge. A longtime Bay Area resident, he is the son of a successful entrepreneur. His father, Harold, owned a bus manufacturer, Gillig Corp., and had begun buying a Bay Area steel fabrication company, Herrick Corp., from the founding Herrick family, a company Dave finished buying and now owns. Dave has supported World Vision's work since the mid-1980s, when he and others at his Presbyterian church began giving $24 a month to support a child in Africa. Water Warriors: David and Dana Dornsife at their home in the San Francisco Bay Area. They travel to Africa nearly every year with World Vision to see their donation in action. (Photo credit: Christian Peacock for Forbes) A few years into it he volunteered to go to Nairobi to see how the Kenyan children were being helped and report back to fellow church members. The work intrigued him. He asked what other projects he could support, and he began visiting World Vision projects in Africa for two weeks nearly every year; he's made 34 trips so far. By 2010, when the Dornsifes decided to give World Vision $35 million, they had come to know the organization and its leadership well. "We knew what worked and what didn't," says Dana. "I'd say it was a calculated risk." That long-term relationship between the donor and the recipient organization was one of six specific criteria the advisors used to rank the most promising bets. The Dornsifes got the highest score possible on the donor-grantee relationship. They also got high marks on both the clarity of the desired results and the degree of realism in the strategy. Greg Allgood, World Vision's vice president of water, gushes about how the funding from the Dornsifes--which the couple stipulated must be matched by other donations--enables the nonprofit to work more deeply and thus more efficiently. "We have a plan to go county by county, district by district," he says, as opposed to drilling a few wells across a bigger swath of each country. One 23,000-person district in Zambia is fully supplied with wells and latrines; 25 of the 38 districts in Zambia where World Vision works will have clean water in the next five years, Allgood predicts. Though not easy to measure, passion for a big bet is a must-have trait--something the Dornsifes exude when they talk about their work. "When you get our money, you get the Dornsifes," Dave says. John Fry, the president of Drexel University (Dana's alma mater, to which the couple have donated $58 million), accompanied them on a trip to Ethiopia in 2013. "As we got to one village there was a group of guys operating the drill rig. Dave climbs into the rig and was treated to 45 minutes of them showing him service logs. They have such pride in their work," Fry recalls. "And Dave had this big smile on his face, listening to them." Due diligence and altruism in one fell swoop--the kind of combination that turns a philanthropic big bet into an ROI for the world. Who's going big to change the world? Here are the ten most promising big bets. For the superrich and the biggest U.S. charitable foundations, donating to universities, hospitals and cultural institutions is the norm. Less common are donations targeted at "social change"--alleviating poverty, increasing employment and the like, though such donations are on the rise. Philanthropy consulting firm Bridgespan Group researched social-change gifts of $25 million or more that were announced last year. Ten outside experts ranked them based on six categories: ambition, clarity of desired results, whether the bet offers a clear role for philanthropy to "move the needle," whether the strategies are logical and realistic, the extent to which learning and improvement are built into the grant, and the strength of the relationship between the donor and the recipient organization. The maximum possible score was 18. It will be years before we know which bets actually succeed, but these are the ones worth paying the most attention to. 1. $1.55 BILLION TO Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance TOTAL SCORE: 17.4 In addition to funds from the Gates Foundation, other donors, including the government of Norway, pledged an additional $6 billion. Gavi aims to vaccinate 300 million children for a variety of diseases by 2020. 2. $30 MILLION TO The Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign TOTAL SCORE: 16.2 Former New York City mayor Bloomberg's foundation made the gift to help retire coal-burning power plants in the U.S. Twelve more funders pledged an additional combined $30 million. It will encourage regulators to crack down on pollution. 2. $120 MILLION TO Family Planning 2020 TOTAL SCORE: 16.2 Their foundation is backing Family Planning 2020, a public-private partnership that aims to provide 120 million women access to effective contraception by 2020 in an effort to reduce unplanned births, abortions, miscarriages and maternal deaths. 4. $50 MILLION TO TheDream.US TOTAL SCORE: 15.9 TheDream.US is a scholarship fund for undocumented U.S. college students who are eligible for temporary residency under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive order. The grant will provide some 5,000 students with scholarships to obtain degrees at 70 partner colleges. 5. $40 MILLION TO World Vision TOTAL SCORE: 15.6 The five-year grant will help World Vision provide clean water, sanitation and hygiene training to approximately 11 million people in 25 African countries, and help reduce the deaths resulting from unclean water. Children under 5 die at a rate of 1,000 a day around the world from diarrhea. 6. $42 MILLION TO What Works Cities TOTAL SCORE: 15.3 Bloomberg's foundation launched What Works Cities, a three-year initiative to help 100 U.S. cities to better use data and evidence for budgeting and decision making, and to fund "what works" at a time when cities have limited resources. 7. $75 MILLION TO The Safety and Justice Challenge TOTAL SCORE: 15.1 Over five years the foundation aims to reduce incarceration in jails by funding 20 jurisdictions in the U.S. that won a competition to implement plans they designed for fairer, more effective local justice systems. 8. $50 MILLION TO The United Negro College Fund's Career Pathways Initiative TOTAL SCORE: 15.0 The gift funds the Career Pathways Initiative; it awards grants to historically black colleges and universities and predominantly black institutions to help students gain skills needed in the workforce. 9. $75 MILLION TO Smart Power for Rural Development TOTAL SCORE: 14.9 The foundation created a new organization, Smart Power India, in 2015 to promote economic development in rural areas of India by providing access to energy from renewable sources to 1,000 villages over three years, reaching 1 million people. 10. $34 MILLION TO The ClimateWorks Foundation TOTAL SCORE: 14.0 The gift broadly funds ClimateWorks, which makes grants to support public policy, education and private sector collaboration with a focus on transitioning toward a low-carbon society. *Note: Patty Stonesifer was CEO of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation until 2008; she recused herself fromÂ weighing in on any grants that she had worked on while at the foundation. The Bridgespan Group identified all U.S. donorsâ€™ publicly announced 2015 gifts of $25 million and higher that it could find using a range of sources and outreach. It included bets pledged in 2015, rather than fulfillments ofÂ prior commitments. Internal Bridgespan field experts, using a rubric it designed and research, narrowed the nearly 60 bets found to the 30 most promising. The assembled external Advisory Board then rated these 30 against six characteristics ( and also provided qualitative assessments. We limited each funder to only two spots in the top 10 (otherwise The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies would have merited more mentions). The top 10 list spans nine funders and seven issue areas around the globe. The Bridgespan Group also has additional information about big bets here .    Trending on {{channel_name}}

METHODOLOGY

The Bridgespan Group identified all U.S. donorsâ€™ publicly announced 2015 gifts of $25 million and higher that it could find using a range of sources and outreach. It included bets pledged in 2015, rather than fulfillments of prior commitments. Internal Bridgespan field experts, using a rubric it designed and research, narrowed the nearly 60 bets found to the 30 most promising. The assembled external Advisory Board then rated these 30 against six characteristics (ambition, clarity of desired results, whether the bet offers a clear role for philanthropy to "move the needle," whether the strategies are logical and realistic, the extent to which learning and improvement are built into the grant, and the strength of the relationship between the donor and the recipient organization) and also provided qualitative assessments. We limited each funder to only two spots in the top 10 (otherwise The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies would have merited more mentions). The top 10 list spans nine funders and seven issue areas around the globe.
