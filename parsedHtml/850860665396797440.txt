There's your answer. https://t.co/bKqp6WKclg Should Spieth win, it would cap a historic turnaround, according to Sean Martin of the PGA Tour's official site: No Masters winner has trailed by more than 7 after 18 holes. Spieth was 10 back.

However, he bogeyed the 14th hole and carded a double-bogey on the 16th hole.
