Horrifying image generator turns your doodles into super weird cat pics
Horrifying image generator turns your doodles into super weird cat pics
What if your terrible cat drawings could look like the nightmarish real thing? Well now it can. Christopher Hesse has created an image-to-image translator , which is a program that has been trained to recognize certain visual cues and will match them with a corresponding photo. Hesse has created a few different iterations of the translator, one of which can generate building facades. Another can generate shoes, and still another does handbags. All of these generators are designed to read the doodle approximation of the object and then output an image that closely matches from a database of photos. SEE ALSO: This epic log flip challenge is the internet's next bottle flip In a weird turn from the norm, Hesse also created a version that turns doodles into cats, using the same principle. He tweeted out the exemplar for what this would look like.

It would be great for us to have our terrible cat doodles turned magically into a very photo-realistic cat. Since Hesse put the generator on the internet for anyone to use, people with our same thought have given it a try. The results were 100 percent not what Hesse showed us in his photo. Your attempts at a basic cat drawing becomes magically turned into some monstrous approximation of a real thing and you are left with unnatural horrors. Fun!

I'm sure we're going to see many of these creations in the next Resident Evil game. Until then, we are so done with this. Bye.
