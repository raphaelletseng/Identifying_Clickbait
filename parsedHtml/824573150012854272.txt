According to the Hindustan Times, Byapari married 25th wife Tania in 2011.

She filed a dowry case against him in the court of the local judicial magistrate in September.

The court then issued a warrant which led to the arrest.

He told her he had only married twice before.

However, after they married, she discovered she was his 25th wife and she managed to track down the name and addresses of 17 of her husband's wives, bdnews24 reported.

She claimed Byapari had two daughters with his second wife, a son with his third, another son with his seventh wife and a daughter with his 24th wife.

She also said her husband cited his work as an excuse to stay away from home.

Speaking to the website, she said: 'Without informing me, he married a girl from Matibhanga area of Rajapur Sadar Upazila.

[She divorced him after finding out about his wives], then in the middle of 2015 he married a Chittagong-based girl from Taltali.

'But he did not take her to his house and went on to marry a garment worker from Khulna.'

Tania also accused Byapari of assaulting her and demanding dowry.

His plea for bail was rejected pending further legal procedures, officials said.

Taltali police station's chief Kamalesh Halder confirmed the arrest.
