London attack: Photo of woman wearing hijab bypassing victim may not show full story

Updated

A photo showing a woman wearing a hijab and using her mobile phone while walking past a person injured in the London terrorist attack has sparked a debate online.

Warning: This story contains graphic images.

The woman was criticised by some Twitter users for walking past the victim — who was lying on the ground surrounded by other people — "without any concern".

US comedian Tim Young said it "could end up being one of the most iconic of our time".

But others were quick to point out numerous other people — who were not wearing hijabs — also walked past victims in the aftermath of the attack.

Some also pointed to the expression on the woman's face, which they described as distressed and concerned.

Others said the photo may have been taken out of context.
