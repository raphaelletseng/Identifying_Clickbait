Day Without Illegals Becomes a Political Dud
Day Without Illegals Becomes a Political Dud - Breitbart
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER The much-ballyhooed ‚ÄúDay Without Immigrants‚Äù turned out to be a day without many protestors or any political impact, but with many Mexican flags, angry slogans, and a muted social-media response by amnesty advocates. The Thursday turnout in most cities was few hundred protestors, despite some employers shutting their workplaces. But organizers¬†did get a turnout of several thousand people in North Carolina and Chicago. NBC described the national turnout as merely ‚Äúthousands,‚Äù despite an estimated population of roughly 11 million illegals.
