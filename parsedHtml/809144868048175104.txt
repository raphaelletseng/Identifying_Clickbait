The 23 best colleges in the Northeast


One of the biggest decisions someone can make is where they go to college. That's why Business Insider recently released its annual list ofÂ 50 best colleges in America.

ButÂ there's also another factor that's important when it comes to choosing a school: location. So we narrowed the list down to shine a light on the best colleges the Northeast has to offer.

For the ranking, we decided to shy away from a school's reputation and selectivity and focusedÂ on the overall college experience for students andÂ how well-prepared they are for the future. We looked at data made available by the government for post-graduate earnings as well as graduation rate.Â We thenÂ looked to Niche, a company that compiles research on schools, to find information about the student-life experience at each school.
