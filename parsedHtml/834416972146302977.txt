Jenna Jameson: Porn star launches anti-Muslim rant and apparent defence of the Ku Klux Klan
Jenna Jameson , one of the world’s most famous porn stars, has launched into a tirade against Muslims and an apparent defence of the Ku Klux Klan. Jameson’s anti-Muslim Twitter rant, which has taken place for the best part of 48 hours, was sparked by her defence of President Trump. The performer, who has appeared in almost 200 adult films, leapt to defend Mr Trump’s decision to cite a Swedish terrorist attack which appears never to have happened. The President sparked outrage and disbelief for the remark, prompting Sweden’s former Prime Minister to ask: “What has he been smoking?” But this did not stop Jameson, an outspoken Trump supporter who has a photo of the pair together as her Twitter background, from claiming Sweden was “a land of violence and fear”. She also suggested Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Mr Trump’s former Democrat presidential rival, take a “quick trip” to Sweden to properly understand what the women in the country are dealing with. Why don't you take a quick trip to Sweden you silver spooned moron... maybe you'll realize what the women of Sweden are facing 🖕🏻 https://t.co/ZLqJos9azo When probed about whether she had a problem with multicultural countries, Jameson said: “I have a problem with roving Muslim rape gangs... call me crazy.” “Listen you flat out idiot, Sweden is the rape capital of the world since it opened its arms to these sharia loving psychos #faceit,” she continued, citing a statistic that bears no relation to reality.

Throughout the exchange, Jameson, who last year announced she had converted to Judaism to marry her Israeli boyfriend Lior Bitton, used her religion to defend her inflammatory opinions. In recent times, Jameson has become known for sharing her provocative and at time far-right opinions about Muslims and immigrants on Twitter. More about: jenna jameson Donald Trump Comments
