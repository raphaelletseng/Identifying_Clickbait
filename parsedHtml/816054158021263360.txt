Liberals Celebrate Knockout of 'Weak White B**ch’ Ronda Rousey Over Her 'White Privilege' - Breitbart
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Famed bantamweight fighter Ronda Rousey once again jumped into the ring after a long hiatus from fighting, only for opponent Amanda Nunes to best her in a mere 48 seconds. After the fight liberals jumped to social media with glee to mock Rousey and to attack her for her supposed “white privilege.” After a devastating loss to Holly Holm in 2015, Rousey tried for a come back by facing Brazilian Nunes at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, on December 30. But the nearly immediate KO she experienced became fodder for mocking. FOR OUR NEWSLETTER A variety of mean memes mocked Rousey, such as those likening her pummeled face to the famous “The Scream” painting and other jokes. Even pop singer Justin Bieber jumped in to mock the female fighter. But the perceived “white privilege” upset liberals the most. Rousey, whose name is far bigger than her opponent’s and who also had a lot more at stake, upset liberals by receiving $3 million for the fight while her relatively unknown opponent, Amanda Nunes, only got $200,000 for the bout. Liberals deemed the disparity in take an example of “white privilege.” #Nunez won the fight but somehow #rousey is still trending more #whiteprivilege — dyango briones (@DyangoB) December 31, 2016 RT @mikaelherard : The contender, Rousey gets $3 million for that loss while Nunes gets $200k with win bonus. #america  #WhitePrivilege — TakeMobGeneral (@TakeMobGeneral) December 31, 2016 @esob0i  @DameTamer631 This is much better lol #whiteprivilege  #rouseyvsnunes  @Amanda_Leoa  pic.twitter.com/OiKZiIxAs2 — J.
