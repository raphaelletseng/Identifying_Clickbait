Women share harrowing stories of sexual assault
Women share harrowing stories of sexual assault


Women who have been sexually assaulted in public have opened up about their experiences, sadly revealing how they're often not taken seriously.

The victims shared their harrowing experiences anonymously via the secret-sharing app Whisper, and one admitted that when she told her best friend all she did was laugh.

Some were brave enough to fight back, with one admitting to stealing her attacker's car keys in revenge and another to breaking a man's nose in a club. Others were simply too terrified to react.

Tragically, some did not even know they were being assaulted at the time - with the gravity of the incident only dawning on them years later.
