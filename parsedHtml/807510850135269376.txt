My son and his kids, me and my husband, we all became ill. All of this is because of the war. May God have mercy on us. We wish that God would help us to get to a safe country so that I, my son and his kids may live in stability. My dream was to see each one of my kids living in a house and to educate their children.

I wasnâ€™t able to continue studying because of what happened in Syria, [because] of bombing and displacement. It became dangerous for me to get out of the house or to go to school. Schools were bombed. We immigrated to Turkey and stayed for a year where I wasnâ€™t able to continue my studying. I sat at home because of the residence visa issue and the conditions they require in Turkey to join school. We came here to seek refuge in the European countries.
