Orlando Magic general manager Rob Hennigan denied the agent for Argentine guard Patricio Garino, Carlos Prunes, inadvertently revealed the team's offseason plans Monday.

Hennigan told the Orlando Sentinel's Josh Robbins the names on the whiteboard were "not indicative of plans" and the team was "simply listing options, including some of which other teams have inquired about."

TheScore shared the photo from Prunes' since-deleted tweet:

Although Hennigan said otherwise, it's hard to see how the names aren't indicative to some extent of what the Magic want to do in the offseason, unless Orlando purposefully had Prunes post the photo as subterfuge, which would encompass master-level scheming.

While the Magic weren't responsible for the leak, having Garino sign his contract in front of the whiteboard wasn't a great idea in retrospect.

It's also not a good look for a general manager who may be on the hot seat. ESPN.com's Marc Stein reported in March the Magic are considering firing Hennigan at the end of the year.
