'Russophobic' Romania a clear threat, Moscow says as it hits out at new Nato deployments
he Russian government views Romania as a military threat whose government is pursuing “Russophobic” policies, a senior diplomat said. Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, who heads a department for European affairs at the Russian foreign minister, said the former Communist nation’s stance on EU sanctions and decision to host elements of a Nato missile defence system made it a “clear threat.” "Romania's stance and the stance of its leadership, who have turned the country into an outpost, is a clear threat for us," he told Russia’s Interfax news agency. "All these decisions ... are in the first instance aimed against Russia," he said, accusing Romanian authorities of reveling in anti-Russian rhetoric. The $800 million Romanian element of Nato’s missile defence shield, which includes a base hosting SM3 medium range interceptor missiles, went online in May last year. Nato and US officials say the missile defence system, which was initially announced in 2007, is designed to protect Nato allies from ballistic missiles launched by Iran. Moscow says the real purpose of the shield is to erode Russia’s nuclear deterrent by reducing its chances of a successful retaliation in the event of being attacked by another country's nuclear missiles. In 2009 Barack Obama scrapped plans to base long-range interceptor missiles in the Czech Republic and Poland, partly in response to Russian concerns. Russia has said the changes did not go far enough. Romania was part of the Moscow-allied Warsaw Pact until the end of the Cold War. It joined Nato in 2004, as part of an eastward expansion of the alliance that the Kremlin has bitterly criticized. The Romanian Foreign Ministry said in an emailed statement: "Romania constantly highlighted both publicly and through contacts with our partners that the anti-missile defence system, hosted by our country at Deveselu, is not directed against Russia, having a purely defensive purpose, fully consistent with the relevant provisions set out in the UN Charter." "Therefore, the perpetuation in the public space of a rhetoric that does not take into account all these elements is neither appropriate nor able to facilitate a constructive approach." Mr Botsan-Kharchenko’s comments came as Russia hit out at the recent deployment of Nato troops to eastern central Europe, including the Baltic states.

We do not have such information. For the first time since World War Two we see German soldiers along our borders," he added. erman troops arrived in Lithuania last month as part of an enhanced forward presence designed to reassure eastern Nato allies in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine. The move has also seen the United States deploy thousands of soldiers with heavy weaponry to Poland, the Baltic States, and south eastern Europe. A British battalion including tanks is due to deploy to Estonia by spring.
