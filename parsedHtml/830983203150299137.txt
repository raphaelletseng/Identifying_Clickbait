Tina Knowles introduced her daughter Beyonce for a phenomenal performance that showed a different side to her fierce Super Bowl 2016 persona.

The visibly pregnant star appeared in a glittering gold costume as a video of her surrounded by women in a trippy visual sequence.

"Do you remember being born?" she asks, opening with the monologue from 2016's Lemonade.

Raised on a platform she walked down a walkway before launching into 'Love Drought', the sensual, challenging track from her recent album which fans took to be written about her own relationship.

A direct look at the camera felt as though Bey was staring right into the audience's soul, turning as it moved, before she looked out at the audience again.

Holding a hand to her stomach she gave an exquisite rendition of 'Sandcastles'.
