The WeekndÂ and NAVÂ are doubling down on their provocative collaboration "Some Way" with a new model-laden video that dropped Friday (March 3).Â

The grainy RJ Sanchez-directed video shows the two at a photo shoot with more than a dozen models doing a mix of posing and partying while the two Toronto artists sing along to the track.Â

When "Some Way" came out last month, many believed it might be The Weeknd's clap-back at Justin Bieber over recent comments related to Bieber's ex and The Weekend's current girlfriend, Selena Gomez.Â

The sentiment is perhaps understandable, considering The Weeknd's lyrics such as, "I think your girl, think your girl fell in love with me/ She say my f--- and my tongue gave a remedy," and then later, "I just took that chick, and I know you feeling some way/ She just want a n---a like me, you feeling some way."

"Some Way" appears on NAV's self-titled album that was released last week on The Weeknd's XO label.
