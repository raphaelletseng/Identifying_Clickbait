A quarter of Europeans think there are 'more acceptable' rapes


A quarter of all Europeans think there are certain situations where rape can be 'more acceptable' - for example if the victim is drunk, scantily dressed or has invited a man to her home.

The report also found that one in five Europeans believed women often made up or exaggerated rape claims.

The shocking figures, which include wild variations between different countries, are included in a report on gender-based violence, commissioned by the European Union.

Eastern European nations - including Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Latvia - were among those countries where people were more willing to blame the victim, but also in Belgium.

Ireland, Spain and Scandinavian countries were the least willing to excuse the actions of a rapist.

Researchers spoke to 30,000 people in all 28 EU countries in June this year, and have just published the report, which covers attitudes to domestic violence and sexual harassment as well as rape.

The survey, reported in News.com, found seven percent of people thought rape was also justified if the woman was walking alone at night, had flirted with her attacker or even if she had been promiscuous.

The report showed shocking attitudes among some people in the European Union towards rape, including the suggestion that a rape involving a woman who dressed provocatively was somehow less serious STOCK PHOTO

Some Europeans found rape more acceptable if the attacker didnâ€™t know what they were doing and if they regretted their actions.

Almost three quarters of respondents think domestic violence against women is common in their country.
