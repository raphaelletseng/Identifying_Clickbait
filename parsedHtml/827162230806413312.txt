The last time taxpayers got relief was in 1997 when P Chidambaram presented his "dream budget". This time, the relief will benefit around 2 crore taxpayers.

However, those with income between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore have been hit with a surcharge of 10%. Their tax liability can go up by about Rs 2.9 lakh.

Above the income of Rs 3.5 lakh, there will be no rebate. So, if one has income of Rs 4 lakh, liability on taxable income of Rs 1.50 lakh will be Rs 7,500 at 5% as rebate is not allowed for an income above Rs 3.5 lakh. Similarly, for a person with an income of Rs 5 lakh, net tax liability after rebate in 2016 was Rs 20,000, which has come down to Rs 12,500. So, this class of taxpayer will gain by Rs 7,500. As earlier, the Rs 5,000 rebate was not available to those with income of more than Rs 5 lakh, they will benefit the most, saving Rs 12,500 from the rate cut.
