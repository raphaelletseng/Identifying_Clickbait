REPORT: Anthony Scaramucci is headed to the White House as an assistant to Trump


Anthony Scaramucci is headed to the White House.

The founder of the hedge fund SkyBridge Capital has been named an assistant to President-elect Donald Trump, according to Bloomberg's Simone Foxman and Kevin Cirilli, who cited people familiar with the appointment. Scaramucci is a member of Trump's transition team.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Scaramucci's role could include serving as Trump's liaison to Wall Street, advising him on policies that would affect the business community.

Scaramucci is another former Goldman Sachs staffer heading to the White House despite the campaign's criticism of Washington's ties to Wall Street. He joined the bank's real-estate investment unit in 1989 after graduating from Harvard Law School. He said in 2012 that he was fired from Goldman after he intentionally failed a Series 7 exam as part of a bet with friends on who could score the lowest. He was later rehired.

Scaramucci is a host of the TV show "Wall Street Week." His hedge fund managed $9.2 billion as of the end of January 2015, according to Bloomberg.

Business Insider's Linette Lopez and Josh Barro interviewed Scaramucci this summer for their podcast, "Hard Pass." Listen below:
