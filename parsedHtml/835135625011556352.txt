Ukip leader Paul Nuttall isn't having the greatest week.

Last night, Ukip were emphatically beaten by Labour in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election.

Despite increasing their voteshare by two per cent, and Labour losing two per cent, they were edged out of the consituency seat dubbed the 'Brexit capital' because of its near-70 per cent Leave vote.

Nigel Farage, former leader of Ukip, told Nuttall at the spring conference that a victory in Stoke was "absolutely crucial".

The defeat raises doubt about Ukip's future ability to capitalise on Labour's falling standing and Brexit.

Nuttall was forced to apologise for claiming that he was a Hillsborough survivor - or that he had friends who died there - leading to a wave of resignations.
