Dad slightly bemused to find his son's chocolate Santa Claus looks totally inappropriate
Dad slightly bemused to find his son's chocolate Santa Claus looks totally inappropriate


On a quiet Thursday night on Twitter, Col Talbot uploaded a photo of his son eating a Cadbury's chocolate Santa Claus.

With all the wrapping on, they look a bit like this:





But Talbot noticed that once the wrapping was taken off, from a certain angle at least, the chocolate figurine looked altogether rather... different.

He tweeted his findings to Cadbury:

Hi @CadburyUK, my little lad loves your chocolate but I think your chocolate Santa Claus cast needs some work!!! pic.twitter.com/qHCjIVTXQt — Col (@ColTalbot1) December 8, 2016

There was some mixed reaction:

Some people just didn't know what to say:

Others invoked the Lord:

@ColTalbot1 @fckraza @CadburyUK filthy minded people are the problem... you need to see Jesus — Lee Froggatt (@lee_paul86) December 8, 2016

Some people swore:

Others called for an investigation:

@ColTalbot1 @CadburyUK it's a known fact there everywhere ! The person responsible for the chocolate mould should be investigated. — Olwyn Hope (@OlwynHope) December 9, 2016

It's not the first disrobed St Nicholas to look quite phallic:

But any word from Cadbury? An (admittedly, slightly bemused) Talbot told indy100:

Haha, no Cadbury's haven't replied.

On the response his photo provoked, Talbot added:

You get the odd person taking it too seriously. At the end of he day it's a picture of chocolate Father Christmas taken at an unfortunate angle.

Does he think the chocolate company will be changing its moulds? Will there be a campaign?

I doubt it.

And a Merry Christmas to all.
