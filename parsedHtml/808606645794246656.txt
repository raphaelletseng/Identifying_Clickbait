Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh announced after Monday night’s game with the New England Patriots that former NFL tight end Konrad Reuland has died following a brain aneurysm.

“Just want to offer condolences to his family. We love Konrad Reuland,” Harbaugh said, via CSN Mid-Atlantic. “Every single guy in that locker room loves him who knows him.”

Reuland had emergency surgery two weeks ago in hopes of rectifying the issue but he succumbed on Monday.

Reuland spent parts of six seasons in the NFL with four different teams. He was with the Indianapolis Colts in training camp before being released at the end of the preseason during the team’s final roster cuts. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Jets and Ravens. He appeared in 30 games with 12 catches for 90 yards.
