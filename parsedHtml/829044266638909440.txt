Trump offers to 'destroy' career of Texas state senator whom sheriff complained about


President Donald Trump appeared to quip Tuesday that he would "destroy" the career of a state senator in Texas who introduced legislation that a county sheriff doesn't like.

Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson complained about the senator to Trump during a meeting on Tuesday in the White House with sheriffs from across the US. Eavenson will most likely be the next president of the National Sheriffs' Association, according to The Dallas Morning News.

"A state senator in Texas was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we could receive that forfeiture money" from drug traffickers, Eavenson said.

"Can you believe that?" Trump replied.

Eavenson continued: "I told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation passed."

"Who is the state senator?" Trump then asked. "Do you want to give his name?"

Eavenson shrugged.

"We'll destroy his career," Trump said as people around him laughed.

It wasn't immediately clear to whom Eavenson was referring, but a bill that was recently introduced in the Texas Senate would prohibit Texas law enforcement from seizing a person's assets before a conviction is won. Sen. Konni Burton, a Republican, authored the bill, and Sen. Juan Hinojosa coauthored it.

Law-enforcement agencies have largely opposed such bills.
