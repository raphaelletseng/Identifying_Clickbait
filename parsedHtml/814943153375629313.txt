With 2:08 left in the third quarter of Friday's Liberty Bowl, TCU wide receiver John Diarse hauled in an unreal nine-yard touchdown to give his team a 23-21 lead.

The junior LSU transfer kept control of the rock despite swarming defense from Georgia Bulldogs cornerback Deandre Baker. As Baker got physical, Diarse protected the ball with his left hand while falling to the ground.

There's nothing you can do as a defender here:

This was Diarse's second score of the afternoon. He previously caught a 10-yard touchdown to give the Horned Frogs a 16-7 lead in the second quarter.
