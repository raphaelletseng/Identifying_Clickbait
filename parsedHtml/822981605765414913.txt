US truck driver 'loses his marbles' on Indiana highway

Updated

A truck driver has "lost his marbles" and his trailer on an Indiana highway in the United States.

State police said the truck carrying about 17,000 kilograms of marbles lost its trailer on an Indianapolis highway.

Sergeant John Perrine of Indiana State Police tweeted a picture of thousands of marbles spilled out of the rolled trailer and onto a median strip.

"#Breaking: A truck driver has lost his marbles," Sergeant Perrine said.

There were no injuries, but a lane of traffic in that area was affected by the clean-up for much of the day.
