Israeli Burger King gives out 'adult toys' for Valentine's Day
You may remember the children’s toys you used to get from fast food restaurants as being, well, a bit rubbish. But Burger King is hoping to bring the joy of toys back for an adult-only market with its new meal deal - which includes an ‘adult toy’. Israeli branches of the fast food chain will be selling special meal boxes after 6pm today, aimed at couples who want to celebrate the one day of the year dedicated to love. It may look like a kids’ meal, but this is strictly adults-only - the box contains two Whoppers, two packets of fries, two beers and an unspecified sex toy.   The new KFC creation getting people in a frenzy Judging by the picture, anyone who decides to purchase the box will find either an eye-mask, a feather duster or a head-massager. So, no, not the kinkiest ‘adult toys’ out there, but undoubtedly saucier than the usual offerings in a kids’ box. Because what says ‘I love you’ better than a burger and a tickle with a feather duster? While Burger King may not be the most obvious choice of restaurant for a special romantic dinner, perhaps the chain is hoping to scoop up diners who couldn’t get a reservation anywhere else - or burnt the dinner they tried to cook themselves. Reaction to the news has, however, been mixed: Like, putting sex toys in to Burger King meals has to be the outer limit of commodification Burger King funny asl 😂😂... they got an adults meal box that comes with an toy only offered today on Valentine's Day at 6 🤦🏽‍♂️ Wait.. So Burger King has an adult meal today where they're giving away a kinky sex toy with an grown folks type "happy meal".. Wow.. But considering many women live by the mantra of ‘fries before guys,’ at least the meal deal would allow you to have both. The boxes are strictly for over-18s, so presumably IDs will be checked for any young-looking people hoping to treat their other-halves this Valentine’s Day. Hopefully the box will leave couples, ahem, satisfied. More about: Fast Food St Valentine's Day Sex toys Comments
