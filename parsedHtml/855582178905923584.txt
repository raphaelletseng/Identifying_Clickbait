If you haven’t looked at Google Earth recently, now would be a good time for a return visit. Google just released a new version and it’s amazing.

It’s also an almost irresistible time sink. We live on a rich and varied planet and Google Earth is doing everything it can to make the earth’s visual wonders available to all. It’s very easy to lose time exploring Google Earth; you’ve been forewarned.

The first new feature you'll find when you check out the menu on the left side of the screen is Voyager, a collection of interactive guided tours. The Voyages are organized under the headings Travel, Nature, Culture, History and Editor’s Picks. Each one takes you to different places and tells you about what's going on there using slideshows, videos and brief text panels Google calls Knowledge Cards.

Google Earth now includes the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. There are over 20,000 lucky landing places with Knowledge Cards, collections of pictures and links to related places.
