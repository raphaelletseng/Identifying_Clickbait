Brexit: Paris could lure 20,000 finance jobs from Britain with moves starting within weeks
Paris could lure as many as 20,000 workers from Britain’s finance industry with the exodus potentially starting within weeks as the UK begins its withdrawal from the European Union, according to Europlace, the French capital’s lobby group. Paris will make its case to London-based executives in a series of February meetings as it competes for talent with rival cities such as Frankfurt. Europlace’s marketing materials show it will extol how Paris already employs more than 180,000 financiers, is home to the region’s biggest bond market and boasts the second-largest pool of asset managers. The continental race to take advantage of Brexit is heating up as Prime Minister Theresa May plans to trigger the start of negotiations by the end of March . Global bank chiefs have warned Ms May that they will soon start shifting operations and jobs from the UK to elsewhere in the EU unless she can protect their easy access to its market.   Brexit isn't Europe's biggest problem, KPMG boss warns “We feel decisions will be taken in the first semester of the new year,” Arnaud de Bresson, Europlace’s managing director, said in an interview in London. “We see institutions are accelerating their process of thinking.” Read more Theresa May's New Year's Eve Brexit promise is 'utterly meaningless' Brexit: The Movie being lined up by Warner Bros KitKat's chocolate bar 'will not be downsized due to Brexit' Why the FTSE 100 reaching record high is not necessarily good news ​ HSBC already said in the run-up to last year’s referendum that it planned to move as many as 1,000 employees to Paris from London if voters backed Brexit, while Citigroup is now considering relocating some of its London-based equity and interest-rate derivatives traders to Frankfurt.

Paris could lure as many as 20,000 workers from Britain’s finance industry with the exodus potentially starting within weeks as the UK begins its withdrawal from the European Union, according to Europlace, the French capital’s lobby group.

Paris will make its case to London-based executives in a series of February meetings as it competes for talent with rival cities such as Frankfurt. Europlace’s marketing materials show it will extol how Paris already employs more than 180,000 financiers, is home to the region’s biggest bond market and boasts the second-largest pool of asset managers.

The continental race to take advantage of Brexit is heating up as Prime Minister Theresa May plans to trigger the start of negotiations by the end of March. Global bank chiefs have warned Ms May that they will soon start shifting operations and jobs from the UK to elsewhere in the EU unless she can protect their easy access to its market.

“We feel decisions will be taken in the first semester of the new year,” Arnaud de Bresson, Europlace’s managing director, said in an interview in London. “We see institutions are accelerating their process of thinking.”

With time at a premium, bankers say they want to establish new or expanded offices in the EU before the UK leaves, which is currently set for some time in 2019. Ms May says she wants to strike the best possible deal for banks, yet hasn’t detailed what she will seek and also declines to fully endorse the transitional phase industry wants to smooth the departure.

​HSBC already said in the run-up to last year’s referendum that it planned to move as many as 1,000 employees to Paris from London if voters backed Brexit, while Citigroup is now considering relocating some of its London-based equity and interest-rate derivatives traders to Frankfurt. TheCityUK lobby group warns that almost 70,000 jobs are up for grabs.

Europlace will argue Paris is better placed than other aspirants for London’s crown.
