Warren Frost, star of US television series Twin Peaks, has died aged 91.

The actor, who played Dr Will Hayward, also had roles in comedy show Seinfeld and legal drama Matlock.

Long before finding fame, he served in the US Navy and took part in the D-Day landings during World War Two.

His death came after a long illness, said his son Mark Frost, who was Twin Peaks' co-creator. "We're saddened today to announce the passing of our dear old dad," he said.

In Twin Peaks, Mr Frost's character played crucial part in discovering the body of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), whose murder is investigated through the series.

He also features in the long-awaited Twin Peaks sequel, which is set to premiere in May.

In Seinfeld, he had a regular role as Mr Ross, the father of George Costanza's fiancee Susan.

Paying tribute to his father, his son added: "From the Normandy shores on D-Day to his 50-year career on stage and screen, he remained the same humble guy from Vermont who taught us that a life devoted to telling the right kind of truths can make a real difference in the lives of others."
