2017 NFL Schedule: W-L Predictions for Every Team
2017 NFL Schedule: W-L Predictions for Every Team
2017 NFL Schedule: W-L Predictions for Every Team Predictions are never an easy task for us football writers. Not only are we guaranteed to be wrong in some way, but people yell at us—yeah, I'm talking about you! "You idiot! There's no way (insert favorite team here) goes (insert bad record here)!" That was the PG version, but it's bound to happen, and I already look forward to it after this slideshow (bring it on). But keep this in mind before you yell at me: This is all on paper and also before the NFL draft. Things could change. In addition to predicting the records of every team, I've pegged the toughest game and also the game(s) that should be considered "prove-it" games for each team. As we all know, the New England Patriots are good, the Oakland Raiders are good, the New York Jets stink (and are fun to laugh at) and also, the Cleveland Browns stink. Straight up: It was just as hard to pick a Jets win as it was to pick a Patriots loss. It's probably never a good idea to predict an undefeated or a totally defeated team, but both are possible. So let's get this out of the way now and ahead of time: I'm probably (well, definitely) going to be wrong on some (most) stuff. We see new teams emerge every season that we never see coming. In the mean time, get ready for the draft and see where your team stands now that the NFL schedule has finally been released and plan all your trips to stadiums accordingly. Happy Schedule Release Day! Arizona Cardinals (2016 Record: 7-8-1 )  : vs. New York Giants (Week 16) Spoiler alert: The NFC East is going to belong to the New York Giants in 2017, thus making them the toughest opponent for the Cardinals this season. Yeah, they play against the Dallas Cowboys and the Seattle Seahawks as they do every year, but my gut feeling is that the Giants are going to be a team to be reckoned with in 2017, despite Eli Manning selling fake helmets, or whatever. Fortunately for the Cardinals the game is at home, but this team is going to be a tough out for anyone. It will be interesting to see where these teams are at this late in the season.  : both Seahawks games (Week 10 and 17), at Detroit Lions (Week 1) The NFC West seemingly belongs to the Seattle Seahawks every season, but the Seahawks are not unfamiliar territory to the Cardinals. The Cardinals may have been 7-8-1 in 2016, but they didn't lose to the Seahawks—they won on the road and tied at home—damn you, Chandler Catanzaro. With that said, the Seahawks are still the Seahawks and while division games are different than any others, taking it to the Seahawks once again this season is a must—even though one of the games is their final game of the season. Next up, on the road against the Detroit Lions—a team that is somewhat on the same level as the Cardinals. Quality road wins are what define a teams overall success. The Cardinals already have, essentially, four easy wins against the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams. They'll be tested on the road against teams like the Lions, Houston Texans, and Washington Redskins.  Atlanta Falcons (2016 Record: 11-5) What can one even say about the Atlanta Falcons? They had perhaps the most crushing, agonizing, gut-wrenching loss we've ever seen in a Super Bowl last season. Barring any long-term hangovers, the Falcons should be right back in the saddle as an NFC contender. They're virtually the same team as last year. However, they did add nose tackle Dontari Poe to add to an already talented front seven. Led by quarterback Matt Ryan , wide receiver Julio Jones and running back Devonta Freeman, the Falcons should have no issues taking over the NFC South once again. PS: Good job Atlanta on extending cornerback Desmond Trufant.  : at New England Patriots (Week 7) This is just some cruel and unusual punishment, @nflcommish. After loss on stage you want to send the Falcons Foxboro to take on the Patriots? At least let them have them at home! This may be the most-watched game of the season. The story writes itself here, folks.  : vs. Dallas Cowboys (Week 10) The Dallas Cowboys were top dogs in the NFC last season, only to lose to the Green Bay Packers at home in their opening round. Who knows if the Cowboys will be in their similar dominating form in 2017? Chances are they probably might be, though. At home, the Falcons get to do battle with them, which sets up for the ultimate prove-it game. The Cowboys could end up being the Falcons biggest enemy when it comes to securing a number one seed (assuming my New York Giants take is awful). The Falcons are also good enough to hang with the fellow heavyweights (as evidenced by, you know, making the Super Bowl). If the Falcons can get it done, this game will re-affirm our belief in them. Hopefully, for their sake, they're never up 28-3 on a team ever again.  Baltimore Ravens (2016 Record: 8-8) For many years, the Baltimore Ravens have always been a dark horse in the AFC playoff picture. They remain competitive against teams such as the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers, but they come up short more often than not. It's no secret—the offense is perhaps one of the most boring units in football and with Steve Smith retiring and Kamar Aiken gone, the Ravens offense looks even more pedestrian on paper. However, their defense is setting up to be quite stingy in 2017 with the additions of cornerback Brandon Carr and safety Tony Jefferson. No, Carr isn't a superstar, but he's an upgrade over whoever the heck was opposite Jimmy Smith in 2016. Speaking of defense, the Ravens did trade away defensive lineman Timmy Jernigan, so his shoes will need to be filled. The Ravens are somewhere in the middle this season—to apply a football term, they're a tweener. They're not a bad football, but they don't come off as a serious threat to create any noise either. Of course, this is all ahead of the draft so things could change, but the Ravens appears to be headed in the right direction even though they lost a few weapons—remember, they did add running back Danny Woodhead. Staying healthy and adding pass rushers and maybe a receiver in the draft should pay huge dividends. : at Oakland Raiders (Week 5) The game against the Green Bay Packers in Week 11 was a consideration here, but staying within the same conference, the Oakland Raiders are the toughest opponent on the Baltimore Ravens schedule. Not only will the Ravens have to do battle against Raiders quarterback Derek Carr and his myriad weapons on offense, but the Raiders and Ravens could end up duking it out for wild card spots in the end (this is of course assuming that the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs remain good football teams). On paper, the Ravens offensive line is average at best, so going up against a defense led by Raiders superhuman (and oh, defensive end) Khalil Mack will be quite the test. After losing Carr last season, the Raiders will be back this season with a vengeance. This game might be too much for the Ravens to ultimately overcome.  : at Green Bay Packers (Week 11), vs. Detroit Lions (Week 13), both games against the Pittsburgh Steelers (Week 4 and 14) We'll get this out of the way: Any game against the Pittsburgh Steelers for the Ravens is a gimme—those are games they need to win, especially in what should become quite the finish in the AFC North. Now we'll move to the NFC North opponents the Ravens will face this year in the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers. As mentioned, the Ravens are in a tweener area when it comes to what kind of football team they are. They aren't bad by any stretch, but they haven't been good lately. With additions like safety Tony Jefferson, it's clear that the Ravens want to move on from that narrative and that's why a game in Green Bay is a prove it game—if they can get it done there, look out. They may not even necessarily need to win, but how they stack up against a perennial Super Bowl contender is important. From there, the Lions are a slight notch below the Packers, but still a quality football team nonetheless. A game in Lambeau is a different animal, but beating a quality team in the Lions at home will be telling. If they are able to do so, we will at least know that the Ravens won't make their record what it is based on bad football teams. Quality wins are key. I'd like to move away from having mediocre teams that squeeze into the playoffs because of schedules.  Buffalo Bills (2016 Record: 7-9) Why don't we start off by saying this: Thank goodness the Buffalo Bills brought quarterback Tyrod Taylor back—even if it is for only one-year essentially. Not only did they bring Taylor back, but they signed one of the more underrated free agents out there this offseason in defensive back Micah Hyde. Sure, they lost cornerback Stephon Gilmore to those damn New England Patriots, but they were expected to lose him given what he was looking for money-wise and after they didn't franchise-tag him. Two other under-the-radar moves the Bills did to help out their offense was the signings of both Patrick DiMarco and Mike Tolbert—that's right, fullbacks! Though they are "just fullbacks" these guys will help out running back LeSean McCoy in terms of blocking and helping create space. The wide receiver position is a bit of a concern for the Bills who also lost wide receiver Robert Woods to the Los Angeles Rams, but given the Bills top-10 draft choice, that, or tight end O.J. Howard could be a solution to that issue. Taylor is a fun, dynamic player, but the AFC East is still run by the Patriots.  : at Atlanta Falcons (Week 4) Tempting to put their annual meeting with the New England Patriots here, but the Atlanta Falcons game will get the nod due to divisional familiarity. The one plus side for the Bills against the Falcons is that at least they'll be in doors and not out in the frigid Buffalo temperatures. Other than that, this is going to be a tall mountain to climb for any team this season—going into Atlanta. The Falcons should take this one.  : both games against the Miami Dolphins (Week 15 and 17), vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Week 7) Are the Bills a playoff team? Eh, not really. However, the Miami Dolphins are assumed to be the second best team in the AFC East, so wins against them would prove otherwise. Who knows, the Bills could have an outside chance at a playoff run, but getting through the Dolphins, at a minimum, will be key. The teams are towards the end of the season, so this series could turn into a series that proves who the second-best team in the AFC East is. As far as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Buffalo goes, we all know that Buffalo can be a tough place to play in. A win over the Buccaneers would prove to everyone that the Bills are an improving team—not quite playoff material, but they'd be showing that they're getting there. They have other tough games this season against the Oakland Raiders and the New England Patriots, but those aren't exactly the proper games to target here. Of course, a win over either of those teams would also be nice, though, if the Bills hope to push the envelope for a playoff appearance.  Carolina Panthers (2016 Record: 6-10) The Carolina Panthers had an atrocious 2016 after appearing in Super Bowl 50, going 6-10. Quarterback Cam Newton wasn't his MVP self, the offensive line was inconsistent, the cornerbacks were both rookies and inexperienced, their first round pick, defensive tackle Vernon Butler, didn't play a ton—the list goes on and on. There is a bright spot, however: The Panthers did lose six games by three of fewer points. Newton is still a dynamic player, they have tight end Greg Olsen, wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, linebacker Luke Kuechly—the list goes on and on because this isn't a bad football team. Bringing in offensive tackle Matt Kalil and, even in his advanced age, linebacker Julius Peppers (who should have nice sack totals) should certainly help. This is still a double-digit win ball club on paper, but translating that to the field is a different story.  : at New England Patriots (Week 4) From now on (if you hadn't already received the hint), if you see "Toughest game: at New England Patriots", I don't really a see a point in explaining why that is a teams hardest game.  : divisional games (Weeks 3, 8, 9, 13, 17), vs. Green Bay Packers (Week 15) The Packers is a tough game, regardless of location, but the focal point for the Panthers this season needs to be wins in their division—this is a pretty stout division. In a division that consists of the reigning NFC champion Atlanta falcons, the up-and-coming Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Drew Brees -led New Orleans Saints, these are all games they need to win. A win over the Packers really just launches the Panthers into another echelon—I don't believe the 2016 Panthers could have hung with them.  Chicago Bears (2016 Record: 3-13) Overall, the Chicago Bears had a fairly nice offseason when it came to free agency. Although they lost both Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley at quarterback and Alshon Jeffery at wide receiver, the did add guys like safety Quintin Demps, cornerback Prince Amukamara and wide receivers Kendall Wright and Markus Wheaton. Their most controversial signing, though, is quite possibly quarterback Mike Glennon. The contract in and of itself is OK (though he'll be getting paid $15 million in 2017), but I'm still not sure why they went in this direction when they could have just deployed Barkley for another year, assuming they draft a quarterback in the upcoming draft. Glennon doesn't feel like enough of an upgrade for me. The Bears should be in line for another top-five pick in the 2018 draft. 2017 will be another cellar-dweller season in the Windy City. Drafting a player like Ohio State safety Malik Hooker will give the Bears a playmaker who can turn the ball over. However, he does have issues when it comes to tackling. : vs. Atlanta Falcons (Week 1) Welcome to 2017, Chicago. You draw the Falcons in Week 1—yippee. 0-1. A bonafide bottom-three team in the league versus a team that was about 20 minutes away from a Super Bowl title the previous season? Yeah, a game against the Atlanta Falcons is the toughest game for the Bears and Glennon this season. The Bears did get a couple of pieces in the secondary, but they're going to get throttled by this offense.  : vs. Cleveland Browns (Week 16), vs. San Francisco 49ers (Week 13) When it comes to prove-it games for the Bears, they're simply going to be just trying to prove they aren't the worst team in the NFL. Hence their prove-it games being against the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers. Barkley/Hoyer revenge game and the Browns. Out of their three projected wins, these could be two of them.  Cincinnati Bengals (2016 Record: 6-9-1) While they may still have wide receiver A.J. Green , the Cincinnati Bengals once again lost some key free agents this offseason—most importantly along the offensive line, which is a position they should address in the draft. Yes, I'm referring to Andrew Whitworth and Kevin Zeitler who fled to the Los Angeles Rams and Cleveland Browns, respectively. Sure, they brought in offensive tackle Andre Smith and, on defense, linebacker Kevin Minter, but come on people—those moves aren't in the same stratosphere as Whitworth and Zeitler. Now the Bengals employ an offensive line that is projected to have Jake Fisher as their starting offensive tackle—he played in just 300 snaps in 2016 and was ranked 136th at the offensive tackle position, according to Pro Football Focus . In 2016, the Bengals went 6-9-1. Turn that tie into a loss and that's where they're finishing this year, if not worse given the loss to two key offensive lineman. The Bengals better hope Green stay healthy for all 16 games, or this could get uglier.  : at Green Bay Packers (Week 3) Not to cop out, but this one kind of writes itself, no? The Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field are a different animal. Keeping that in mind with what I expect out of the Bengals in 2017, hopefully the Bengals can manage to walk away from this game without getting shellacked too hard. Give the Bengals the "L" here.  : at Denver Broncos (Week 11) If the Bengals want to show the football world that they mean business (well, the business of not being totally terrible), going on the road against the Denver Broncos is certainly a nice way to do it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian throw for five touchdowns against the Bengals in 2016? I know, in Denver might be asking a lot out of a prove-it game, but how they play on the road against a tough opponent in the Broncos will really give us idea of what to expect from this team. Another good pick here would be at home against the Detroit Lions.  Cleveland Browns (2016 Record: 1-15) Let me start by saying this: I personally cannot wait until the Cleveland Browns are a good football team. I really can't. With Cody Kessler set to be the teams starting quarterback come Week 1 (barring them drafting a quarterback and starting him foolishly), the Browns are still going to be in the basement in the AFC North. Give them props, though—they did sign guard Kevin Zeitler, center J.C. Tretter and wide receiver Kenny Britt to replace Terrelle Pryor . I'm hoping we are able to see a more competitive Browns season, but it's still going to be a low win, high draft choice season. Good news, though: They won't have the No. 1 overall pick (or is that actually bad news?).  : vs. Green Bay Packers (Week 14) Dear Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers , Please go easy on the Browns. They have families. Your's truly, Everyone. Especially Browns fans.  : at Chicago Bears (Week 16), vs. New York Jets (Week 5) Yeah, overall, the Chicago Bears and New York Jets are mediocre opponents, but they are the perfect measuring stick for the Browns. This is essentially measuring how bad the team is. If they are able to take out the Jets at home and/or the Bears on the road, it will be clear that this team is moving towards not being the worst team in the NFL. Not all that exciting, but the Browns nearly went winless in 2016. Give them a break.  Dallas Cowboys (2016 Record: 13-3) With quarterback Tony Romo now off the roster and those potential distractions out of the way, the Dallas Cowboys have officially entered the Era of Dak Prescott (if they didn't already last season). Though Prescott looks like he's the answer for America's Team, they did lose a considerable amount of talent this offseason. Here are most of the names: cornerbacks Brandon Carr and Morris Claiborne, safeties Barry Church and J.J. Wilcox, running back Lance Dunbar, guard Ronald Leary, and defensive tackle Terrell McClain—not to mention guard Doug Free retiring. Whew. Right now, the Cowboys have Anthony Brown and Nolan Carroll slated to be the opening day starters at the cornerback position. Playing in over 70 percent of the snaps in 2016, Brown played OK, though he surrendered five touchdowns in coverage (tied for fifth-most in the league). Carroll on the other hand is coming off probably the worst season of his career, serving as a starter for the Philadelphia Eagles. In a recent mock draft done by my colleague Matt Miller, he's mocked LSU cornerback Tre'Davious White to the Cowboys so he (or any other first-round cornerback) could be the solution to an ailing cornerback group. Led by Prescott, running back Ezekiel Elliott and wide receiver Dez Bryant , the Cowboys will once again be an NFC favorite despite being one-and-done in the 2016 postseason.  : at Atlanta Falcons (Week 10) This was a close call between the Atlanta Falcons on the road and the Oakland Raiders on the road—both are exceedingly tough matchups, but the Falcons defense and their offense are a tad more complete than the Raiders, but by the narrowest of margins. The Falcons have a fearsome front-seven and a proven, top-tier cornerback in Desmond Truant. It could quite possibly come down to these two teams for who will be the king of the NFC, so buckle up and get ready.  : both games vs. New York Giants (Weeks 1 and 14), vs. Seattle Seahawks (Week 16) 2017 is shaping up to be the year of the New York Giants in terms of the NFC East crown, so wins against them are going to important for the Cowboys. The Giants have a legitimate offense, especially after adding wide receiver Brandon Marshall and their defense is one of the better units (on paper) in the league. It should be a given that wins against a potential division leading foe are in the "prove-it" territory. Next up, the Seattle Seahawks. The Cowboys have the luxury of facing them at home, but they will not be an easy out. A quarterback duel of Prescott and Russell Wilson writes itself—another exciting contest that the Cowboys need too win to prove they're still among the NFC elite.  Denver Broncos (2016 Record: 9-7) Like the Houston Texans, the Denver Broncos were also connected to the Tony Romo rumors. Now that we know that isn't going to work out, the Broncos are left with the same duo as last season at the position: Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch. The Broncos somewhat caught lightning in a bottle with Siemian who wasn't great by any means, but didn't kill them. The biggest issue for the Broncos in 2016 was the offensive line. This offseason, the Broncos addressed that by adding offensive tackle Menelik Watson and guard Ronald Leary. This defense is still one of the better units in the league despite recent losses in free agency and there's no reason to believe that they will be slowing down. Although Siemian is proficient at managing a game, he has limitations. The Broncos are a borderline double-digit win team which is fine considering the division they're in. : vs. New England Patriots (Week 10) You know the deal.  : divisional games against the Kansas City Chiefs (Weeks 8 and 17) and Oakland Raiders (Weeks 4 and 12) It's simple, really: The Broncos have two opponents in their own division that are legitimate threats in the AFC. Where the Broncos are borderline playoff material in a stacked division, their contests against the Raiders and Chiefs will dictate most of what we need to know about this Broncos squad.  Detroit Lions (2016 Record: 9-7) On a personal note, I'd like to see the Detroit Lions succeed. They're always one of those teams that have "fun" pieces, but always get stuck against tough opponents when/if they make the playoffs. For example, in 2016, the had to travel to the Seattle Seahawks. Ouch. An issue for the Lions as of late has been the lack of of a productive running game—quarterback Matthew Stafford can only throw so much (which he tends to more than most other quarterbacks in the league). With Calvin Johnson retiring, the Lions were assumed to take a hit, but they made the playoffs anyway. Speaking of big hits, Stafford took quite a few of those last season, but after the additions of right tackle Ricky Wagner and guard T.J. Lang, the Lions offensive line is shaping up to be a unit that is worth taking note of. As mentioned earlier about Miller's mock, he has the team taking Miami tight end David Njoku—that would be a fun marriage. The Lions will once again be a wild card contender in 2017.  : at New York Giants (Week 2) I've been an advocate (like Paul Heyman is for Brock Lesnar in WWE) for the New York Giants throughout this entire slideshow, so this shouldn't come as a surprise—they're my favorites to be right there with the best of the NFC. On the road against the Giants is going to be no easy task for any team this season.  : at Baltimore Ravens (Week 13), at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Week 14), both games vs. Green Bay Packers (Weeks 9 and 17) The Baltimore Ravens and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are two teams that seem to be around the level of the Lions in terms of wins and losses. For the Bucs, they are another potential low playoff seed that the Lions could need to fend off and the Ravens will be a good measuring stick for the quality of the team the Lions have, especially on the road. The Lions have games against the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, but those are more so "tough" games rather than "prove-it" games. While beating competition that is universally expected to be ahead of you is important, the Bucs and Ravens are two teams that fit in the same tier as the Lions heading into 2017. Lastly, the Packers finished with just a slightly better record than Detroit in 2016, so beating up on them could prove that they are the leaders of the NFC North.  Green Bay Packers (2016 Record: 10-6) With everything squarely on his shoulders, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers still managed to reach the NFC Championship despite a porous secondary and little help from his wide receivers. The Packers offseason involved them losing two key offensive lineman, and T.J. Lang and center J.C. Tretter, and defensive back Micah Hyde. With that comes some good, though, as the Packers signed tight end Martellus Bennett to add to a receiving group that consists of wide receivers Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb —not to mention running back Ty Montgomery. Regardless of their weaknesses, Rodgers will always lead them to the promise land, meaning, they'll exceed expectations because of him—without him who knows where they would be? The NFC North will always be the Packers for the taking as long as Rodgers is around. : at Atlanta Falcons (Week 2) The site of the teams crushing defeat in the NFC Championship game. Yes, this will be their toughest game of the season. Although Rodgers will do his best to stay in this one, their defense needs to figure out some kind of game plan for containing wide receiver Julio Jones and running back Devonta Freeman. Is that possible, though? It may not be. : at Dallas Cowboys (Week 5) and Pittsburgh Steelers (Week 12) , vs. Seattle Seahawks (Week 1) Hosting the Seattle Seahawks will be one of those games that shows us where the NFC is at. Of course, the Packers may have a slight edge, but again, their defense needs to step it up in games such as this one—a game that we could potentially see again later in the season in the playoffs. The Pittsburgh Steelers are somewhat like the Packers in terms of a productive offense led by an elite quarterback (though Rodgers carries his offense) and a defense that could use some work. This could potentially be a high scoring affair. Seeing how the Packers do against a team in the opposite conference will show if the Packers can hang with some of the top teams in the AFC. Lastly, in Dallas. The Packers are familiar with this territory. Remember when they knocked out the No. 1 seeded Cowboys this past postseason? Why can't they do it again?  Houston Texans (2016 Record: 9-7) Let's start with something we can all agree on: Good job by the Houston Texans for getting rid of quarterback Brock Osweiler. Regardless of how they finish this season, that is a move that will allow them as a franchise to hold their head up high for centuries. With Osweiler leaving, that opened up door for the Texans to seduce Tony Romo if/when he were to be released by the Dallas Cowboys. Well, that didn't exactly go to plan. You see, Romo instead signed with CBS Sports. I didn't even know there was a football team called "CBS Sports"? But in all seriousness, the Texans need a quarterback. Sorry, but Tom Savage and Brandon Weeden don't do it for me. Picking at 25 in this years draft, the Texans may not be able to get that quarterback they so desire, but they could always sign Colin Kaepernick —crazy though, huh? The Texans were carried by a quality defense last season. Although defensive end J.J. Watt will be back, the Texans did lose guys like cornerback A.J. Bouye, safety Quintin Demps and linebacker John Simon—some tough losses to say the least. Not making any moves in free agency, the Texans are left with a lateral move at quarterback, a shoddy offensive line and they lost some defensive pieces. This could end up being a tough season for the Texans.  : at New England Patriots (Week 3) If you need me to go into great detail on this, you may be an alien and have just landed on Earth for the first time since you've skipped over the other mentions of games involving the Patriots. Didn't the Texans get shut out last season in New England? Yeah, thought so.  : at Tennessee Titans (Week 13) Staying within the division, the Tennessee Titans seem to be the cream of the crop in the AFC South. If the Texans are able to go into Tennessee and take the win, it will make me (and should make you) look at the Texans differently. This is a game I've got them losing.  Indianapolis Colts (2016 Record: 8-8) The Indianapolis Colts have seemingly been stuck in some odd purgatory for the past couple of seasons. By purgatory, I mean stuck at 8-8 in both 2015 and 2016. We're all pretty sure that their quarterback, Andrew Luck is a pretty good quarterback (though he's had some injuries here recently). This needs to be noted because the Colts have had a pretty bad defense recently—not to mention some of the worst draft classes in what seems like forever. This offseason, they cut ties with their former general manager Ryan Grigson, who has been responsible for poor transactional decisions such as drafting defensive end Bjorn Werner in 2013, drafting wide receiver Phillip Dorsett in 2015, trading a first round pick for running back Trent Richardson and so on. After parting ways with him, the Colts moved on to free agency and they made some quality acquisitions such as linebacker John Simon, defensive end Jabaal Sheard, wide receiver Kamar Aiken, linebacker Barkevious Mingo, nose tackle Al Woods, linebacker Sean Spence, the newly signed nose tackle Jonathan Hankins and the re-signing of defensive back Darius Butler. This is the Tennessee Titans year, though. They have all the pieces to lead the AFC South, but the Colts aren't far behind because of Luck. In 2016, the Colts had one of the worst pass blocking offensive lines in the sport, according to PFF —that doesn't exactly help to keep Luck upright. The Colts still have some work to do, but with Grigson out of the picture, the Colts are trending back towards their 11-5 form from 2014.  : at Seattle Seahawks (Week 4) Going into Seattle is always a tough task. This is right up there with going into Foxboro in terms of environment—of course they level of play from the home team is different. It doesn't matter who you are, or what team you play for—going into CenturyLink Field is no small task. Need I say more?  : at Baltimore Ravens (Week 16), at Tennessee Titans (Week 12) If the Colts are able to go into Tennessee and beat my presumed favorite in the AFC South—the Titans—they could potentially push them for the division crown. The Titans are a solid team all around heading into 2017 with wide receiver being the only real concern. If they're able to address that in the draft (which they should and most likely will) this is set up to be a tough game for the Colts and Luck. Looking at the Ravens, they're a lot like the Colts this year and vice-versa in terms of where they are in the football landscape. They're both likely the second best team in their respective divisions and should be in the Wild Card hunt. A win in Baltimore will definitely make the Colts look like a more serious contender for a low wild card seed. Jacksonville Jaguars (2016 Record: 3-13) Another offseason of heavy spending is setting up the Jacksonville Jaguars to be the interesting team heading into the season for the second year in a row. This year, the Jags splurged heavily on guys like cornerback A.J. Bouye, defensive lineman Calais Campbell and safety Barry Church. Currently, their defense is set up to be one of the better units on paper, but as we saw in the 2016, that didn't translate totally. On the offensive side of the ball, the offensive line has been a concern and it appears it will remain that way after losing offensive tackle Kelvin Beachum and guard Luke Joeckel. No, neither one of those guys were anything to rave about, but that's the issue—they're set to roll with an offensive line consisting of: Branden Albert, Patrick Omameh, Brandon Linder, AJ Cann and Jeremy Parnell (left tackle to right tackle, respectively). Adding Albert will hopefully be a boost. At the skill positions, the Jaguars have some exciting receivers in Allen Robinson, Marqise Lee and Allen Hurns. However, their tight end group—Marcedes Lewis, Neal Sterling, Ben Koyack and Mychal Rivera—is far from the best in the league. Running back is a bit of a concern in terms of consistent production, but there have been plenty of mock drafts placing LSU's Leonard Fournette here, so that would be an exceptional add for the squad. My issue lies with quarterback Blake Bortles, though. I'm almost convinced he's not the answer in Jacksonville. Because of him, the team may be held back. Hopefully Bortles is able to prove me wrong because football would be a lot more fun if teams like the Jags were competitive—their defense is certainly poised to be a good one.  : at Pittsburgh Steelers (Week 5)  : every game against divisional opponents (Weeks 1, 2, 7, 13, 15, 17) The AFC South is perhaps the most mediocre in football in terms of who could win it. Sure, the teams are up and coming, but this division should once again be up for grabs. It's simple: If the Jaguars can beat their division opponents, they'll prove me and my projected 6-10 record wrong. Win your division games and you'll be set up for success, Jacksonville.  Kansas City Chiefs (2016 Record: 12-4) Whatever your opinion is on the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith, this team continues to win ball games. After a two-point loss in the playoffs, the Chiefs head back in to 2017 as one of the premier teams in the AFC. With their stadium rockin', Arrowhead will continue to be one of the most daunting places in the world for visiting teams to play in. Not a lot went on this offseason for the Chiefs in terms of additions and losses, though they did finally cut ties with running back Jamaal Charles . The most notable loss was nose tackle Dontari Poe, but Poe had been struggling as of late. Still, a loss nonetheless. In a division with the Oakland Raiders, the Chiefs may not be division champs this year, but a wild card spot is definitely one of theirs for the taking.  : at New England Patriots (Week 1) New England alert.  : games against the Raiders (Weeks 7 and 14), vs. Pittsburgh Steelers (Week 6) As mentioned earlier, the Chiefs will be competing for the division crown against the Raiders. Beating them could ultimately mean the difference between being a five or six seed versus a one, two, three, or even four seed. These are highly important games for the Chiefs. Beyond the division, a rematch with the Steelers is a prove-it game. Not only for a potential "W", but some revenge on the team that beat them last season. A win against the Steelers would be a definite confidence boost. And hey, who knows? Maybe we'll see Chiefs and Steelers Round 2 in the postseason.  Los Angeles Chargers (2016 Record: 5-11) In their first season away from good ol' Qualcomm Stadium, the newly branded Los Angeles Chargers will have the luxury of playing at—a soccer stadium? Yeah, the Chargers will be using the LA Galaxy's field for the 2017 season, which that in and of itself should be quite interesting. Looking at the Chargers schedule, they have some really difficult games this season. Outside of their own division (in which every team should be at .500 or better), the Chargers take on teams like the New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants. The Chargers offseason kicked off by releasing cornerback Brandon Flowers, guard D.J. Fluker and wide receiver Stevie Johnson. As the offseason went on, they eventually parted with offensive tackle King Dunlap. Beyond that, the Chargers re-signed safety Jahleel Addae, brought in offensive tackle Russell Okung, and watched running back Danny Woodhead head to Baltimore. The biggest issue with the Chargers has always been in the trenches, which is still an issue, especially on the offensive side. However, with quarterback Philip Rivers, wide receivers Tyrell Williams and Keenan Allen (assuming he's healthy), running back Melvin Gordon and the defensive Phenom Joey Bosa, the Chargers could be a tough out in 2017.  : at New England Patriots (Week 8) You know the deal.  : all division games (Weeks 1, 3, 6, 7, 15, 17) As mentioned above, the AFC West is going to be loaded with teams that finish with winning records. The division also holds two teams (the Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs) that are two of the best in the AFC. While there may be increased familiarity because they are all in the same division, the Chargers could put their imprint on this season by taking out their own divisional foes. The Chargers have a pretty good team, but their division could be what ultimately holds them back.  Los Angeles Rams (2016 Record: 4-12) 2017 is shaping up to be another snooze fest for the Los Angeles Rams, but let me say this: They did a nice job signing offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth—a veteran presence to protect their young quarterback, Jared Goff's, blindside. Outside of that, I'm not really sure what else to say about the team. They lost their best wide receiver in Kenny Britt, but did bring in former Buffalo Bills wideout Robert Woods. Still, not enough. This offense is shaping up to be one of the worst in the league, barring a resurgence from running back Todd Gurley. Let's just get this over with—the Rams are screwed. And bad.  : at New York Giants (Week 9) Almost on par with their road trip to Dallas, the Giants take the cake here for the same reason I've been preaching throughout this slideshow: They're my favorite to win the NFC East. Their defense should gobble up Goff and stop any momentum Gurley could possibly have.  : both games against San Francisco 49ers (Weeks 3 and 17) These games will be to simply prove which team is worse. That's it.  Miami Dolphins (2016 Record: 10-6) As a personal truther of Miami Dolphins running back Jay Ajayi, I'd love for the Dolphins to do well in 2017. One problem, though: their schedule is quite difficult this season. With that said, the Dolphins did make believers out of a lot of people before quarterback Ryan Tannehill went down with a knee injury which left the Dolphins to use backup quarterback and veteran Matt Moore against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Dolphins did do a nice job in free agency overall, though, bringing back wide receiver Kenny Stills and bringing in guys like safety T.J. McDonald and linebacker Lawrence Timmons. The offensive line is still an issue that the Dolphins need to address, but the rest of the offense is looking competitive with Tannehill, Ajayi, wide receivers Jarvis Landry, DeVante Parker and Kenny Stills—not to mention they brought in tight end Julius Thomas. Hopefully the Dolphins can build off of their 2016 momentum—their schedule is far from a cake-walk.  : at Atlanta Falcons (Week 6) The only reason their games against New England aren't here is because they play in same division—same deal as the Buffalo Bills. So, instead, they're hardest opponent will be that other Super bowl team, the Atlanta Falcons, who they will play on the road. Between the Falcons offense and the Falcons front seven against this pedestrian offensive line the Dolphins have, it's setting up to be a long day at the office for Tannehill and company.  : vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Week 1), vs. Denver Broncos (Week 13) The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Denver Broncos are two teams that are are close in terms of where they could land in 2017. Sure, I'm projecting the Dolphins to be worse than both of those teams, but they just have a tough schedule compared to them. Looking at the Bucs, not only are they that other team in Florida, but they'll be a nice challenge for the Dolphins, but totally beatable. Knocking off a potential wild card team in the NFC will pay huge dividends for the Dolphins. The same logic kind of applies to the Broncos here, too. Not only will they have a rematch against their former defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, but the Broncos and Dolphins are two teams that could make their way into the sixth seed in the AFC. Knocking off the Broncos could end up being the difference between them making the playoffs or not, even though I'm projecting a 7-9 record.  Minnesota Vikings (2016 Record: 8-8) After starting off 2016 to the tune of a 5-0 record, the Minnesota Vikings totally plummeted, losing eight of their next 11 games. What was the catalyst for the Vikings failures? Offensive line woes. Sure, Sam Bradford isn't the greatest quarterback in the league, but the Vikings offensive line was just awful—it seemed like they used 18 million different combinations and none of them were any good. It's clear the Vikings brass noticed as they brought in two offensive tackles: Riley Reiff and Mike Remmers. 2016 was also the final season of the Adrian Peterson era. As a result, the Vikings picked up former Oakland Raiders running back Latavius Murray to fill the void. With additions, there are subtractions, of course, but for the Vikings, they didn't really lose anyone all that important—all replaceable. The Vikings are a very average team in a pretty tough division headed by the Green Bay Packers with the Detroit Lions right there, too. Fortunately, the Chicago Bears are in the same division, too.  : at Atlanta Falcons (Week 13) This was a tough call, between the Atlanta Falcons and Pittsburgh Steelers, but the Falcons have just as good an offense (if not better) than the Steelers and their defense is better, too. The defending NFC champs will give this Vikings new-look offensive line all they can handle while their quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones obliterate this Vikings defense.  : vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Week 3) The Tampa Bay Buccaneers at home is a game the Minnesota Vikings can win, but they present an interesting challenge. Led by guys like cornerback Xavier Rhodes, the Vikings should be able to create some issues for Bucs quarterback Jameis Winston. However, the Bucs pass rush consisting of Gerald McCoy, Chris Baker, William Gholston, Robert Ayers (among others) will likely give the Vikings trouble—their offensive line is still far from perfect. A win over the Vikings would show they can overcome adversity, while winning a game against a team that is around the same ballpark as them, if not slightly ahead.  New England Patriots (2016 Record: 14-2) What can one say about the New England Patriots at this point? They're just not stoppable. Just when you think they can't get any better, they go out and acquire wide receiver Brandin Cooks, sign cornerback Stephon Gilmore, trade for tight end Dwayne Allen and re-sign linebacker Dont'a Hightower. Not only that, but there have been some rumors surrounding the Patriots acquiring Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman. However, those were later walked back a little bit, according to Tom Curran of . But you never know—if the Patriots do part ways with cornerback Malcolm Mitchell, I wouldn't count the Patriots out of anything at this point. Brady is the GOAT and they are the definite favorites. I may have them at 14-2, but I won't be surprised at all if they go 16-0.  : "at" Oakland Raiders (Week 13) We haven't seen this matchup yet—the Raiders and Patriots. The only thing that would make this even more difficult would be in Oakland, but instead this game will be played in Mexico City where the altitude is, like, a million feet above sea level. With that said, the Patriots will still be tested by the Raiders and their young stud at quarterback in Derek Carr. If all goes according to plan, the Raiders should be sporting Marshawn Lynch at running back in 2017, so that will be a tough train to stop—in case you needed any reminder of how nasty a running back Lynch is, watch this . The Patriots also have a tough game against Pittsburgh, but they're a bit more familiar with them than they are the Raiders. This is definitely a game the Patriots could lose.  : None What have they got to prove? They're going to kill us all.  New Orleans Saints (2016 Record: 7-9) Oh, the New Orleans Saints. Seems to be the same thing every season, am I right? Great offense, quarterback Drew Brees, lame defense. 2017 is shaping up to be the same way, but there are a few new twists. Starting with the offense, the Saints traded wide receiver Brandin Cooks to the New England Patriots. As a result, the Saints now sport a core of receivers that consists of Michael Thomas, Brandon Coleman, Willie Snead and a new member, Ted Ginn Jr. On defense, the Saints are relatively the same—headlined with defensive linemen Sheldon Rankins and Cameron Jordan. The Saints did, however, add Manti Te'o in free agency. Te'o may not be the only new acquisition on defense, though. With Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler signing his restricted free agent tag, the Patriots and Saints can now work out a trade—this would definitely, definitely, help the Saints porous secondary. Going off of what we have now, the Saints offense is as good as any, but their defense will not help them out—six of their nine losses in 2016 came in games in which the offense put up 20 or more points. The Saints are set up for a similar fate in 2017.  : vs. New England Patriots (Week 2) The good news is this game is at home. The bad news is it doesn't matter. New England alert.  : vs. Detroit Lions (Week 6), at Green Bay Packers (Week 7), division games (Weeks 3, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17) This may seem like a strange list, and it is. What makes the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers games marked as "prove-it" games for a team projected to go 7-9 is that these games are going to come down to whoever can score more points. I'd project that the Saints don't win either of these games, but they very well could. As mentioned before, the Saints lost six games in 2016 scoring 20 or more points. Essentially every team on their schedule that is terrible is a prove-it game since the Saints will go as far as this offense takes them. If their defense can maybe force a three and out every now and again, that'd be nice.  New York Giants (2016 Record: 11-5) Selling fake memorabilia or not, quarterback Eli Manning and the New York Giants chances in 2017 are 100 percent authentic (what an awful joke). As my favorite to win the NFC East, the Giants have all the pieces (outside of an offensive line maybe) for a legitimate Super Bowl run. During this offseason, the Giants haven't made plenty of moves, but by far the most notable was the acquisition of wide receiver Brandon Marshall. A squad consisting of Marshall, Odell Beckham Jr. and Sterling Shepard is enough to make anyone's mouth water. With Manning at quarterback, all of these guys should be properly fed. The offensive line is a definite concern, but there are two good pieces in Justin Pugh and Weston Richburg. To solve this, number one, the Giants need to get rid of left tackle Ereck Flowers—he's just not good at this whole left tackle thing. Number two, address this in the draft. The Giants did go out and sign guard D.J. Fluker, but that shouldn't necessarily excite anyone. Looking at the Giants defense, they did lose nose tackle Jonathan Hankins, but the rest of the defense is absolutely rock solid. The Giants did go 11-5 last season, so a 13-3 season is totally unimaginable, but winning the division after what we saw from Dallas last season? That could be, but guess what? They're winning it. Vault me. Your new NFC East champs, the Giants. PS: No, I'm not a Giants fan, so back off.  : at Oakland Raiders (Week 13) Playing out of the division, against a team that they only play every four years, the Giants will have quite the task when they take to the road to take on the Oakland Raiders. Both teams have solid offenses, though the Giants have the better defense all around (though the Raiders do have Khalil Mack). This will be a hard, tough fought game until the end with two teams that we could potentially see in the Super Bowl.  : games against Dallas Cowboys (Weeks 1 and 14), vs. Seattle Seahawks (Week 7) and Kansas City (Week 11) One thing all the teams listed above have in common? They're all perennial playoff teams. Winning games against teams like the Cowboys, Chiefs and Seahawks will prove that the Giants are a forced to be reckoned with—like I think they are. Beating Dallas also gives them a better shot at winning the division, too.  New York Jets (2016 Record: 5-11) Yikes. Where. To. Begin. Look fellas, the New York Jets are awful. Probably worse than the Browns in all honesty. This past offseason they cut ties with wide receiver Brandon Marshall and cornerback Darrelle Revis. Not only that but they're most likely going to try to trade linebacker Sheldon Richardson, too. Outside of Eric Decker , the wide receiver position is really below average. The tight end position has been non-existent for what feels like 10 years. The running game is OK with Matt Forte , but he's getting older. On defense they have some players in cornerback Morris Claiborne, defensive ends Muhammad Wilkerson and Leonard Williams and linebacker Darron Lee (who struggled a good deal in 2016), but it will not be shocking if these guys just end up giving up—they're not going to win many games (if any) led by quarterback Josh McCown. All the credit in the world to the guy, but he's aging, he gets beat up and he's really just a game manager if that. Godspeed, Jets.  : at New England Patriots (Week 17) They may be a divisional opponent, but at least they might be able to move the ball over midfield against a few other teams. This is going to by ugly.  : at Cleveland Browns (Week 5) This game will be to show that they have a pulse. That's all. Please be on primetime.  Oakland Raiders (2016 Record: 12-4) After a devastating end that was the broken leg of quarterback Derek Carr, the Oakland Raiders hope to regroup and maintain the success from a year ago. The whole crew is basically back together, but there was some movement in free agency. On the departing end, the Raiders said goodbye to notable players like linebacker Malcolm Smith, Latavius Murray, Menelik Watson and Nate Allen. But on the receiving end, the Raiders welcomed tight end Jared Cook, offensive tackle Marshall Newhouse and wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson. Pretty soon, we'll be able to add running back Marshawn Lynch's name to the additions list, barring any unforeseen potholes in talks between the Seattle Seahawks and Raiders. Not much else to say besides "Just win, baby."  : vs. New England Patriots (Week 11) New England alert, but this is actually a game the Raiders could win and no one should be surprised. We'll finally get the game we were all hoping for in the AFC championship when these two teams collide.  : games against the Kansas City Chiefs (Weeks 7 and 14), vs. Dallas Cowboys (Week 15) The Raiders don't have much to prove besides who the better team in the AFC West is. If Carr is able to stay healthy the entire season, the Raiders should overtake the AFC West with no issue. I threw in the Cowboys for the fun of it simply because beating good teams is a sign of "proving it." All in all, the Raiders don't have much else to prove—they're a great team.  Philadelphia Eagles (2016 Record: 7-9) A potential sneaky team in 2017, the Philadelphia Eagles actually have a decent roster. During this offseason the Eagles made it a point to upgrade their wide receivers and did so in signing former San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Torrey Smith and former Chicago Bear Alshon Jeffery. Now, at quarterback Carson Wentz's disposal, he'll have an offense featuring Jeffery, Smith, wide receiver Jordan Matthews, tight end Zach Ertz and running backs Ryan Mathews, Wendell Smallwood and Darren Sproles . The offensive line is no different from last season and according to PFF , ranked inside the top-nine in both run and pass blocking and also acquired guard Chance Warmack this offseason. Two other moves the Eagles made this offseason came on the defensive side of the ball in acquiring defensive tackle Timmy Jernigan from the Baltimore Ravens and signing defensive end Chris Long. While the Eagles' front-seven looks appealing, their secondary—comprised of cornerbacks Jalen Mills and Patrick Robinson and safeties Rodney McLeod and Malcolm Jenkins—does need some work. Unfortunately for the Eagles, they're in a defense with the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants—two teams I expect to be right in the thick of things in the NFC playoff hunt. On paper the Eagles have the potential to surprise a lot of us, but a lot of it will fall on the shoulders of their North Dakota State product in this second season in the NFL. The Eagles being good (like the first three games of 2016 win/loss wise) would be fun, but can they beat the Cowboys and/or Giants? Targeting a cornerback or maybe even former Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey (if he's still available) in the first round is the way to go for Philly.  : at Seattle Seahawks (Week 13) The Seattle Seahawks game may not be the most difficult opponent on the schedule in terms of project win-loss records (they're at home against the Oakland Raiders), but the environment is what is going to make this game more difficult than one at home against the Raiders. Seattle is still one of the most difficult places to play, so this shouldn't come as a surprise whatsoever—how will Wentz deal with the noise? North Dakota was never this loud, I assure you.  : vs. Denver Broncos (Week 9) and Arizona Cardinals (Week 5), games against the Cowboys (Weeks 11 and 17) and Giants (Weeks 3 and 15) For the Eagles to prove they are in a class higher than what is projected here, taking care of business at home against teams like the Denver Broncos and Arizona Cardinals will do that. Both the Broncos and Cardinals are second place/borderline second place teams in their respective divisions and have multiple pieces that can lead a playoff run. The Eagles aren't quite there for me yet. Splitting the games would be nice, though. Maybe the Eagles can get off to a similar start like last year and just maintain it? With the Cowboys and Giants projected here to be the leaders of this division, wins over them would be very telling in terms of where this division could be headed.  Pittsburgh Steelers (2016 Record: 11-5) The Pittsburgh Steelers have some issues defensively. We know that. Nonetheless, their offense is absolutely dynamite. Sporting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, running back Le'Veon Bell, wide receiver Antonio Brown and Eli Rogers and also tight ends Jesse James and Ladarius Green, the Steelers still managed an 11-5 record. In 2017, the Steelers will re-add an old friend: Wide receiver Martavis Bryant. All in all, the Steelers didn't lose or gain much in free agency, though they did strike out on signing a cornerback. With Bryant back in the fold as well as what is already existent on the team, the Steelers should make their way back to a double-digit win franchise.  : vs. New England Patriots (Week 15) It's the damn Patriots again—they're everywhere, killing everyone. And who knows, by the time this game rolls around, they could have running back Marshawn Lynch, cornerback Richard Sherman, and hell, maybe even wide receiver Calvin Johnson will un-retire. Joking, of course. They already have a stacked roster, but this game is winnable for the Steelers as their offense can definitely go toe-to-toe with the Patriots'. Show us what you got, Big Ben.  : vs. Green Bay Packers (Week 12) While Tom Brady and the New England Patriots may be the cream of the crop, the Green Bay Packers are not too far behind. We all know the Steelers are on the fringe of being an elite football team today, but in order for the football world to truly take them seriously, a win over the Green Bay Packers, an NFC opponent, would help legitimize their image as a serious threat. Of course, a win over the Patriots would do the same thing, but an opponent in another conference is just as important—especially where it's the Packers.  San Francisco 49ers (2016 Record: 2-14) After just one season as head coach, the San Francisco 49ers gave Chip Kelly the boot in brought in Kyler Shanahan to take over at the same position. In addition to Shanahan, the 49ers also brought in former Fox Sports analyst John Lynch as their new general manager, replacing Trent Baalke. The 49ers are turning over a new leaf and they are in great hands with Shanahan at the helm as he has made pretty much every stop in his career a success. With quarterback Colin Kaepernick declining his team option, the 49ers are (still) searching for a new franchise quarterback, but in the mean time, they did bring in Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley. With the No. 2 overall pick in the upcoming NFL draft, many would speculate that the 49ers take a quarterback here. Assuming Cleveland goes with Texas A&M's Myles Garrett, the 49ers have their pick of anyone in the draft—or do they wait and get a guy like Patrick Mahomes or DeShone Kizer later? Another move is drafting other defensive guys like Alabama's Jonathan Allen or Stanford's Solomon Thomas. In free agency, the 49ers also managed to snag wide receiver Pierre Garçon who should be a valuable target for whoever is the teams quarterback in 2017 after losing Torrey Smith. Also, who can forget about running back Carlos Hyde? This is a team that needs a lot of work, but with Shanahan running the show, the 49ers direction can only go in a positive way. I mean, can it really get any worse?  : vs. New York Giants (Week 10) Hosting both the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants this season, the 49ers already have two losses on the schedule right there. The Giants defense is simply going to man-handle whoever the 49ers throw out there at quarterback. This is going to be a slobber-knocker.  : both games vs. Los Angeles Rams (Weeks 3 and 17), at Chicago Bears (Week 13) Which of these three is the worst team? Find out in 2017! (Oh wait, it's probably the New York Jets).  Seattle Seahawks (2016 Record: 10-5-1) It's impossible to talk about the Seattle Seahawks without addressing this seemingly odd situation surrounding star cornerback Richard Sherman. If you're not familiar, the Seahawks have publicly stated, according to Bob Condotta of the that they have been shopping the 29-year-old. Isn't that odd? It's not often we hear a franchise come out and publicly state that they are shopping who some would consider the catalyst for a lot of the Seahawks success in the recent years. After Sherman, the Seahawks seem prepared and likely to trade running back Marshawn Lynch to the Oakland Raiders. Speaking of running backs, the Seahawks signed Eddie Lacy , formerly of the Green Bay Packers, to join a backfield that consists of Thomas Rawls, C.J. Prosise and Alex Collins. After a season-ending injury, the Seahawks also brought back cornerback DeShawn Shead (had to throw that out there). The biggest issue with the Seahawks has been and still is the offensive line. With all the success and pedigree surrounding the Seahawks recently, it's so odd that their offensive line consists of players like Luke Joeckel (newly-added), Mark Glowinski, Justin Britt, Germain Ifedi (well actually, he's OK) and Oday Aboushi—yes I had to look some of these names up. Remember last year when George Fant was their left tackle? The hell is going on? Seahawks, get some offensive lineman. We know quarterback Russell Wilson can run, but for the love of God make it so he's running to make a play and not for his life! With Wilson, though, the Seahawks should be another contender in 2017 (draft a lineman!).  : at New York Giants (Week 7) The Seahawks have three other opponents that could be listed here outside the Giants (Dallas Cowboys, Green Bay Packers, Atlanta Falcons). Combining the road trip with projected wins and losses the Giants win here. Not only that, but they have the toughest defense among the four teams and have the best chance at chasing down Wilson. Furthermore, passing against guys like cornerback Janoris Jenkins and safety Landon Collins could be quite difficult to do. Giants on the road is set up the be a difficult game, but on the road against Dallas is a close second.  : at Green Bay Packers (Week 1), vs. Atlanta Falcons (Week 11) Games against two of the NFC's elite will demonstrate how good a Seahawks team we actually have. With the Sherman rumors fluttering, it's easy to point the finger on locker room turmoil if things go south. These are two games the Seahawks could very well win, but also could their opponents. The Falcons have to play in Seattle and while Seattle may be on the road in Lambeau Field, their defense stinks. These three teams will likely all land in the playoffs, taking them out proves who in the NFC is among the most powerful.  Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2016 Record: 9-7) We are entering year three of the Jameis Winston experience as the quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and so far it's been a healthy evolution, going from 6-10 his rookie season to 9-7 in his sophomore year. The Bucs have an exciting team, especially with the new additions of wide receiver DeSean Jackson defensive end Chris Baker and safety J.J. Wilcox. Fortunately, the Bucs didn't lose a ton this offseason, but backup quarterback Mike Glennon did flee to the Chicago Bears for quite the payday and a chance to start. With Jackson joining fellow receiver Mike Evans and the Bucs have tight end Cameron Brate and wide receiver Adam Humphries also at Winston's exposure, we have the makings of what could be a somewhat-high-powered offense. Jackson's deep threat ability will make opposing defenses move away from doubling Evans, giving him more one-on-one matchups (or so I'd think). Adding Baker to a defensive line that includes Williams Gholston, Gerald McCoy and Robert Ayers should also excite Bucs fans. The biggest issue the Bucs have—like most teams—is their offensive line. No, it's not Seattle Seahawks bad, but they just need more consistency from guys like Ali Marpet, Donovan Smith and Joe Hawley. Drafting another tight end to potentially pair with Brate is also another good idea. The Bucs are arguably the second-best team in the NFC South behinds the Falcons and with the additions of Jackson and Baker, the Bucs could be a tough out down the stretch and especially at home.  : vs. New England Patriots (Week 5) Very excited for this game for the sheer fact of seeing Winston go up against New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. The Patriots should most definitely win this game, but let's at least hope it's entertaining.  : games against the Carolina Panthers (Weeks 8 and 16) and vs. Detroit Lions (Week 14) The Panthers should be an improved ball club in 2017, so holding them at bay is a must in a division expected to be ran by the Atlanta Falcons—make the wild card at least! The Lions present a fun challenge, too, as the Bucs pass rush against a newly formed Lions offense line should be an interesting battle. On offense the Bucs have a slight edge, but Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford can throw and throw and throw until his arm falls off. If after the draft or during the draft the Lions draft someone to establish a real running game, this game could even be more tightly contested.  Tennessee Titans (2016 Record: 9-7) This is it. This is finally it. This is the year the Tennessee Titans finally make the playoffs. Not only that, but they're going to win double-digit games this season. They have plenty of quality pieces from their quarterback Marcus Mariota to their linebacker, Wesley Woodyard. However, the Titans did just cut ties with veteran cornerback Jason McCourty, though, so that will be a need a they will have to address in the draft. Speaking of the draft, the Titans hold two picks in the first round—fifth and 18th overall. With their fifth pick, guys like Marshon Lattimore and teammate Gareon Conley from Ohio State could be options—maybe even Kevin King from Washington? After that, we could see options like Marlon Humphrey out of Alabama or they could take the injured Sidney Jones later—you get it, plenty of cornerback options with some better than others. They biggest need for the Titans appears to be wide receivers, which they can address with the 18th overall selection. Call me crazy, but the Titans could be a legitimate threat this season. Get excited.  : at Pittsburgh Steelers (Week 11) Though the Titans have a few tough opponents this year (just look at the "prove-it games" section), on the road, in Pittsburgh, is no easy task. For those other games, the Titans have the luxury of being at home. The Steelers offense is one of the more feared units in the game. It's time for the Titans to hang with the big guns this season (big guns? What a terrible cliché).  : vs. Seattle Seahawks (Week 3), vs. Oakland Raiders (Week 1) Both of these games are within two weeks of one another—a tough start for the Titans. In 2016, the Titans fell at home to the Oakland Raiders by a touchdown. This year, they'll need to at least split against the Raiders and Seahawks at home. I know, I know, they're far from slouches, but the Titans had wins over the Green Bay Packers at home and the Kansas City Chiefs on the road last season. To be taken seriously in a conference that is simply ran by the New England Patriots, knocking off the Seahawks and/or the Raiders will show that the Titans are a serious threat. Washington Redskins (2016 Record: 8-7-1) In terms of top free agents this offseason, the Washington Redskins were involved with many of them one way or another. On the departing end, the Redskins lost defensive end Chris Baker and wide receiver DeSean Jackson to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and wide receiver Pierre Garçon to the San Francisco 49ers. On the acquiring end, the Redskins brought in wide receiver Terrelle Pryor on a one-year deal to pair with second-year receiver Josh Docston and linebacker Zach Brown, who was second in the league in tackles for the Buffalo Bills in 2016 with 149 . However, the biggest storyline surrounding the Redskins this offseason was the saga that is quarterback Kirk Cousins and an apparent rift with the team. After being franchise-tagged, there were multiple reports of Cousins asking owner Dan Snyder directly about a trade, though Cousins later came out and said that those reports were never true. I think we can all figure it out—barring a miracle, we will not see Cousins on the Redskins in 2018 and who knows? He could very well be traded at the draft. If he does remain with the team in 2017, though, this is likely it for the Cousins era. A year ago, the Redskins went 8-8. Say what you want, but this apparent controversy could play a role in the regression of the team, whether it be in the locker room or whatever. Not only that, but the Redskins do have quite a tough slate of opponents. Perhaps the most obvious is their division—the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles.

In terms of top free agents this offseason, the Washington Redskins were involved with many of them one way or another.

On the departing end, the Redskins lost defensive end Chris Baker and wide receiver DeSean Jackson to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and wide receiver Pierre Garçon to the San Francisco 49ers.

On the acquiring end, the Redskins brought in wide receiver Terrelle Pryor on a one-year deal to pair with second-year receiver Josh Docston and linebacker Zach Brown, who was second in the league in tackles for the Buffalo Bills in 2016 with 149.

However, the biggest storyline surrounding the Redskins this offseason was the saga that is quarterback Kirk Cousins and an apparent rift with the team.

After being franchise-tagged, there were multiple reports of Cousins asking owner Dan Snyder directly about a trade, though Cousins later came out and said that those reports were never true.

I think we can all figure it out—barring a miracle, we will not see Cousins on the Redskins in 2018 and who knows? He could very well be traded at the draft. If he does remain with the team in 2017, though, this is likely it for the Cousins era.

A year ago, the Redskins went 8-8. Say what you want, but this apparent controversy could play a role in the regression of the team, whether it be in the locker room or whatever. Not only that, but the Redskins do have quite a tough slate of opponents.

Perhaps the most obvious is their division—the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. That sounds like quite a few losses to me.

Beyond that, they play against teams like the Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, Seattle Seahawks and also play against the New Orleans Saints in New Orleans—all tough matchups.

Don't be surprised the Redskins to have a tougher go of it in 2017 than in 2016.

Toughest game: at Seattle Seahawks (Week 9)

Prove-it games: division games (Weeks 1, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17), vs. Denver Broncos (Week 16)
