It's almost time for Hollywood's biggest night!

But before the 2017 Oscars begin at 8:30PM ET, the stars will be out on the red carpet.

Expect Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling to dazzle -- their film La La Land is up for 14 awards. And Meryl Streep, who is nominated for her work in Florence Foster Jenkins, always stuns. And we can't wait to see Justin Timberlake, John Legend, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Sting -- who are all performing at the ceremony.

Watch for all the fashion and fun on ABC.com beginning at 7PM ET.

Then stay tuned to Billboard.com for completeÂ coverage of the 89th annual Academy Awards, including winners, performances and more.
