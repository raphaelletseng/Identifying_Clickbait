12 Artists We Can't Wait to See at Coachella  by   FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS  Coachella 2017 is almost here, and as always, the cream-of-the-crop festival has tonsÂ of incredible music lined up for those who have tickets to either weekend. With so many notable names on the bill, it's hard for us at to not be thrilled about just about everyone who will be there. In looking at the roster, though, there are a few names that stand out as artists we really can't wait to see, whether it's because they're legendary, they have new music to perform, or they're promising up-and-comers. Take a look at who we're most looking forward to seeing in Indio.  The alt-R&B-meets-pop group knows how to bring people together with their eclectic, synth-heavy jams. Sure, Kanye West, Chance the Rapper and Bon Iver are supporters, but frontman Francis Farewell Starlite & co.'s knack for piecing together diverse melodies make the crew a sight to see. The sibling duo hailing from New Zealand has made waves with their electro-pop jams like "Free" and "Bridges," with Georgia NottÂ taking lead on vocals and her multi-instrumentalist brother Caleb providing the bumping background sounds.Â While they're not strangers to the festival scene, Coachella is perhaps the biggest stage they've taken yet -- so they likely won't be holding anything back. Sampha's mood music will bring the soul to Coachella's diverse lineup. The Drake- and BeyoncÃ©-approved crooner's recently released album is sure to bring the instant feels (especially with deep cuts like "(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano" and "Timmy's Prayer") when attendees need a break from the turn-up. Considering the rock band's absence and the general demographic of Coachella, the fest will likely serve as the first Radiohead experience for thousands in attendance.Â Above all, though, aÂ festival setting is definitely the prime place to hear Thom Yorke and co. deliver their eerie rock tunes.Â And a festival in the California desert? Talk about a perfect situation. By now, it's no secret that Coachella is the breeding ground for some insane surprises. And with the star-studded roster DJ Snake has racked up with his handful of hits -- Justin Bieber,Â AlunaGeorge, Lil Jon and Migos, to name a few -- there's definitely a chance for a guest appearance or two.Â Seeing a DJ at a festival is exciting enough, but if said DJ brings out one (or several) of his famous friends during their set, that'd make for one exciting time. Â Any follower of the trap baptist knows Future brings his Hive to church during his live performances. After accomplishing the historic feat of landing back-to-back consecutive No. 1 albums earlier this year with and , respectively, the Atlanta hitmaker has more than enough material to heat up the desert. Unlike DJ Snake, Gryffin doesn't have an album's worth of his ownÂ materialÂ to play during his 50-minute set. Yet, the New York City-based DJ delivered a number of dance-worthy singles that are sure to make any festivalgoerÂ bust a move, and he's done a masterful job at remixingÂ hits like Tove Lo's "Talking Body"Â and "Surprise Yourself" by Jack GarrattÂ -- both of whom will be at Coachella, so you never know what surprisesÂ GryffinÂ could have up his sleeve. For 'Chella-goers craving alternative rock mashed with hip-hop, Banks & Steelz -- the duo comprised of Interpol frontman Paul Banks and Wu-Tang Clan's RZA -- will deliver the best of both worlds. Their collaborative debut not only carries the standouts "Giant" and "Love and War," it also features contributions from Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Florence and the Machine's Florence Welch, which -- fingers crossed -- means a surprise-filled set.  Â Her 2016 offering delivered finger-snappin' electronic R&B gems like the lead single "Bad Blood" and other highlights like "Get to Know Ya" and "Adore You." The British singer-songwriter's sweet vocals are sure to lure attendees into a body-roll party. It's not every day you see a famous composer at a music festival, and if there's one who would serve as a must-see, it's the guy behind classic film scores from the likes ofÂ ,Â and .Â C'mon, whoÂ wouldn'tÂ want to seeÂ Â performed live, by the original composer, right in front of their eyes? While she has gifted us with a couple of new tracks from her forthcoming album, as well as a live performance of both, Coachella marks Lorde's first concert since beginning her comeback. Whether that means those in attendance will get the chance to see the live debut of more new material, witnessing "GreenÂ Light" and "Liability" (and frankly, just Lorde's presence in general)Â in person is pretty frickin' exciting. When the rap god touches the stage on Sunday night, his new album will be about 72 hours old, which is more than enough time to commit his wordplay to memory. The studio effort's lead single "Humble." is sure to ring off in Palm Springs along with whatever material -- both new and old -- K.Dot delivers.Â  FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS

Coachella 2017 is almost here, and as always, the cream-of-the-crop festival has tonsÂ of incredible music lined up for those who have tickets to either weekend. With so many notable names on the bill, it's hard for us at Billboard to not be thrilled about just about everyone who will be there.

In looking at the roster, though, there are a few names that stand out as artists we really can't wait to see, whether it's because they're legendary, they have new music to perform, or they're promising up-and-comers. Take a look at who we're most looking forward to seeing in Indio.

FRIDAY

Francis and the Lights

The alt-R&B-meets-pop group knows how to bring people together with their eclectic, synth-heavy jams. Sure, Kanye West, Chance the Rapper and Bon Iver are supporters, but frontman Francis Farewell Starlite & co.'s knack for piecing together diverse melodies make the crew a sight to see.

Broods

The sibling duo hailing from New Zealand has made waves with their electro-pop jams like "Free" and "Bridges," with Georgia NottÂ taking lead on vocals and her multi-instrumentalist brother Caleb providing the bumping background sounds.Â While they're not strangers to the festival scene, Coachella is perhaps the biggest stage they've taken yet -- so they likely won't be holding anything back.

Sampha

Sampha's mood music will bring the soul to Coachella's diverse lineup. The Drake- and BeyoncÃ©-approved crooner's recently released album Process is sure to bring the instant feels (especially with deep cuts like "(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano" and "Timmy's Prayer") when attendees need a break from the turn-up.

Radiohead

Considering the rock band's absence and the general demographic of Coachella, the fest will likely serve as the first Radiohead experience for thousands in attendance.Â Above all, though, aÂ festival setting is definitely the prime place to hear Thom Yorke and co. deliver their eerie rock tunes.Â And a festival in the California desert? Talk about a perfect situation.

SATURDAY

DJ SnakeÂ

By now, it's no secret that Coachella is the breeding ground for some insane surprises. And with the star-studded roster DJ Snake has racked up with his handful of hits -- Justin Bieber,Â AlunaGeorge, Lil Jon and Migos, to name a few -- there's definitely a chance for a guest appearance or two.Â Seeing a DJ at a festival is exciting enough, but if said DJ brings out one (or several) of his famous friends during their set, that'd make for one exciting time.

FutureÂ

Any follower of the trap baptist knows Future brings his Hive to church during his live performances. After accomplishing the historic feat of landing back-to-back consecutive No. 1 albums earlier this year with Future and HNDRXX, respectively, the Atlanta hitmaker has more than enough material to heat up the desert.

Gryffin

Unlike DJ Snake, Gryffin doesn't have an album's worth of his ownÂ materialÂ to play during his 50-minute set. Yet, the New York City-based DJ has delivered a number of dance-worthy singles that are sure to make any festivalgoerÂ bust a move, and he's done a masterful job at remixingÂ hits like Tove Lo's "Talking Body"Â and "Surprise Yourself" by Jack GarrattÂ -- both of whom will be at Coachella, so you never know what surprisesÂ GryffinÂ could have up his sleeve.

Banks & Steelz

For 'Chella-goers craving alternative rock mashed with hip-hop, Banks & Steelz -- the duo comprised of Interpol frontman Paul Banks and Wu-Tang Clan's RZA -- will deliver the best of both worlds. Their collaborative debut Anything But Words not only carries the standouts "Giant" and "Love and War," it also features contributions from Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Florence and the Machine's Florence Welch, which -- fingers crossed -- means a surprise-filled set.

SUNDAY

NAOÂ

Her 2016 offering For All We Know delivered finger-snappin' electronic R&B gems like the lead single "Bad Blood" and other highlights like "Get to Know Ya" and "Adore You." The British singer-songwriter's sweet vocals are sure to lure attendees into a body-roll party.

Hans Zimmer

It's not every day you see a famous composer at a music festival, and if there's one who would serve as a must-see, it's the guy behind classic film scores from the likes ofÂ The Lion King,Â The Dark Knight Rises and Gladiator.Â C'mon, whoÂ wouldn'tÂ want to seeÂ thisÂ performed live, by the original composer, right in front of their eyes?

Lorde

While she has gifted us with a couple of new tracks from her forthcoming album, as well as a live performance of both, Coachella marks Lorde's first concert since beginning her comeback. Whether that means those in attendance will get the chance to see the live debut of more new material, witnessing "GreenÂ Light" and "Liability" (and frankly, just Lorde's presence in general)Â in person is pretty frickin' exciting.

Kendrick Lamar

When the rap god touches the stage on Sunday night, his new album DAMN. will be about 72 hours old, which is more than enough time to commit his wordplay to memory. The studio effort's lead single "Humble." is sure to ring off in Palm Springs along with whatever material -- both new and old -- K.Dot delivers.Â
