A partner at Dan Loeb's Third Point has left, according to people familiar with the matter.

Keri Findley left last week and was one of four partners at the $15 billion hedge fund, the people said. Her departure means the firm now just has three partners.

Findley started at New York-based Third Point in 2009 as an analyst and worked her way up, covering structured credit. She was made partner a little over a year ago, one of the people said.

Findley was the only female partner at the firm, according to the firm's website, and was one of the few senior women in the hedge fund industry. Her profile on the Third Point site has been taken offline.

Third Point, one of the industry's most tracked funds, managed $14.9 billion as of midyear 2016, according to the Hedge Fund Intelligence Billion Dollar Club ranking.
