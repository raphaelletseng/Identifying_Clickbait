Priyanka Chopra is not just our Desi Girl now. PC is a full-throttle global brand in herself. Be it her American show Quantico or Baywatch, that is all set to hit the silver screen in May, PC's journey as an entertainer has just seen ups.

Priyanka Chopra took to her Linkedin account to express her displeasure on the same. In a hard-hitting post against the ban, she wrote,

"The images have been adding up over the weekend. A young boy at an airport desperately clinging to his mother with fear in his eyes after being detained for hours at Dulles International airport in Washington DC, unable to fathom the chaos of being stopped entry into what he knew as his home.

The US has always acknowledged that it is a country built by immigrants. The anger, frustration, and helplessness that followed US State Department‚Äôs 90-day ban of people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the US is justified.

As a global citizen, this has deeply affected me.

Getting ready to post this blog, I was grounded by the news. All of the ‚Äòbanned‚Äô countries are places where a lot of UNICEF work is going on, where children are suffering the most. What can I add that people across professions and age groups have not already said? But adding your voice will definitely make a difference.

And make a difference we must. Please join me in making our voice stronger so that globally, our children are not discriminated against on the basis of their religion and do not have to bear the brunt of a political witch hunt.‚Äù
