15 fascinating facts about North Korea


Everyone has heard a thing or two about North Korea.

The countryÂ frequently makes headlines, with recent notable examples such as its support ofÂ Donald Trump and itsÂ claims about planning to travel to the moon.

But some of its actions aren't quite so benign, including the recent firing of ballistic missiles into the sea.

The rest of the world has become increasingly responsive to the country's more threatening actions. In July, the US agreed to equip South Korea with its most advanced missile defense system. A month later, Japan ordered its military to be ready at any time to shoot down North Korean missiles.

No one seems to know what North Korea will do next or what's actually going on inside the country, as data isn't readily available or reliable. But there are some statistics and facts that lend perspective to theÂ Hermit Kingdom.
