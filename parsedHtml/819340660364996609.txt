Fetus Found in Clogged Drain Pipe of Brooklyn Home: NYPD By Wale Aliyu

A fetus was found in a drain at a home in Brooklyn after a resident called a plumber to report issues with the pipes, police and law enforcement sources say.

Authorities said a woman who was about three months pregnant went to the bathroom and discovered she had a miscarriage. She then flushed the toilet and clogged it, so she contacted maintenance workers in her building to fix it.

It was then that plumbers discovered the fetal remains in the pipes at the East 83rd Street home in Canarsie at around 2 p.m. Tuesday and called police.

Police have not filed any charges.

The age of the fetus wasn't clear. No information on the mother's health or whether she was taken to a hospital was immediately available.

The medical examiner is to determine the exact cause of death.
