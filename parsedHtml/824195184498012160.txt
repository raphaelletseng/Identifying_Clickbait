This year’s theme was "Manus x Machina: Fashion In An Age Of Technology,” and while other stars traipsed up the steps of the Met in sequins and shimmers (or, if you’re Beyonce, latex), the singer innovated and strapped a leather corset top over her black-speckled white maxi dress by Louis Vuitton, shiny black Louis Vuittons to boot--pun intended.  A pop of bright color from Ms. Selena came in the form of a traffic-cone orange Mugler jumpsuit at the iHeartRadio Music Awards in April 2016. A double-banded choker necklace and tousled waves of brown hair show Gomez’s personal casual style shines through. Selena’s looks so far have been a lot of things: Glamourous, fierce, but up until now we haven’t seen her in something truly . On a trip to paris in March 2016, the singer channeled Audrey Hepburn (the supreme chancellor of chic) in a MONSE off-the-shoulder two-piece, a riff on a deconstructed double-breasted suit. The pinstripes! The red lip! The tousled pony! Selena was on the metallic trend with a shiny silver Louis Vuitton gown at the 2016 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Beverly Hills. Her pin-straight hair’s subtle ombre parted down the middle paired with a smoky eye and a nude lip made sure the look wasn’t too harsh. The pop star looks more like a movie star with subtle curls and classic, shimmery Calvin Klein dress at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. A sparkly red halter dress with a leggy slit and deathly straight black hair made the actress look fierce as hell at the American Music Awards in November 2015. Selena said that she felt “like a princess” at the 'China: Through The Looking Glass' Costume Institute Benefit Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in May 2015. She arrived in a backless white Vera Wang number with black tassle detail and a flowering hair piece. In perhaps her most mature look up to this point, Selena dons a simple black silhouette with a middle part pulled back into a conservative updo.

Selena Gomez Style: Her Fashion Evolution

Selena Gomez has been on the scene for about a decade now, and boy, has she grown up! From her first days of Wizards of Waverly Place and wearing Converse sneakers on red carpets, all the way to the steps of the Met Gala and frolicking though the Italian streets in designer duds, Selena's style has evolved (she even has her own clothing line).
