The grim truth behind this photo reveals what it's really like to be a mother


Almost as popular as making our lives look perfect on social media is the growing trend to call out such bulls*it and show the truth behind the perfectly edited, lit and filtered pictures we post.

The latest brave woman to do this is Sophie Cachia, who posted a cute photo of her and her son on Instagram.

But she wrote in the caption that there was more to the story:

To the naked eye, this looks like your standard cute photo of Bobby & I. This photo was in fact captured whilst I was taking a poo. Just thought I'd let you all know. Especially for all those planning on having children soon. This. Is. Your. Life. Goodnight

So that's a no to ever having children, then.
