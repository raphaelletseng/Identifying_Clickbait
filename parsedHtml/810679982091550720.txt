MSNBC's Reid: Voice of America Broadcast Network Could Become 'Essentially Breitbart' - Breitbart
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER During Saturday’s MSNBC “AM Joy” broadcast, host Joy Reid discussed the change in broadcast network Voice of America that can now be controlled by a presidentially appointed director and broadcasted worldwide. FOR OUR NEWSLETTER According to Reid, Voice of America, which is broadcasted worldwide, could “become essentially Breitbart.” “Trump will inherit a state-run TV network with expanded outreach,” Reid stated. “The danger here is that the voice of the United States to the rest of the world, where we typically broadcast sometimes into authoritarian countries in trying to get them objective news, could instead become essentially Breitbart or become the voice of Donald Trump. How dangerous would that be to the United States’ ability to have influence in countries that are repressive?”
