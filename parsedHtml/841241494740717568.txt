Android malware: 38 new phones and tablets found to be pre-installed with virus before being sold
Over 30 different Android smartphones and tablets have been found to have had malware preinstalled on them before users even switched them on, according to a cyber security firm. Check Point detected a “severe infection” on 38 handsets being used by two of its corporate clients, a telecommunications firm and a multinational technology company that have not been named. The issue affects smartphones from a number of big-name brands, including Samsung, LG and Google. Those named by Check Point are: Samsung Galaxy Note 2 LG G4 Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S4 Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Xiaomi Mi 4i Galaxy A5 ZTE x500 Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 Oppo N3 Vivo X6 plus Nexus 5 Nexus 5X Asus Zenfone 2 Lenovo S90 Oppo R7 plus Xiaomi Redmi Lenovo A850 It must be made clear, however, that not all models of the devices named above are affected. “According to the findings, the malware were already present on the devices even before the users received them,” reads the Check Point blog post announcing the discovery.
