The 20 best tech jobs in America right now


Once again, tech jobs dominate Glassdoor'sÂ list of the 50 best jobs in America.

But, it turns out, you don't have to work in the tech industry to have one of the best tech jobs this year.

As Dr. Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor'sÂ chief economist, tells Business Insider, companies across all industries, including healthcare, finance, and retail, are hiring workers for these needed positions. "Any organization today with a mobile app, web presence, or digitized data are struggling to fill jobs like data scientists, software engineers, and mobile developers," Chamberlain says.

Glassdoor's 50 Best Jobs in America report identifies careersÂ with the highest overall "job score," whichÂ is determined by weighing three factors equally: earning potential (median annual base salary), job satisfaction rating, and number of job openings.Â

For a job title to be considered, it had toÂ receive at least 100Â salary reports and 100Â job satisfactionÂ ratings shared by US-based employees over the past year. The number of job openings per job title represents active job listings on Glassdoor as of January 1, 2017.Â

"This report reinforces that the best jobs are highly skilled and are staying ahead of the growing trend toward workplace automation," Chamberlain says.

He explains that the skills helping workers stay ahead of automation are creativity, judgment, and flexibility.

"Many of the jobs on this list require proficiency in these 'soft' skills," he explains. "In tech, that includes data science and engineering, which requires the ability to creatively solve problems to deliver business value."

Below areÂ the 14 tech roles among Glassdoor'sÂ 50 best jobs, as well as the six next best tech roles according to Glassdoor:
