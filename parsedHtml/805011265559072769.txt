BMW Unveils The Latest Rolling Sculpture ‘Art Car’, Will Race It On The Track In January 2017 BMW has a rich history of artists using the brand’s cars as a canvas for their art works. No wonder they are called ‘Art Cars’. It all began back in 1975 when racing driver Herve Poulain asked artist Alexander Calder to paint his BMW 3.0 CSL that he would later go on to race in the 24 Hours of LeMans. Since then, artists such as Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Ken Done and Ceaser Manrique have painted legendary cars like the 320i Turbo, M1, M3 and 730i, among others. And now there is another - BMW commissioned American artist John Baldessari to paint the racing spec M6 GTLM car. Here are the results. This is the nineteenth Art Car and you can see some Baldessari trademarks like the big red dot on the roof and the front bumper. Meanwhile, here are some other Art Cars BMW created before.
