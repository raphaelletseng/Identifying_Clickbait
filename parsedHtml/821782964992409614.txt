Project Star Gate: CIA makes details of its psychic control plans public
The CIA has revealed details of its "Project Star Gate" mission to develop psychic abilities for the first time. The revelations come as part of a huge dump of documents – almost 12 million in all – that are being made available on the internet. And they show the organisation's plans to harness the supernatural in ways that have never been seen before. Project Star Gate, as it was known, was the codename for a US government project intended to use psychic and supernatural phenomenon for spying and military uses. In one of the pages , it lays out why the government wants to use it – the benefits include the fact that it is "passive", "inexpensive" and that there is "no known defense".

The papers show how the organisation was looking to harness those powers to spy on people, to make changes to important objects and . All of that would be done by operatives far from the people and things that were actually being affected.
