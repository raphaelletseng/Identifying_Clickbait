Map shows funniest names to use when anyone leaves EU


Brexit caused something of a political earthquake and in its wake, Eurosceptic parties across the continent intensified demands for their own referendums.

Shortly after the result was announced last year, French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen called for a 'Frexit' vote while the far-Right Dutch firebrand Geert Wilders called for a 'Nexit'.

There were also fears that Brexit could also trigger a Czexit, a Swexit, and a Grexit in the Czech Republic, Sweden and Greece.

Now a new map has looked at a host of puns and portmanteaux for the other countries which could follow suit.

And Marine Le Pen has vowed to offer French voters a referendum to leave the EU and wants to leave the euro, known as Frexit.

Le Pen, who has promised to dump the euro and hold a Brexit-style referendum, has recently appeared to soften her stance, saying she is open to a 'common currency' alongside a national currency.

Last May, an Ipsos Mori poll revealed that more than half of French and Italian citizens want a referendum, and the same number believed there would be a 'domino effect' if Britain were to leave.
