In the Indian Ocean, Fragments of a Continent Where They Should Not Be
In the Indian Ocean, Fragments of a Continent Where They Should Not Be

Dear Africa, Asia, Antarctica, Australia, Europe, North America and South America:

No need to stress.

If you’ve heard anything about a newly discovered “lost continent” beneath the Indian Ocean, don’t worry too much: Your spots as the continental magnificent seven are secure.

It’s true that geologists have found something strange under the island of Mauritius, the former British colony east of Madagascar with a population of 1.3 million. They’re calling it “Mauritia.” But it’s not a continent like you all are. As Lewis D. Ashwal, the researcher who made the discovery, put it: “It’s a continent in the geological sense, not in the geographical one.”

Mauritia is not something people can see, visit or live on, because it's buried beneath millions of years’ worth of volcanic material.
