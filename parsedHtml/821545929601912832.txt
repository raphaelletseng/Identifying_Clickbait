Betty White and Other Celebs Crushing it Over 90


Happy Birthday, Betty White! The iconic actress turns 95 today, and she’s showing no signs of slowing down. Thank heavens! She’s still booking regular acting gigs and public appearances. She’s also very involved in her animal rights, which have been a lifelong passion for her. The adored actress has an extensive and distinguished career that has spanned 60 years and earned her a whopping five Primetime Emmys and 17 nominations. How is she going to celebrate? Word on the street (or an interview with Closer Weekly) has it she’s having a poker party with some of her closest girlfriends. Oh and a vodka and tonic. God bless you, Betty White!
