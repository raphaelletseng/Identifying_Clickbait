Titleist is the household name when it comes to golf balls, especially the company's hugely popular Pro-V1 line.

Kirkland is a household name too. One that makes up 20% of the products you'll find at your nearest Costco, from laundry detergent, pet food and toilet paper to canned foods, beer, automotive products and beauty aids. That's some serious range. The volume wholesaler is now in the $1.5 billion golf ball market too and its signature Kirkland ball has been flying off the shelves.

The price point was right from the start. The Kirkland Four-Piece Urethane Cover Golf Ball sells for $29.99 for two dozen, an average of about $1.25 per ball. By comparison, the best-selling ball in golf -- the Titleist Pro-V1 -- retails for $48 a dozen, almost $3 more per ball. What caught a lot of people by surprise, though, was the quality of the Costco balls, which are made in South Korea.

MyGolfSpy, which bills itself as the Consumer Reports for the golf equipment industry, recently conducted comprehensive testing that found the metrics of the Kirkland Signature Tour Performance ball equaled or surpassed the ProV1. With a driver, the inexpensive Kirkland flew almost 10 yards farther than the sport's most popular ball. MyGolfSpy gave the Kirkland a 10 out of 10 rating. Good luck keeping the balls in stock after that, even at a massive wholesale club like Costco.
