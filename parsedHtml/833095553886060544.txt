Larry Wilmore To Milo Yiannopoulos: 'Go F**k Yourself'
Larry Wilmore To Milo Yiannopoulos: 'Go F**k Yourself'
might have been willing to give ultra-right wing agitator Milo Yiannopoulos a free pass on “ Real Time ,” Friday night, but that certainly wasn’t happening on the post-program revisit “ Overtime .” Comedian Larry Wilmore told Yiannopoulos to “go fuck yourself” twice, once after the white nationalists’ favorite claimed that transgender people suffer from “a psychiatric disorder” and shouldn’t be “around little girls.” Yiannopoulos said they are “vastly disproportionately involved with sex crimes.” “I make no apologies for protecting women and children,” he added. Maher, astonishingly agreed, saying, “that’s not unreasonable.” The host asked panelist and former Republican congressman from Georgia Jack Kingston, “where do you stand on weirdos peeing?” After Wilmore and “Overtime” panelist counter-terrorism expert Malcolm Nance attacked Yiannopoulos, Maher asked him why he always had to fight with people. “We were having such a nice time, but you always invite such awful people on your show, they’re so stupid,” he whined to Maher. “You need to start inviting higher-IQ guests.” Wilmore responded that Nance could “talk circles around your pathetic, douchey little ass.” The men mostly smiled or chuckled through the parries and Kingston urged Yiannopoulos on, saying, “Milo, for it, Brother.” “Are you the real, true face of the alt-right?” Nance asked at one point. “I thought the Nazis were in there, how did they take you on board?” Yiannopoulos responded that they hate him. “The worst people on the very far left and the very far right all hate me,” he added. Wilmore quipped, “I think you’re leaving out a lot of people.” Maher advised Yiannopoulos to tone down his rhetoric — not just for the show but in general. “Look, this is the beginning of your career,” he said. “People are just starting to hate you. You remind me of a young, gay, alive Christopher Hitchens, but you gotta lose that kind of shit.” Twitter, meanwhile, wasn’t particularly happy about Maher’s gentle treatment of his guest earlier on “Real Time,” when the two seemed to get on famously and Maher never held Yiannopoulos’ feet to the fire. Others were simply outraged he was invited to begin with. How does Milo Yiannopoulos get off showing up on @billmaher to mock transgender woman while dressed/styled like Coco Chanel on a budget? Watching the Real Time clip confirms: @jeremyscahill made the right call. Milo Yiannopoulos is a self-admitted troll (& proud). I'm disappointed in @billmaher for comparing him to the great Chris Hitchens #RealTime @ColMorrisDavis  @RealTimers  @billmaher I saw who was on and turned it off. Garbage in garbage out.....no garbage for me. "You can go f**k yourself, alright?" – @larrywilmore keeping it 💯 to #MiloYiannopoulos on #RTOvertime .

Bill Maher might have been willing to give ultra-right wing agitator Milo Yiannopoulos a free pass on “Real Time,” Friday night, but that certainly wasn’t happening on the post-program revisit “Overtime.”

Comedian Larry Wilmore told Yiannopoulos to “go fuck yourself” twice, once after the white nationalists’ favorite claimed that transgender people suffer from “a psychiatric disorder” and shouldn’t be “around little girls.” Yiannopoulos said they are “vastly disproportionately involved with sex crimes.” “I make no apologies for protecting women and children,” he added. Maher, astonishingly agreed, saying, “that’s not unreasonable.” The host asked panelist and former Republican congressman from Georgia Jack Kingston, “where do you stand on weirdos peeing?”

After Wilmore and “Overtime” panelist counter-terrorism expert Malcolm Nance attacked Yiannopoulos, Maher asked him why he always had to fight with people. “We were having such a nice time, but you always invite such awful people on your show, they’re so stupid,” he whined to Maher. “You need to start inviting higher-IQ guests.”

Wilmore responded that Nance could “talk circles around your pathetic, douchey little ass.”

The men mostly smiled or chuckled through the parries and Kingston urged Yiannopoulos on, saying, “Milo, for it, Brother.”

“Are you the real, true face of the alt-right?” Nance asked at one point. “I thought the Nazis were in there, how did they take you on board?”

Yiannopoulos responded that they hate him. “The worst people on the very far left and the very far right all hate me,” he added.

Wilmore quipped, “I think you’re leaving out a lot of people.”

Maher advised Yiannopoulos to tone down his rhetoric — not just for the show but in general. “Look, this is the beginning of your career,” he said. “People are just starting to hate you. You remind me of a young, gay, alive Christopher Hitchens, but you gotta lose that kind of shit.”

Twitter, meanwhile, wasn’t particularly happy about Maher’s gentle treatment of his guest earlier on “Real Time,” when the two seemed to get on famously and Maher never held Yiannopoulos’ feet to the fire. Others were simply outraged he was invited to begin with.
