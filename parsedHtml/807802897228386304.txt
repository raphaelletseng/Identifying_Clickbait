Venezuela seizes 4m toys from Kreisel to give poor children at Christmas

Updated

Poor children in Venezuela will this Christmas be given nearly 4 million toys seized from a toy company accused of illegally jacking up prices, the Government says.

The country's fair pricing authority took the toys from three warehouses run by Kreisel, Venezuela's largest toy distributor, on Friday.

Two company executives have been detained on suspicion of promoting price speculation.

Agency director William Contreras alleged that Kreisel underreported its inventory in order to sell some toys at higher prices.

Kreisel has not directly responded to the action taken by the embattled socialist government, but has replied and retweeted messages of support online.

Mr Contreras said the seizure would teach companies "that you can't play with the rights of Venezuelans".

Authorities said local supply committees will be in charge of distributing the toys "fairly" to children.

Venezuela has been wracked by a deep economic crisis accompanied by shortages of goods ranging from food staples to medicine.

In recent days President Nicolas Maduro ordered stores to lower their prices between 30 and 50 per cent.
