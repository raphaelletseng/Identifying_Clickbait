This cat hanging with his boys took the best selfie of all time
This cat hanging with his boys took the best selfie of all time
It's a depressing thing, to see a picture and instantly know you aren't cool enough to hang with a cat and some dogs. A selfie taken by Manny, the selfie-loving cat, is already being called the best of 2017. I try to avoid hyperbole so know that I mean to be taken literally when I say that this in fact, the best selfie of the year. SEE ALSO: This photogenic cat has conquered the selfie game I mean, look at this cat and his boys. Manny and his bros are going cruising tonight and they dropped a dope selfie on social to let everyone know where the party's at (wherever they are). A photo posted by Manny The Selfie Cat (@yoremahm) on Manny's owner told last year that the selfies are taken when Manny reaches for a GoPro. Why a GoPro? They're small enough to comfortably fit in the hot jeans Manny is wearing to the bar tonight. Damn, Manny. Hit me up if you ever wanna hang.

Manny's owner told Mashable last year that the selfies are taken when Manny reaches for a GoPro.

Why a GoPro? They're small enough to comfortably fit in the hot jeans Manny is wearing to the bar tonight.

Damn, Manny. Hit me up if you ever wanna hang.
