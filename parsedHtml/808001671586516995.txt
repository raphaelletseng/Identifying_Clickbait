Lang (2:40 p.m.): The Packers guard, who broke his foot on Nov. 13, is back on the active roster for the first time since that injury. However, it's unclear how much game action he'll get. Joe Staley (2:40 p.m.): San Francisco's left tackle will miss Sunday's game with a hamstring injury, ending a streak of 92 consecutive starts. Expect the Jets' pass rush to have a little extra spring in its step against the 49ers as a result. Julio Jones (2:15 p.m.): Apparently, the pregame workout did not go well enough for the wide receiver for the Falcons to be willing to let him play. Taylor Gabriel and Aldrick Robinson get fantasy boosts as a result. Trevor Siemian (11:59 a.m.): The Broncos quarterback will indeed be active , but his left foot will be heavily taped and braced. That could cut into his already limited mobility and could elevate the fantasy value of the Titans' D/ST. Philadelphia Eagles (11:53 a.m.): Expect offensive line troubles for the Eagles, as RG Brandon Brooks  will miss his second game in three weeks because of illness. Isaac Seumalo is expected to start for only the second time in his career. Pittsburgh Steelers (11:50 a.m.): Both Chris Boswell (abdominal injury) and Randy Bullock are active for this week's game. With two kickers to turn to and a head coach who has no problem going for two on each and every conversion attempt, fantasy owners should go nowhere near either player today. DeAndre Levy (11:45 a.m.): The Lions will have their linebacker back in action for the first time since Week 1, when multiple injuries forced Levy to the sideline. Levy has played only twice the past two seasons. Chris Ivory (7:50 a.m.): According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Ivory will not play today for the Jaguars because of his lingering hamstring injury. Jacksonville's promotion of RB Bronson Hill to the 53-man roster was also a good indicator of Ivory's status. T.J. Yeldon might see a boost in fantasy value as a result. Detroit Lions (7:45 a.m.): Although it's still possible that both players will suffer some sort of setback in warm-ups, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports that the duo of TE Eric Ebron ( knee ) and WR Marvin Jones ( thigh ) will be able to play for the Lions. Julio Jones (7:40 a.m.): It will be a game-time call for the elite Falcons wideout, and with the late start, Jones might not be worth the risk. Although coach Dan Quinn intimated that he expected Jones to play after the receiver participated in Friday's walk-through, a final call won't come until the team sees Jones test his injured toe on the field. Philadelphia Eagles (7:35 a.m.): Seen limping during the week and dealing with an abdominal injury, Dorial Green-Beckham is looking like he might sit out Sunday's game for the Eagles. However, ESPN's Adam Schefter notes that WR Jordan Matthews (ankle) will be able to play. Mark Ingram (7:30 a.m.): After missing practice Thursday, Ingram participated in New Orleans' Friday session -- a good sign that his injuries are moving in the right direction. Tim Hightower should still get enough touches to be fantasy-relevant on Sunday, but it is looking like Ingram will suit up as well. Jordan Reed (7:25 a.m.): The Washington tight end, who appeared to still be dealing with some discomfort from his separated left shoulder during practice this week, is nonetheless expected to play against the Eagles today.
