Monkey tries to get hold of banana stuck behind a car windscreen Â 


Monkeys may be known for their love of bananas, but this one seemed particularly desperate to get hold of the fruit - despite it being stuck behind a car windscreen.

A hilarious video shows the monkey repeatedly trying to get the banana that is sitting inside the car.

The determined monkey is seen opening its mouth to try to eat the fruit, before trying with its hands.

The person filming inside the car can be heard laughing and saying 'He doesn't give up' as he watches bemusedly.

It then appears to gesture to two other monkeys what the problem is by tapping on the windscreen, before stepping aside to let them have a go.

The pair can then be seen examining the banana, but appear to be flummoxed by why they cannot get it.

The video is believed to have been filmed in India, but the exact location is not known.

Although monkeys clearly enjoy eating bananas, the type cultivated for human consumption is much higher in sugar than most wild fruit.

Some monkeys living in the wild never come across bananas at all - instead eating other fruit, leaves and insects.
