MPs vote to give May power to trigger article 50 – as it happened

Summary The bill still has to get through another three days of debate in the Commons, and then it will go to the Lords, but with MPs backing it by such a large margin it now seems certain to clear all its parliamentary stages by the beginning of March. This means Theresa May will be able to trigger article 50 as she plans before the end of that month, starting a two-year process that should lead to the UK being out of the EU before April 2019. (See 8.38pm.) Corbyn has said he understands why MPs representing remain areas found it hard to follow the Labour whip and vote for the bill and party sources are playing down the prospect of mass sackings. But the decision to back the Tories over Brexit has gone down very badly with the party’s activist base, and it is possible that the vote could traumatise the party for years to come, just as the vote for the Iraq war vote did in 2003. Here are highlights from the debate. That’s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Updated       A Conservative party spokesman said this about the vote. Forty seven Labour MPs voting against the article 50 Bill shows Labour can’t speak for themselves, let alone speak for the country. They’re hopelessly divided and can’t even agree whether they should back the Bill to implement the decision taken by the public to leave the EU. What we do know is that they aren’t interested in controlling our own laws or immigration and are completely out of touch with ordinary working people.      We’ve found another shadow minister who voted against the bill (Lyn Brown, policing), and so I have updated the post below about the scale of the Labour rebellion and adjusted the figures. (See 8.38pm.) We now have 17 Labour frontbenchers (shadow ministers and whips) either resigned over the vote or defied the whip.      The Lib Dem leader put out this statement after the result. The Tories and Labour have failed future generations today by supporting a hard Brexit. Labour’s leadership tonight have waved the white flag. They are not an opposition, they are cheerleaders. The Liberal Democrats will continue to fight to give the British people the final say on the deal.      The Labour party will not be taking any disciplinary action tonight against the frontbenchers who defied the whip and voted against the article 50 bill (see 8.38pm) , ITV’s reports. I'm told NO disciplinary action against Labour rebels tonight. Perhaps not for several days until #Article50 Bill has progressed further      has put out this statement about the vote. A spokesman for the Labour leader said: Labour MPs voted more than three to one in favour of triggering article 50. Now the battle of the week ahead is to shape Brexit negotiations to put jobs, living standards and accountability centre stage. Labour’s amendments are the real agenda. The challenge is for MPs of all parties to ensure the best deal for Britain, and that doesn’t mean giving Theresa May a free hand to turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven.      Full details of the Labour rebellion Here are the key figures that show the size of the Labour rebellion tonight. That’s 20% of the parliamentary party. They are: Jo Stevens, the shadow Welsh secretary, Rachael Maskell, the shadow environment secretary, and Dawn Butler, shadow minister for BME communities. They are the three shadow cabinet ministers and Tulip Siddiq, who was shadow early years minister. The nine shadow ministers are: Kevin Brennan (culture), Ruth Cadbury (housing), Alan Whitehead (energy), Rupa Huq (crime prevention), Stephen Pound (Northern Ireland), Andy Slaughter (housing), Catherine West (Foreign Office), Daneil Zeichner (transport), Rosena Allin-Khan (culture) and Lyn Brown (policing). They are Thangam Debonnaire, Vicky Foxcroft and Jeff Smith. I’ve updated the paragraph about shadow ministers defying the whip to say there were 10, not nine. The Press Association points out that Lyn Brown, a shadow police minister, voted against the bill. Updated       The list I posted earlier, naming all 114 MPs who voted against the article 50 bill getting a second reading, has now been updated so that they are sorted by party. (See 8.03pm.) You may need to refresh the page to get the update to appear.      This is from the Twitter feed, an official party account. CORRECTION: Labour MPs voted more than 3 to 1 in favour of triggering Article 50 . 167 to 47.      , the shadow home secretary, did not vote tonight. She was one of the members of the shadow cabinet who was known to be particularly unhappy about the prospect of voting for article 50 but, according to Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh, her office say she was stayed away because she was ill. . @HackneyAbbott office tell me she didn't vote because she was ill. Went home at 5pm.      the foreign secretary, has tweeted this about the result. Historic vote in Parliament tonight. A huge majority to get our Brexit negotiations going forward.
