16 signs you've 'made it' in America


The American Dream has transformed over time.

To find out what it means to Americans today, personal-budgeting company You Need A Budget and market-research company OnePoll surveyed the financial aspirations of 2,000 Americans.

The result is a list of 30-plus signs that indicate achievement of the modern American Dream, ranging from paying for a Netflix account to shopping at Whole Foods to owning a second home.

Below, find 16 signs from the survey that you've "made it." And remember: Just like the Dream has evolved over time, it also varies√Ç from person to person. Whether or not you've truly "made it" isn't about your car or travel schedule. It's completely up to you.
