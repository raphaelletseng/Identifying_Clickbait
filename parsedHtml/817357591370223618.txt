No Freebies? No Problem! 85% Of Jio Users Will Retain Service Even After Offers Dry Up!
No Freebies? No Problem! 85 Per Cent Of Jio Users Will Retain Service Even After Offers End! About 85% of customers using will continue to use it even after the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco starts charging for data services from April 1, though most of them would use it as a secondary connection, a survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch has shown. About 67% said they would use Jio as a secondary SIM, while 18% said it would be their primary connection. Also, about 57% of those willing to stick with Jio said that they will go for its Rs 400-500 package rather than the cheapest one, the survey said. The survey showed that Bharti Airtel had the most satisfied customers, at 97.7%, against 89% for smaller telcos. At 17%, Bharti Airtel customers were the least interested in Jio as a primary SIM if the quality was good, while it was 41% for smaller telcos. Smaller telcos like Reliance Communications are the most vulnerable as most of their connections are secondary for their customers, who may shift to Jio, BoFA-ML said. About 24% of the respondents said they have not tested Jio. The biggest barrier (around 40%) for them appeared to be handset incompatibility or the need to upgrade their phones, while long queues were the second-most widely cited reason (31%). About 27% of them said they were satisfied with the current operator. The survey said that Jio’s free service was gaining reasonable traction with 26% respondents using Jio as primary SIM and 21% as secondary SIM. BofAML commissioned Survey Monkey to conduct an online survey of 1,000+ respondents across the country with 500+ Jio users. The sample had a 47%/53% female/male mix, with 38% in the 18-29 years age bracket, 40% aged 30-44 years, 14% aged 45-59 years and 7% in the 60+ year's age group. The brokerage’s September survey demonstrated a high willingness among consumers to try out the Jio SIM. In the latest survey, too, over 75% were either using Jio or have tested it on someone else’s connection – up from 39% in September. “Interestingly, 26% users use Jio as primary SIM, which we think is more a reflection of constraints of the current handsets that have 4G only in the primary SIM slot. Over 5% consumers have used Jio dongles,” the survey found. ALSO READ:
