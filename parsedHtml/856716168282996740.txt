The Invitation

This 2016 thriller from Karyn Kusama (“Girlfight”) burns a long fuse in detailing the strange and increasingly ominous events at a Hollywood Hills dinner party. In fact, many of the guests are surprised to have been invited at all, not least the host’s ex-husband (Logan Marshall-Green), who hasn’t seen her since she remarried and split town for two years on a spiritual quest. As the evening unfolds, details about her trip begin to emerge and the party games get personal and nasty, but the guests have trouble leaving, if only because it violates social protocol. When Kusama finally lets loose, “The Invitation” explodes into chaos, but it’s grounded in an exploration of shared grief and the ugly ways in which it can manifest.
