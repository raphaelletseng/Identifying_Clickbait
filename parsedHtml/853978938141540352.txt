It's always reassuring when the creator of one of television's most popular, unpredictable dramas voices concerns about the U.S. president, isn't it?

Damon Lindelof, co-creator of Lost and HBO's The Leftovers â€” a show that focuses on a mysterious disappearance of two percent of the global population â€” recently shared some uh, terrifying thoughts on the 2016 presidential election and Donald Trump's victory while at Parisâ€™ Series Mania TV festival.

Speaking at a masterclass at the festival, Variety reported that Lindelof got into politics a bit, drawing a connecting between the apocalypse and the results of the 2016 election.

"With all apocalyptic thinking, if itâ€™s not happening fast enough we are going to bring it about, which I think explains the election in America," Lindelof said. "If you are unhappy with the way things are going, you may want to elect an agent of destruction," he went on, referring to the now-president of the United States.Â

When asked if the 2016 presidential election changed his perception of the third and final season of The Leftovers, Lindelof reminisced on the confidence surrounding Hillary Clinton's potential victory and the feeling that those results would take the world "a step away from the apocalypse."

"We wrote the show between January and August of 2016. While there was spirited political conversation at all times," he explained, according to Inverse. "But that idea in The Leftovers is that the Sudden Departure forced everyone to reevaluate the world they lived in and suddenly understand that things were not as stable as they seemed. They were surprised, and unpleasantly so."
