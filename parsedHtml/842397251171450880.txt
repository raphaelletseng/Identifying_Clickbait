Trump just nominated a top Boeing executive to be Mattisâ second-in-command


US President Donald Trump just nominated Boeing Vice PresidentÂ Patrick Shanahan to serve as Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis' second-in-command, Defense News' Aaron Mehta reports.

Originally, Mattis had approachedÂ MichÃ¨le Flournoy, a cofounder of the Center for a New American Security, to serve as his deputy, but she declined for moral reasons.Â

At Boeing, the second largest US defense contractor, Shanahan oversees supply chain issues and manages manufacturing operations as well as leading health and safety initiatives, according to Boeing's website.Â

Shanahan would replace Obama-appointee Robert Work in the role, which overseesÂ defense policy, acquisition, and budget teams.

The Trump administration has yet to nominate more than 500 positions requiring Senate approval in the executive branch.Â
