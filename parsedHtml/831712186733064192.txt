Celebrities And Activists Share Letters #ToImmigrantsWithLove On Twitter
Dozens of people on Twitter are writing digital and handwritten love letters for Valentine‚Äôs Day, and they‚Äôre signing them with #ToImmigrantsWithLove. The letter writing campaign was first launched in December by Define American, a non-profit pro-immigrant organization, and Welcome.us‚Äô I Am An Immigrant movement. On Tuesday, the campaign revived their hashtag for what they‚Äôre calling a Day of Action. The organizations asked supporters to show solidarity with immigrants by recording a video on their website or by writing letters and sharing them on social media using the hashtag #ToImmigrantsWithLove. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never been a more important time in modern U.S. history to stand in solidarity with immigrants across our country,‚Äù undocumented activist Jose Antonio Vargas, founder and CEO of Define American, said in a press release. ‚ÄúThis campaign comes at a crucial time not only for millions of immigrants who call America home but for the millions of American citizens and permanent residents whose lives are connected to ours. We are an immigrant nation and we love our immigrants. Let‚Äôs show it.‚Äù Immigrants have become increasingly vulnerable under the Trump administration with undocumented immigrants being targeted by a recent uptick of Immigration And Customs Enforcement raids across the country. In January, the president also attempted to limit the number of travelers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries with an executive order , which has since been temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Politicians, celebrities, activists and more shared their messages of love for immigrants on Tuesday, including Russell Simmons, Constance Wu, Debra Messing, George Takei, singer Estelle, U.S. Representative Judy Chu and U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin.
