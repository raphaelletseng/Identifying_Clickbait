Red faces at Fed Cup as Nazi-era anthem played before US-Germany match

Updated

The United States Tennis Association has apologised after an outdated version of the German national anthem that later became associated with the Nazi regime was performed before a Fed Cup match in Hawaii.

The anthem was sung before a Fed Cup quarterfinal between the United States and Germany.

It contained a verse that translates to "Germany, Germany, above all, above all in the world", which became identified with Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.

Andrea Petkovic, who was born in Bosnia, said after her match that she considered walking off the court as the anthem was sung.

"I thought it was the epitome of ignorance, and I've never felt more disrespected in my whole life, let alone in Fed Cup," she said.

"I've played Fed Cup for 13 years now and it is the worst thing that has ever happened to me."

The USTA issued a statement apologising for the mistake, saying: "In no way did we mean any disrespect. This mistake will not occur again, and the correct anthem will be performed for the remainder of this first-round tie."

"The USTA extends its sincerest apologies to the German Fed Cup team and all of its fans for the performance of an outdated national anthem prior to today's Fed Cup competition."

Petkovic's opponent in the match was Alison Riske, who was also apologetic.

"As it was happening, obviously, we have no idea," Riske said.

"But news got around to us and it's extremely unfortunate. We have nothing but respect for the German team and obviously that will not happen again."
