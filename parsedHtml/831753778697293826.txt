OPEC and its allies promised oil output cuts. Here’s the reality


For more than two years, a worldwide oil glut has depressed prices, bedeviled producers and roiled the economies of some nations dependent on crude sales. On Nov. 30, OPEC sought to stop the volatility by agreeing to trim output by a collective 1.2 million barrels a day for at least the first half of the year. Eleven non-OPEC nations led by Russia and Mexico pledged to cut production by an additional 558,000 barrels a day. January output numbers provide a first look at how far the two groups have to go to reach their goal.

In January, OPEC achieved a record compliance of at least 90 percent with its planned output cuts, estimates from the producer group and the Paris-based International Energy Agency show. Three of the group’s members met or exceeded their goal and others came close. Preliminary IEA figures for the non-OPEC producers curbing production show that they’ve implemented about half of their pledged cuts. OPEC is actively trimming production, while many non-OPEC producers are largely letting their supplies decline naturally.

Not all producers are alike in terms of politics, economics and geography. Among OPEC nations, Libya, Nigeria and Iran are allowed to boost output. Russia, the largest of the non-OPEC countries, is implementing cuts gradually. The market has already rebalanced in terms of supply and demand, according to Bjornar Tonhaugen, vice president for oil markets at consultancy Rystad Energy. “This is just speeding things up, drawing down the excess,” he says.

The 10 OPEC producers that agreed to cut output for the first half of the year used production figures from October as their starting point. Most of the non-OPEC nations are doing the same, though Kazakhstan is using November as its baseline. Still, the range of compliance varies widely. Through January, Angola, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are the only nations to meet their pledged output targets of the 21 nations that agreed to curb production.

Key to keeping the markets steady will be whether the other nations catch up. While the OPEC members have agreed to curb output for the only the first half of the year, an extension may be needed to rebalance the markets, according to oil ministers from Iran and Qatar.

Oil markets in recent months have been steadied by the promise alone of output cuts by some OPEC and non-OPEC producers. But as the reductions take effect, prices will rise, luring more producers such as those in the U.S.’ shale regions and tempting OPEC’s own members to cheat. That extra supply could trigger a glut all over again.
