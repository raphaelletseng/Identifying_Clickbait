Student Charged With Hazing in Peanut Butter Allergy Case
A 20-year-old college student in Michigan has been charged with hazing, accused of smearing peanut butter on the face of a friend who had a serious peanut allergy, the student’s lawyer said on Wednesday.

He woke up with peanut butter on his face and a severe reaction that his mother said could have been deadly. Mr. Leach said no one at the party knew that Mr. Seely had a peanut allergy.

The episode came to light in March, when the police in Mount Pleasant, a city of about 26,000 people two and half hours northwest of Detroit, said they were investigating the encounter involving self-identified members of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity. Mr. Seely’s mother, Teresa Seely, contacted the police after her son told his family what happened, and she posted a photograph of his distorted face on Facebook. “He could have been killed,” she wrote, adding that he carried medicine to counteract accidental exposure to peanuts.
