A lavish Caribbean estate with a private beach and coconut groveÂ has come onto the market for $67 million.Â

Originally built by banker and businessman Benjamin de Rothschild, the so-called "Girasol" is set on more than seven acres of land on the Caribbean island ofÂ Saint BarthÃ©lemy, or St. Barts.

Its current owner is former hedge fund manager Bruce Kovner, who bought the estate in 2005 and gave it a major makeover, adding in a new pool and deck. The property includes two villas that have a total of six bedrooms and two pools.

Christian Wattiau of Sibarth Real Estate has the listing, while Christie's International Real Estate is providing global marketing services.
