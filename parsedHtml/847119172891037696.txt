"I SHOULD BE UP THERE!"

The problem with performing stunts during any show is the ever looming possibility that something could go horribly wrong. James Corden and Kristen Bell learned that lesson the hard way Tuesday night on The Late Late Show with James Corden.

The pair started their performance of Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes's "Up Where We Belong" on solid footing but things went a bit haywire when their aerial lifts never quite matched up with one another. At one point, Corden tried to keep the romance of the song going by grabbing Bell's foot but, unfortunately, she kept drifting just out of his reach every time.

Maybe next time Corden's crew will be better at lifting them up to where they belong.
