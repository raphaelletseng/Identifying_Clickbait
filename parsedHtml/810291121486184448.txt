The Rikers Island bus: A journey like no other - BBC News


Many families will be making trips to visit loved ones this holiday season, but the lone public bus to New York's Rikers Island is a journey like no other.

The Q-100 travels through the borough of Queens to the infamous jail complex, and the riders are often visiting family members who are incarcerated there.

Photographer Salvador Espinoza has been recording their journeys - and their stories - and he spoke to the BBC.
