Net migration to Britain FALLS to 273,000
Net migration FALLS to 273,000 in first figures after Brexit vote


The number of people arriving in the UK from Bulgaria and Romania has risen significantly since the Brexit vote, new figures show.

But figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also reveal a 'statistically significant' rise in citizens from so-called EU8 nations - Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - leaving the UK.

The outflow of EU8 nationals was up 12,000 year-on-year to 39,000 - the highest for five years.

Immigration from the countries was 58,000, the lowest since they joined the European Union in 2004.

The net inflow to the UK was 273,000 in the year to September - down from 333,000 in the 12 months to the end of June

This was offset by a 'statistically significant' increase in immigration of Bulgarians and Romanians, which reached 74,000 - the highest on record.

The figures reveal net migration has fallen below 300,000 for the first time in two years in the aftermath of the historic Brexit vote.

The net inflow to the UK was 273,000 in the year to September - down from 333,000 in the 12 months to the end of June.

The number of arrivals was down to 596,000 while emigration was up to 323,000.

Theresa May has pledged that she will introduce controls on free movement rules following the Brexit vote

The findings came in data on international migration released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

It is the first estimate of the measure - the difference between the number of people leaving and arriving in the country - covering an extended period after the EU referendum.

The previous set of statistics showed net migration was running at a near record level of 335,000 in the year to the end of June.

That was well above the Government's target of under 100,000.

The previous figures also showed the inflow of EU citizens had hit a historic high of 284,000.

The latest details, which cover individuals coming to the country for more than 12 months, show that immigration was estimated to be 596,000 in the year to September, down 23,000 from the period to September 2015.

Some 268,000 of those were EU citizens, 257,000 came from outside the bloc, and 71,000 were Britons.

Nigel Farage said his prediction that at least 350,000 people would migrate to the UK from the EU2 nations had been vindicated

Emigration from the UK was up 26,000 to 323,000, including 103,000 EU citizens, 93,000 non-EU and 128,000 British citizens.

The number of Romanian and Bulgarian nationals was up 19,000 to 74,000 â€“ the highest on record.

Some 180,000 EU citizens arrived for work-related reasons, with approximately 63 per cent of those having a definite job to go to.

RECORD NUMBER OF ROMANIANS AND BULGARIANS ARRIVE The number of Bulgarians and Romanians migrating to the UK hit a record of 74,000 in the year to September. The 'statistically significant' increase means the so-called 'EU2' nations now account for 28 per cent of immigration from the bloc. The rise was partially offset by a fall in the number of nationals from eight other Eastern European states coming in. The EU8 countries - the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - joined the Brussels club in 2004. The outflow of nationals from these states was up by 12,000 year on year to 39,000 - the highest level for five years.

Overall the net flow from the union was 165,000 - the lowest for two years.

Inflows of people coming to study decreased by 41,000 in the year to September 2016.

The majority of the drop was made up of non-EU students, down 31,000.

The number of visas issued over the same period to non-EU students for 12 months or more was 141,286, up 2 per cent.

Separate figures released by the Home Office show that the number of European migrants and family members granted certificates confirming their right to live in the UK permanently more than tripled last year.

A total of 65,195 documents and cards certifying permanent residence were granted to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) and relatives in 2016.

That compared to 18,064 in the previous 12 months.

The status of EU citizens living in the UK has come under the spotlight following the referendum last year, and experts have warned the Government faces a huge administrative task if it attempts to register more than three million people from the bloc.

EU citizens who have lived continuously in the UK for at least five years automatically have a permanent right to live in Britain.

People from countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) - EU states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - plus Swiss nationals can apply for a document which confirms their right of permanent residence in the UK.

Non-European family members of EEA citizens can apply for a permanent residence card.

The latest figures show that 32,481 cards and documents were issued in the last three months of last year - a seven-fold jump compared to the equivalent period in 2015.

Downing Street welcomed the reduction but said there was no room for 'complacency'.

A spokesman for the PM said: 'Clearly we have seen a fall in net migration, which obviously we welcome, but we are not complacent about this.

'We are very clear there is more work to be done to bring net migration down to the target of tens of thousands.'

Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the figures vindicated his prediction that more than 350,000 people would migrate to the UK from Romania and Bulgaria.

'I apologise for what I said about Romanian and Bulgarian immigration in 2014. The figure is actually much higher,' he tweeted.

Nicola White, ONS Head of International Migration Statistics, said:

'This is the first release to contain long-term international migration estimates including three months of data following the EU referendum.

'Although we have seen a fall in net migration of EU8 citizens there have been continued increases in immigration from Romania and Bulgaria, so it is too early to say what effect the referendum result has had on long-term international migration.

'There has been a statistically significant decrease in non-EU long-term students immigrating to the UK while a small increase was seen in the number of study visas issued.

'It is too early to tell if this is an indication of a long-term trend.'

Alp Mehmet, Vice-Chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the fall in net migration was a 'step in the right direction'.

'There is still a net inflow from Eastern Europe, especially from Romania and Bulgaria,' he said.

'These workers are generally in low-paid employment so this is where our proposal for work permits confined to those coming for skilled work would have a very useful effect on EU migration.'

Immigration has been at the heart of fierce debate in both the run-up to and aftermath of the historic referendum in June.

Theresa May has pledged that she will introduce controls on free movement rules following the Brexit vote.

However, the shape of the new system will be the subject of tough negotiations with the EU.
