Tiger escapes circus, roams streets of Palermo in Italy

Updated

A tiger escaped from a circus in a small Italian town, roaming the streets for several hours before being recaptured.

The white Bengal tiger, named Oscar, is believed to have escaped from a Swedish circus that was visiting the town on the outskirts of Palermo in Sicily.

Monreale Mayor Piero Capizzi said at first he thought someone was joking when he was told a tiger was on the loose on Saturday.

But local traffic police indeed found the tiger on the run.

The animal was recaptured after being coaxed to go inside a series of increasingly smaller cages.

It was taken back to the circus.

The mayor says it is not known how the tiger escaped from the circus, which is currently performing in the Monreale area.
