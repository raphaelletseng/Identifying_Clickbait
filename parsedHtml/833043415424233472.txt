According to the Nielsen Music Year-End Report U.S. 2016 , 13.1 million vinyl albums were sold in 2016 (up from 11.88 million in 2015), representing 6.5% of total album sales. This is an all-time high in the Nielsen Music era.  38.9 million physical albums (CDs, cassettes, vinyl LPs) were sold online, via mail-order or at concert venues. So who buys vinyl these days? What kind of music do they listen to? With a big assist from the fine folks at eBay, I've put together a list of each U.S. state's favorite vinyl albums in 2016. Here's the methodology: "Favorite" means the album a state buys at the highest rate compared to that state's total share of the volume of records purchased. So let's say California is responsible for 20% of all record sales nationally. Let's also say that California is responsible for 40% of Nirvana's sales. If that 20% difference is the largest in for the state, then is California's favorite album. We used this method (as opposed to just top-selling albums) in an attempt to create a more diverse snapshot of the country and highlight states' unique tastes. To rule out outliers, the data is limited to the top 100 selling albums. For example, let's say an album only sold 10 copies, and eight of them were in California. Though California purchased 80% of the albums, it's only 10 albums. The top 100 limit gives us a floor for the data set. Got it? Cool. Let's start with a point of reference...

So who buys vinyl these days? What kind of music do they listen to?

With a big assist from the fine folks at eBay, I've put together a list of each U.S. state's favorite vinyl albums in 2016.

Here's the methodology:

"Favorite" means the album a state buys at the highest rate compared to that state's total share of the volume of records purchased.

So let's say California is responsible for 20% of all record sales nationally. Let's also say that California is responsible for 40% of Nirvana's Nevermind sales. If that 20% difference is the largest in for the state, then Nevermind is California's favorite album.

We used this method (as opposed to just top-selling albums) in an attempt to create a more diverse snapshot of the country and highlight states' unique tastes.

To rule out outliers, the data is limited to the top 100 selling albums. For example, let's say an album only sold 10 copies, and eight of them were in California. Though California purchased 80% of the albums, it's only 10 albums.

The top 100 limit gives us a floor for the data set.
