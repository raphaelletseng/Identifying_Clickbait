Dandelion doesn’t have a lot to feel so dandy about. Crayola announced Friday morning that the color would be retired from its boxes of 24 crayons and moved to greener pastures. Our beloved Dandelion decided to announce his retirement early!

More details will be released in the next few months. However, Boulden did reveal that the new crayon will be in the blue family, and its name will be voted on by fans “because we want you all to be part of Crayola history.” Many on social media immediately offered up their suggestions: #NewCrayonColors Crayony McColorface Or blue BlueyMcCrayonface — KSIMP88 (@KSIMP88) March 31, 2017 Red hot chili peppers #NewCrayonColors — BrittanyDuke (@XBrittanyDukeX) March 31, 2017 #NewCrayonColors Something Blue I'm serious.

In 1990, eight colors — including maize, lemon yellow, blue gray, raw umber, green blue, orange red, orange yellow, and violet blue — were replaced. And in 2003, more colors were given the boot, but customers were actually given the opportunity to save one — and burnt sienna was the lucky winner.
