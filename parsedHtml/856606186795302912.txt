This dude gave out free pizza to marathon runners because not all heroes wear capes
Search the sidelines of most marathons and you'll find kind spectators offering a bit of sustenance to the racers.Â But while most people offer runners water, gatorade, and maybe even a beer towards the finish line, at the London Marathon this weekend, one dude offered something much better: a slice of pepperoni pizza. Because he is a damn hero. While a bunch of runners passed by the offer, one very excited dude gladly accepted and continued running like a champ. Hey, sometimes you just need a slice of pizza. Now can we please applaud this sideline hero for being the real MVP. Here's what happens when you stick a Galaxy S8 in a Unicorn Frappuccino and drop it from 100 feet Desperate dog isn't ready to give up being the baby of the house Two fighting gators remind us that nature is scary as hell Someone stuffed a pizza inside a burger inside a pizza, because dreams do come true
