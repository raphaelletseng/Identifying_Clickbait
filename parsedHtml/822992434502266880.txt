Local Market Monitor   Orlando boasts 7.2% three-year population growth and 4.4% annual job growth, both list highs. “A growing economy makes up for a lot of other stuff," says Local Market Monitor CEO Ingo Winzer. "With a falling economy it doesn’t matter if things are good right now, they are not going to be good in a few years.”  Prices in Seattle rose 12% last year the most of any list city. The average home price is second highest. Says Winzer: "In the very top markets, both population and jobs are growing at high rates and builders aren't able to keep up, which is why home prices have increased rapidly and rental demand will be strong."    Salt Lake City  Home prices grew 9% in Tampa last year. Job growth was 2.6%. The population in the fourth and final Florida city on the list grew 4.5% from 2012 to 2015.  Homes in Grand Rapids (no. 1 in 2016) are by far the lowest priced of the list and significantly undervalued compared to history and local income. "Markets like Grand Rapids, Columbus and Atlanta still hold bargains," says Winzer. "All these markets have upside price potential without the risk of a local bubble." Just two California markets made this year's list. "We don't see Los Angeles or San Francisco in this list because they already are over-priced," notes Winzer. Sacramento, the state capital, rejoins the top 20 this year thanks in part to perfect pricing for the city's average income.  The first of two consecutive North Carolina markets to make the list, Charlotte  Raleigh  San Diego is the highest priced place on our list after gaining 6% last year. Unlike nearby Los Angeles, the city is not yet overvalued for the local income.
