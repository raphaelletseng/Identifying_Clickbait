71 Powerful Photos Of Women Protesting Throughout American History
As we celebrate the accomplishments of women during Women’s History Month , it’s essential that we also remember that there is still plenty to be fired up about. Just over a month into the Trump administration, women saw reproductive rights be chipped at almost  weekly , house speaker Paul Ryan said that he plans on defunding Planned Parenthood , and President Trump’s anti-immigration and anti-transgender legislation meant serious trouble for the nation’s most vulnerable women . But if there’s one thing American women know how to do, it’s resist. Just ask the millions of women who marched around the country on January 21. Or the civil rights activists who came before them. Or the suffragettes who came before that. To honor the revolutionary spirit of American women, we’ve rounded up 71 photos of women protesting throughout U.S. history to show just how strong that spirit is.

As we celebrate the accomplishments of women during Women’s History Month , it’s essential that we also remember that there is still plenty to be fired up about.

Just over a month into the Trump administration, women saw reproductive rights be chipped at almost weekly , house speaker Paul Ryan said that he plans on defunding Planned Parenthood , and President Trump’s anti-immigration and anti-transgender legislation meant serious trouble for the nation’s most vulnerable women .

But if there’s one thing American women know how to do, it’s resist. Just ask the millions of women who marched around the country on January 21. Or the civil rights activists who came before them. Or the suffragettes who came before that.

To honor the revolutionary spirit of American women, we’ve rounded up 71 photos of women protesting throughout U.S. history to show just how strong that spirit is.
