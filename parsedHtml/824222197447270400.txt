Four-year old appears on This Morning to speak about saving his mother's life - but is distracted by boats
heroic four-year-old who saved his mother's life appeared on This Morning to be interviewed about his brave deed, but the interview was interrupted when the small child was transfixed by boats out of the window. Philip Schofield, who was speaking to the child on air, dropped the interview in favour of playing with him. He was speaking to Jacob Onion’s mum Gemma, who had collapsed at home and was only woken up by her son after he had called 999. Mr Schofield left Holly Willoughby to host on her own as he went to peek at the ships with little Jacob. This was because the little boy couldn't sit still and was excitedly pointing out of the window at the passing boats. Viewers took to social media to praise the hosts, who did their best to entertain the child. How cute is @Schofe with the little lad showing him the boats. Live tv he doesn't care he's showing Jacob the boats #ThisMorning  pic.twitter.com/CrgRiW1ypn @thismorning Sat here in tears!!!

He then pushed around the toy with the four-year-old, who was clearly delighted. Jacob Onion showed bravery when his mother fell and hit her head. He tried to wake her up, then when that didn't work rang 999 and said: "Mummy is on the floor. Mummy has hurt herself. She isn’t talking."
