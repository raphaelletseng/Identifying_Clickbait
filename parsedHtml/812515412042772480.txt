Celebrity Weddings of 2016
Quite a few celebrity couples embarked on married life this year. From the lavish to the intimate, there were many ways for them to profess their love and pledge their lives to each other.

Suicide Squad star Margot Robbie married longtime love Tom Ackerley in a secret ceremony in Byron Bay, Australia, over the weekend of December 19. The 26-year-old actress wore a cream-colored off-the-shoulder dress and her hair in loose curls. (She skipped the veil.) Robbie and Ackerley exchanged vows in front of about 50 guests, who had to give up their cellphones for the honor to attend. Robbie was given away by her mother. Though she was hush-hush about the ceremony (and didnâ€™t even publicly ever announce she was engaged), Robbie took to Instagram shortly after to confirm the news with a simple, to-the-point picture of her ring finger, donning a sweet diamond sparkler.(Photo: Instagram)
