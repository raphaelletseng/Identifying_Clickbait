Donald Trump Said The Country Is Waiting For ‚ÄòEasy D,‚Äô And, Well, Yeah
On Wednesday, Donald Trump took to Twitter to once again to let people know about the immense danger we‚Äôre all in because of the foreigners pouring into the U.S. The president is still upset that his executive order banning entry for travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries is running into roadblocks in the courts. He hopes for a quick decision, a decision which he referred to as an ‚ÄúEASY D.‚Äù Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D! Well, as you can imagine, Twitter ran with that. In Twitter‚Äôs defense though, it is 11 years old. ü§î https://t.co/6s674G6h6i honestly it couldn‚Äôt have happened to a better egg, congrats to @EasyD  pic.twitter.com/H82nkODAx7 Easy D pic.twitter.com/kwbq4qpwHW When I see an Easy D, based largely on the accumulation of data pic.twitter.com/5IxoIlFqFt #EasyD  pic.twitter.com/DUgNB2SKgX Sure the Easy D may be nice but it's the D you really have to work for that's the most rewarding.
