Friar dog adopted by monastery becomes online sensation 
Shares               A sense of humor may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of a monastery, but it turns out some monks have a great one.   Photos posted to Facebook of a dog adopted by a Francisan monastery in Cochabamba, Bolivia, have gone viral. The poster, Kasper Mariusz Kapron OFM, wrote that his theology students started dressing the dog in traditional Franciscan garb as a "nice joke." (OFM stands for the Order of Friars Minor, a Roman Catholic order commonly known as the Franciscans.)   Friar Bigoton (Moustache), aka Carmelo, as the pup is called, is pictured running through the monastery, peering into a pool and being cuddled by several monks.   St. Francis of Assisi is the patron saint of animals and the founder of the Franciscan order.
