Old people are for life... not just for Christmas
Old people are for life... not just for Christmas
ld people. Don’t you just love them at Christmas ? Twinkling away in made-for-TV movies, popping up on chat shows (Graham Norton’s pretty old, right?) and snoozing in an armchair after lunch. Bless. Last year’s John Lewis advert, with that miserable, lonely bloke on a bench on the moon , was such a downer. And how unrealistic was that? I mean, how to live on the moon? When you think about it, old people make Christmas feel that bit more special. Traditional. It wouldn’t be the same without my Nan. She’s frailer and more shrunken than ever. It’s as though all the water in her is evaporating. Liver spots? I hope I never get those . Mum says she’s doing well after her spell in hospital, but because I only really see her at Christmas, I suppose I notice her deterioration more? But she’s cute… his, give or take a few minor details, pretty much sums up the average millennials’ approach...
