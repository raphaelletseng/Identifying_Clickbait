Modern day samurai captured in fascinating photoshoot


Dressed in traditional samurai outfits and photographed in grainy black and white, at first glance these images appear to show fearsome Japanese warriors during their feudal heyday.

In fact these are the modern-day samurai of Soma, in Fukushima, the area devastated by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear meltdown.

After the disaster photographer Everett Kennedy Brown, who had been based in the country for several decades, went to the area in order to connect with the people living there and document their experiences.

While there he met Michitane Soma, the head of a clan of samurai whose history stretches back more than 800 years, and was persuaded to photograph them using a technique popular in the 1850s to give the images an old-world feel.

Photographer Everett Kennedy Brown captured these old-world style images of modern-day samurai who are still living in Soma, Fukushima, one of the areas devastated by the 2011 Japan earthquake and nuclear disaster. Pictured, a man in traditional samurai clothing, including hakama - or pleated trousers originally designed to be worn on horseback - and a kataginu - a sleeveless jacket adopted by samurai towards the end of their existence

Brown traveled to the area around Fukushima in the wake of the disaster to document the experiences of people living there, and met Michitane Soma - the head of a samurai clan whose history stretches back 800 years. Pictured, two samurai in traditional dress, including geta, or wooden sandals, and a hachimaki - a headband which symbolises courage

Brown used the wet plate collodion process to make his old fashioned images, a technique that involves soaking a glass plate in chemicals before exposing it to light and then developing the image in a darkroom. Pictured, a samurai with both swords at his waist, including the famous katana or longsword, and the shorter wakizashi. Samurai always carried both, and would often fight with them simultaneously

The samurai first emerged in Japan in the Tohoku region around 800AD, becoming a firm fixture of society around 1100AD as the country entered its feudal age. They were expert warriors, but also literate and religious.

The samurai followed a code that became known as bushido, or 'the way of the warrior', a philosophy of combat that combined elements of Confucian teaching with Zen Buddhism. Pictured, a samurai holding a horagai or battle trumpet, made from a conch shell

Bushido emphasised the importance of self-discipline and control, respect for others and the community, selflessness in one's acts, and loyalty to one's master unto death

As well as being famed swordsmen, samurai were also expert archers and horsemen, and were especially skilled in firing bows from horseback. Pictured, a samurai in traditional dress including a shitagi, or white undershirt

Samurai armour started as simple protective plates to defend themselves in battle, but as their role changed to become more administrative, so the armour became more elaborate - often featuring large helmet-pieces and hair pommels

Officially there are no more samurai in Japan, as the class was abolished in 1868 at the end of Japan's feudal age, but there are still those who practice their traditions and dress as they would have dressed

During their history the samurai moved from simple swords for hire to Japan's elite social class, enjoying status as the protectors of the Shogun, or emperor, and adapted their role to become statesmen, writers and bureaucrats
