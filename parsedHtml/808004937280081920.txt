'SNL' Imagines a Day in the Life of Donald Trump in Nightmarish John Cena Sketch


If Donald Trump thought Saturday Night Live would go easy on him this week just because Alec Baldwin wasn’t in the building Saturday, well, he was sorely mistaken. In fact, host John Cena ended up being the perfect proxy for Baldwin-as-Trump, or at least for how Trump sees himself when he looks in the mirror.

SNL not only showed us how Trump sees himself—a physically immaculate specimen with really, really big hands—but also how he sees the rest of the world. In a sketch called “Through Donald’s Eyes,” we got a first person glimpse at life as Donald perceives it. It's basically a trippy fever dream occupied by enemies, cronies, beautiful women, and frantic tweets.

For instance, when he speaks to a Fox news anchor, Trump hears “Huge, huge success. Victory. Landslide. Fox News.” When he picks up a copy of The (failing) New York Times, Trump sees “FALSE REPORT, BIASED. Lies Lies Lies.”

Trump—whose braggadocio truly knows no bounds—has been accused of living in his own reality before, so this sketch really doesn’t seem that far-fetched, does it? And what if Trump really does see the world this way? What, then, will he see when he watches this sketch himself? Consider our minds officially melted.

Experience the world as Donald Trump sees it (if you dare) above.
