This historic bull market in stocks looks more like the 1980s than the 1920s


Â The DJIA (SPX) remains in a historic blowout to the uptrend from 2009. Although we have maintained our aggressively bullish stance during this time based on very similar price action to both 1929 and its copy, 1987, the countdown clock is wrong. It is wrong in time but not distance nor price. This week is the 415th week since the 2009 low exactly matching the rally before the 1929 crash and well beyond the 387 weeks into the 1987 crash.Â ThursdayÂ is 2002 days since the 2009 bottom, the same number of days from the 1921 bottom to the 1929 crash.



So is the market about to crash this week? It could potentially produce extreme volatility and what many will believe is the start of a crash. But it should only be a very small dress rehearsal. The candles ofÂ the 1929 birthday cake may quiver but they shouldÂ stay alight.

The Current Uptrend Matches the 1920s Bull Market

But not quite as closely as the 1980s Bull Market

We frequently make the point that volatility is the hardest market variable to gauge. Direction is often much easier. There are many reasons why volatility (distance/time) can itself be so volatile. But the reasons all stem from a change in positions in the market due to a shift in one of the keyÂ FITS Drivers:



Fundamentals - events,

- events, Intermarket - another market movement,

- another market movement, Technicals - a break true or false -

- a break true or false - Sentiment - the willingness of traders to keep or change positions.

Â For much of the 2014-2015 consolidation we became increasingly aware that this historic uptrend was taking longer than its two sisters but that it still needed the truly aggressive blowout to complete. But until Donald Trump's election provided both the volatility and cause we were unaware of what would produce such dramatic volatility. Given the need to 'catch up' with the historic templates we assumed that the typical rising US rates, Dollar and stocks ('Trump On') associated with this last phase represented the very last phase.

However, of theÂ four key characteristicsÂ of fractals or accurate historical comparisons,Â timeÂ orÂ distance divided byÂ time, in other words volatility, are the most variable.Â ContextÂ andÂ price actionÂ are far more important.

Having arrived at the 1929 anniversary, it is clear that only time matches the very top. Donald Trump'sÂ election did not represent the start of the last leg of the uptrend but only the most aggressive part of that uptrend.Â

The evidence is clear from both the 1987 chart and the narrative (context).

Â

Indeed the potential volatility this week due to the Trump-Abe talks or indeed Janet Yellen's Humphrey Hawkins speech on Tuesday and Wednesday, the day before 1929's birthday would not be unexpected given the strong similarity between last Friday and January 22nd 1987. Even USDJPY is displaying a likeness to current price action.

What does this mean in practice?

Two-way volatility is likely this week in many markets before a resumption of the medium term blowout in stocks. We will change our Countdown Clock to reflect the historic price and percentages more closely - once we have seen the price action of the next 24 hours or so. This revision does not affect our trading strategy or view on any market we cover. In fact it is an affirmation of that strategy. But the revision will allow price action to reflect the narrative more closely and therefore increase the probability of our approach. Expectations of a Trump inspired inflationary growth due to increased government expenditure and tax breaks should be borne out most in higher inflated stocks. But until when? Until perma-bears (those who continue to pick a top) have given up the ghost of a 1929 or 1987 crash. But more importantly, when the effects of an inflationary expansion funded by government borrowing at least start to show. When it becomes apparent the Trump Effect is not sustainable.

The jury on the Trump Presidency will have 4 years to sit. But for now, many of them are singing Happy Birthday 1929 and are too busy to blow out the candles.
