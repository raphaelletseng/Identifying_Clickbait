Seven 'Green' Buildings From Around The World Prove That Architecture Can Be Environment-Friendly China is building Asia's first 'vertical forest' that will produce 60,000 Kg of Oxygen every day. This building is going to be an amalgamation of utility and sustainability and if built to success then proving that architecture and clean environment can go hand in hand. Though the Nanjing Towers will be literally green, such green buildings can also look modern but be sustainable. Here are other seven such buildings from around the world that look absolutely attractive and serve the planet with clean air: Also read: Asia's First Vertical Forest Is Being Built In China Which Will Produce 60 Kg Oxygen Every Day! 1. Manitoba Hydro Place in Winnipeg, Canada This is one of North America's most energy-efficient offices with its geothermal system that naturally heats and cools the building. 2. World Trade Centre in Bahrain This is a 240-metre-high twin tower complex located in Manama, Bahrain. It uses wind turbines to optimise power outputs.Â The two towers are linked via three skybridges, each holding a 225 kW wind turbine, totalling to 675 kW of wind power capacity. The wind turbines are expected to provide 11% to 15% of the towers' total power consumption, or approximately 1.1 to 1.3 GWh a year. This is equivalent to providing the lighting for about 300 homes, 258 hospitals, 17 industrial plants, and 33 car engines. 3.
