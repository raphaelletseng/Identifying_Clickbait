Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is due to deliver the country's economic report card to the National People's Congress (NPC) in the capital Beijing.

More than 3,000 legislators are meeting in the Great Hall of the People starting Sunday for 10 days.

They are expected to discuss ways to reform the economy while tackling pollution that has sparked public anger.

The Chinese economy expanded at its slowest pace in 26 years in 2016.

The rubber-stamp parliament and its advisory body hold ceremonial meetings every year known as "lianghui" or "two sessions".

The NPC's advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, began its meeting on Friday.

State news agency Xinhua said legislators and advisors would, among other issues, discuss globalisation "at a time when certain Western powers are retreating into protectionism and isolation".

The meetings are the first since the election of US President Donald Trump, who has called for higher tariffs on Chinese imports.

Xinhua also reported that national defence and relations with Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau would also be discussed.

Prime Minister Li is also expected to provide more detail on Sunday about the country's defence budget, which is planned to rise by 7%.

This year's "lianghui" comes ahead of a major Chinese Communist Party congress, due to be held later this year.

That congress will confirm party chief and president Xi Jinping's second term in office, as well as announce changes in the party's top leadership.
