Queen Elizabeth: 90-year-old monarch to step back from some charity work

Updated

Queen Elizabeth II will step down as patron of a number of national organisations in the coming months after she turned 90 in April, Buckingham Palace has announced.

The Palace said her patronage of leading children's charities like the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and Save the Children UK, will be passed on to other members of the Royal family in due course.

She will also hand over her patronage of sporting groups like the Lawn Tennis Association and the Rugby Football Union and academic groups like the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Royal Geographic Society.

"Her Majesty will continue to serve as patron to hundreds of charities and institutions but will now share this work with her family," the statement said.

Aides and commentators say there is no prospect of her giving up her job, and Buckingham Palace said she would remain patron of more than 600 organisations.

The Royal office named a total of 25 national groups which will be handed over to existing royal family vice-patrons or presidents as she comes to the end of her 90th year.

Queen Elizabeth's husband Prince Philip also resigned from a number of patronages when he turned 90 in 2011.

The Royal website says the Queen sees public and voluntary service as one of the most important elements of her work.

The Queen is the world's longest-reigning living monarch.

Born on April 21, 1926 in central London, Elizabeth still hosts foreign dignitaries, presides over the annual state opening of parliament and holds a weekly audience with the prime minister, but has cut back on foreign travel in recent years.
