People Are Taking Their Frustrations Out On United Airlines By Trolling Them Hard
According to passengers, the flight was overbooked by four people . After no passengers volunteered to give up their seat, security guards were called in and physically removed a man from his seat and dragged him off the plane. The man shown being dragged by security apparently told them that he was a doctor and needed to see patients the next day. In a statement following the incident, United said they "[apologized] for the overbook situation." This, of course, also follows the leggings incident last month. In that instance, the company stopped three young girls from boarding a flight because they were not in compliance with a dress code required for "company benefit travel."
