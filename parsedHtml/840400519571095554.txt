'Andre Drummond After Guest Verse in Rap Song: 'I’m Not a Rapper'
Andre Drummond showed us he had interest in rap last summer when he hopped on the #SoGoneChallenge bandwagon. Was he any good? Well, you be the judge. #SoFarGoneChallenge A post shared by Andre Drummond (@andredrummondd) on Sep 16, 2016 at 3:09pm PDT Drummond’s interest in hip-hop is in the news again because he spit a guest verse on a track for Detroit rapper Nate Nixen. My guy, Detroit Pistons Center & NBA Allstar @andredrummondd put some fire on my #first59 PT. 27 Produced by super producer @julogettheracks 🏀🏀🏀 If u think it was dope.

Might we have another Damian Lillard on our hands? Is this the classic case of “NBA star wants to be a rapper” a la Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, and many others? No, says Drummond. He was quick to let folks know he is well aware he’s not a rapper. “Don’t panic,” he told fans, emphasizing that basketball is his focus. Just a heads up, I'm not a rapper. I just made a freestyle for fun. My focus is basketball and basketball only. So don't panic 😅😅😂 And, naturally, Lillard got involved. A fan asked him on Twitter whether Drummond was a better rapper than him, and well… 🤔 BOY lol https://t.co/pbwJvfgOq4
