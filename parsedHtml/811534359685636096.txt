Twitter descended into a meltdown after Fox News' commentator Bill O'Reilly lashed out at an alleged "liberal conspiracy" from the left to take power away from the "white establishment".

"This is all about race. The left sees white privilege in America as an oppressive force that must be done away with. Therefore white working class voters must be marginalised," he argued on the O'Reilly Factor.
