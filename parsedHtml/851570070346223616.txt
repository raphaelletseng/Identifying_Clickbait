2 including teacher reported dead in shooting at San Bernardino elementary school


A shooting at North Park Elementary School in San Bernardino, California, left two dead on Monday, according to multiple reports.

One female teacher and a male suspect are dead, and two students have been airlifted to a local hospitalÂ in critical condition, according to the local newsÂ outlets.

The police did not engage the shooter, who appeared to have killed himself, the local news affiliate CBS Los Angeles reported.

"We believe this to be a murder-suicide," San Bernardino Chief of Police Jarrod Burguan said on Twitter, adding that the shooting appeared to have happened in a classroom.

"Police operations are continuing to secure the area. However, we do believe the threat is down," Burguan said in a separate tweet. The children have been transferred away from the site.

Multiple sources have pointed to domestic violence as the possible motive for the shooting.

A nearby California state university has ordered a shelter-in-place, and firefighters have created a triage area to access and treat the wounded, NBC LA reported.
