5 Strange 'Simpsons' Things You Haven't Seen, Even After 30 Years
5 Strange 'Simpsons' Things You Haven't Seen, Even After 30 Years
When the Simpson family first appeared on television ― all the way back on April 19, 1987 ― their yellow bodies with odd hair surely seemed novel. Now 30 years later, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie are positively quotidian. After graduating from a recurring sketch on “The Tracey Ullman Show” to a full-fledged series “The Simpsons,” this family became a guiding compass for countless other television programs, perhaps at the cost of forgetting how revolutionary it felt in its early years. A true testament to the show’s greatness, however, is how much this on-screen family inspired pop culture outside of the television space. The Simpsons have become more than television characters, but masterpieces of American culture that artists have wanted to parody, break down and build up into something new. Below are a few of the more amazing and strange jokes and art projects from recent years that wouldn’t exist without this beautifully peculiar family. The karaoke room that offers the two-word theme song.

A former writer for the show, Bill Oakley, happened across the option and shared a picture of the karaoke screen on Twitter. The photo immediately went viral. Oakley told the full story to HuffPost over an email: I was at karaoke with my family and my kids. We go to a place in Portland called Voicebox where you get private rooms. I was looking through the section called “TV Theme Songs” which is stuff like the “Addams Family,” “Brady Bunch,” etc. and saw that they had “The Simpsons.” I couldn’t believe it. I ordered it up and it played and I was amazed. I did not actually sing it, sadly, because our time was up and we were vacating the room but I did manage to snap that photo. I tweeted it about  The music genre, “Simpsonwave,” that actually got popular. This artistic offshoot takes a bit more contextual explaining. On Facebook, there’s a whole community of people who create jokes about “The Simpsons” in a style called “shitposting.” You don’t really need to know what that is, but basically the jokes are often darker and weirder than what would actually ever appear on “The Simpsons.” In any case, one of these community members, Lucien Hughes, decided to start combining video clips from “The Simpsons” with an electronic music genre called “vaporwave” ― creating what would eventually be deemed “Simpsonwave.” Hughes wasn’t the first to make such a combination, but he arguably popularized the nascent “form.” Hughes’ “Simpsonwave” videos have earned millions of views on YouTube in just about a year. Here’s Hughes talking to Pitchfork about what appealed to him about making these videos: Vaporwave and its associated sub-genres go hand-in-hand with “The Simpsons” because of the combined hit of nostalgia. “The Simpsons” is pretty unique in that it’s something that almost everyone born between the late ’80s and early ’00s grew up watching. Vaporwave is very much about creating an atmosphere of nostalgia, so I feel “The Simpsons” just perfectly fits the whole aesthetic. Below is arguably the first Simpsonwave video.

I always found them funny, with the colors all mixed up. I remember going to Western International Market and seeing the Bart Marley shirts. In 2003 I got myself a couple of Bootleg Bart shirts for a laugh. Whenever friends or family went on holiday and asked if I wanted anything, I would always say “a Bootleg Bart shirt.” I was introduced to social sites and thought it would be cool to start up my own little page sharing my shirts and other bootleg “Simpsons” images that I had found.

The artist Yoann Hervo planned to participate in an animation project to commemorate the show’s 25th anniversary, where various animators would write and create a mini story of their own as though it were in “The Simpsons” universe. Ultimately, Hervo decided it was too hard to top the original’s writing without seeming derivative, and instead went in a much different direction to create this amazing alternate opener . In an email to HuffPost, Hervo explained the thinking behind his short: Many animation directors have already practiced this exercise [of creating a new opener]. It’s similar to adopt a Jazz standard in a way… The idea was to keep the structure of the opening and its dynamic pace ― all the rest of it (tone, action, graphics, etc.) is more and leaves room to interpretation. I’ve tried to everything ― to reach to something more chaotic: changing order of shots and their speed; getting a random art direction for every sequence and an experimental theme. With this conception I lost the essence of “The Simpsons” opening ― in addition to losing the usual audience of the series. That said, I’ve withdrawn the most pleasant part of the opening, the climax of every Simpsons fans: the couch gag. I thought it was a bit excessive to end on a final gag while the whole opening was a joke. It’s funnier though ― ending on nothing ― an empty couch. It was more about telling a joke with no punchline: the audience is waiting ― nothing happens ― and everyone is frustrated ... a bit like in the real life in a way. ALSO ON HUFFPOST MORE:

Starting with the least strange and arty of this list, there’s a karaoke bar in Portland, Oregon (because of course), that offers “The Simpsons” theme song as an option.

A former writer for the show, Bill Oakley, happened across the option and shared a picture of the karaoke screen on Twitter. The photo immediately went viral.

The music genre, “Simpsonwave,” that actually got popular.
