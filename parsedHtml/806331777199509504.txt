Stunning aerial images have revealed remnants from the Pacific conflict in the Second World War which are strewn across forests, shorelines and beaches of islands in the Pacific Ocean.

The remnants were photographed on the Northern Mariana Islands, Solomon Islands and the Rock Islands in Palau.

They include tanks, tractors, artillery, shipwrecks, including naval transport vessels, debris from Japanese Imperial Navy destroyers and even personal items from soldiers such as helmets.

The Pacific conflict, often referred to as the Pacific Theatre, was part of the Second World War where Japanese forces fought primarily against the US Navy, US Marine Corps and US Army.

The UK, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and other Allied nations also contributed forces until a turning point in the war - the defeat of the Japanese at Guadalcanal in February 1943.

There were more than 41,000 US Army ground troop causalities, while the Marine Corps and Navy corpsmen suffered total casualties of 23,160.
