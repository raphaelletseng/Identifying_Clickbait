Hereâs how I spent a weekend eating and sightseeing in New York City for less than $50


Between Broadway shows, toweringÂ department stores, and $200-a-head tasting menus, New York City has no shortage of ways to blow all your cash.

But, luckily, the city is also home to plenty of affordable activities that make it possible to live here without going bankrupt. So when my friend Kelly came up from Philadelphia for a recent weekend visit, I intendedÂ to strike a balance betweenÂ showing her the magic of New York and sticking to my budget.Â

Kelly agreed. Thanks toÂ multiple weddings,Â bridal showers, and bachelorette parties on both our schedules for the fall, we knew we wanted to keep our weekend together cheap.Â

DespiteÂ aimingÂ to keep our expenses low, we still managed to fit in plenty of food, exploring, and classic New York sightseeing. In total, we spent less than $50 per person on food and activities for the entire weekend.

Here's everything we were able to fit in.
