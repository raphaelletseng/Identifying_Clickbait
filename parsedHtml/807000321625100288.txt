Legendary astronaut John Glenn's inspiring life in photos


On Thursday, American hero, NASA astronaut and former U.S. senator John Glenn died at the age of 95.

His life was marked by record-breaking feats and a commitment to public service.

Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth as part of the Friendship 7 mission, which launched to space on Feb. 20, 1962. After retiring from NASA, Glenn served as a U.S. senator representing Ohio.

He flew to space once more in 1998 when he was 77-years-old, setting yet another record as the oldest person ever to fly to space.

Glenn was the last surviving member of his astronaut class, the first in NASA history, dubbed the Mercury 7.
