The Chicago Sky officially traded Elena Delle Donne to the Washington Mystics in a blockbuster deal Thursday.

Chicago received center Stefanie Dolson, Kahleah Copper and the second overall pick in this year's draft in return.

Howard Megdal of the New York Times first reported the deal on Jan. 30. Delle Donne, the 2015 WNBA MVP, is one of the league's biggest and most recognizable stars.

Dolson, who played collegiately at powerhouse Connecticut, was a 2015 All-Star. Copper was the seventh overall pick in last year's draft and averaged 6.2 points and 3.1 rebounds per game as a rookie.

Delle Donne was the face of the Sky franchise after the team drafted her second overall behind Brittney Griner in 2013. Delle Donne was set to become a restricted free agent this offseason, which means Chicago would have had the right to match any offer she received.

Sky owner Michael Alter confirmed the deal to Megdal, but Delle Donne's agent, Erin Kane, said the reported swap had not been completed, per Sean Morrison of espnW.com.

Kane said the trade cannot go through until Chicago signs Delle Donne, and the agent and player have not seen the contract or signed it. Morrison noted Delle Donne "will likely agree to [the] terms of a sign-and-trade" Wednesday.

In four WNBA seasons, Delle Donne has averaged 20.5 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game behind 38.1 percent shooting from three-point range. She was particularly impressive during her MVP campaign and led the Sky to the WNBA Finals in 2014, when they lost to the Phoenix Mercury:

Delle Donne will now play alongside promising 23-year-old Belgian center Emma Meesseman—who averaged 15.2 points per game in 2016—and look to turn around a team that finished a disappointing 13-21 in 2016.
