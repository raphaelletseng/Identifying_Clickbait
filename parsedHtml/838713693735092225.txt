Glastonbury line-up leak? Ed Sheeran, Diana Ross and Lorde among alleged performers
istorically Glastonbury line-ups aren't revealed until weeks before the event itself, but that appears not to be the case for this year's festival, as a pretty convincing line-up has apparently been leaked online. The festival timetable site Clashfinder uploaded an incredibly detailed line-up this weekend, including timeslots and stages, revealing that the acts due to perform at this year's event include previously announced headliners Radiohead and Foo Fighters , long-rumoured headliner Ed Sheeran, and artists including Lorde , Diana Ross and Rag'n'Bone Man . hile there has yet to be any confirmation or denial as to its authenticity, Clashfinder being a publicly-edited website, it's a remarkably believable line-up of acts. According to the site, Friday will see performances from the likes of Run the Jewels, Blood Orange, Clean Bandit, Craig David and Kris Kristofferson, with Radiohead closing the night. Saturday will reportedly feature acts including Solange, Stormzy, Rag'n'Bone Man, HAIM and Van Morrison , while Sunday's performers will include Ed Sheeran , Lorde, The XX, Barry Gibb and Diana Ross.
