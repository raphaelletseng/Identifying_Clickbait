Story highlights California enjoying a wildflower super bloom

The burst of foliage can be seen from satellite images

(CNN) Southern California is enjoying a wildflower "super bloom" after years of extreme drought.

The state had been under a drought state of emergency since 2014, but Gov. Jerry Brown lifted the order for all but four counties , earlier this month.

The wet winter strained reservoirs to the max and replenished mountain snowpacks, which are now at 164 percent of the season average.

You can see the difference from space. Satellite images shot in December, 2016, and March of this year show a dramatic increase in greenery.

The view from the ground is even more spectacular.
