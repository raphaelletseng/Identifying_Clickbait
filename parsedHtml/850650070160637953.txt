The 10 most effective ad campaigns this year
The 10 most effective ad campaigns this year


Online advertising service Warc has released its 2017 rankings of the world's 100 most effective advertising campaigns.

Unlike the ranking from 2016, when Droga5 dominated with three of the top ten ads, 2017 had no single standout agency.

Each of the top five campaigns were characterised by the use of technology to target and reach consumers at the right moment and strong multi-platform strategies that ensured consumers got the full story.

Stunts were also a big deal: Two of the top five were event-based. Not to forget the traditional medium of TV, which was one of the driving factors in generating a strong return on investment.

The campaigns were ranked in partnership with King's College London according to a points score calculated with a "rigorous methodology" using data from ad award ceremonies around the world. The assessment included the campaign's impact, industry perception, and the level of competition it faced. For each competition a particular campaign won, its award points were multiplied by the rating of the competition.
