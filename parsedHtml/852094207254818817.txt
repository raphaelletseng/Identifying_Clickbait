Thirsty pig shows up a group of friends by chugging bottles of beer


A video has emerged of a thirsty pig chugging three bottles of beer in front of a group of chuckling friends.

The footage starts with the pig, seemingly outside a bar, skilfully picking up an empty bottle before dropping it to the floor when it realises there is no beer left inside.

One of the onlookers then hands the hog a full of bottle of beer which it gratefully downs in seconds.

When the pig finishes the beverage it again drops the bottle to the ground and looks for another.

The animal then finds another full bottle that was being rested on the ground by a drinker and promptly chugs its contents down as the onlookers erupt with laughter.

After seeing no bottles available in the immediate area the pig waits until one of the men watching the hilarious scene unfold hand it the dregs of his beer, which its downs in a matter of seconds once again.

Not content with its alcohol fix the pig then picks up one of the bottles it had finished moments earlier, ensuring it had consumed all the beer it could have.

The caption with the clip, which was uploaded to video sharing website LiveLeak on Monday, says the footage was taken in Mexico .

The video has been generally well received although some viewers claimed the pig is a victim of animal abuse.

One viewer remarked: 'They've turned the pig into an alcoholic. As funny as you think it is, it's animal abuse.'

But another said: 'That was nice of those gentleman to share their beers.'
