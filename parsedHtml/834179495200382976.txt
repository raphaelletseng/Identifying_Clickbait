The Chicago Bears are hoping to rebuild this offseason—and that starts with the quarterback position.

According to ESPN's Jeff Darlington, the team has "begun actively shopping" Jay Cutler.

Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the trade discussion has been going on since mid-January.

Injuries limited the 33-year-old to just five games last season as he finished with just four touchdowns and five interceptions. His 78.1 quarterback rating was the second-worst of his career.

His 27.8 Total QBR would have been the worst in the NFL if he had had enough pass attempts to qualify, per ESPN.com.

Cutler signed a seven-year extension in 2014 worth $126.7 million. However, Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk noted at the time only the first three seasons were fully guaranteed, making it a year-to-year option starting in 2017.

Considering the team has just a 12-23 record with Cutler as a starter over the past three seasons, it makes sense for the organization to move in a different direction.
