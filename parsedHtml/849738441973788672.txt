'Inebriated' Teacher Let Minor Drive Her to Waffle House: Cops

A Florida high school math teacher made a miscalculation when she let a 14-year-old drive her to Waffle House while she was drunk, authorities said.

Terra Virgin, 32, was arrested Sunday night on charges of child neglect and permitting an unauthorized minor to drive in Tampa, Florida.

Virgin, a teacher at Freedom High School, told investigators she had five beers before she started craving for a meal and convinced the teen to give her a ride.

When officers pulled over the car, they found the teen behind the wheel and Virgin had an open beer can on her lap.

Tampa Police Department spokesman Steve Hegarty said Virgin was "quite inebriated" and was aware that the 14-year-old boy did not have a drivers license, NBC Affliate WFLA reported.

"You can see perhaps what the thought process was,” said Hegarty. "Apparently, she had been doing some drinking, decided she wanted to go to Waffle House. Thought, wisely, that she was not in any kind of shape to drive, but getting a 14-year-old, who doesn’t have a license to drive, is not a good idea."

Virgin was booked into the Hillsborough County Jail and released Monday on a $2,250 bond. An attorney wasn't listed.

A spokesperson for Hillsborough County Schools said the Office of Professional Standards will determine Virgin’s employment status.
