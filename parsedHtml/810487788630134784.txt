McDonald’s is launching its own home delivery service in three Florida markets next month thanks to a partnership with UberEats.

Beginning late January 2017, the fast food restaurant will begin testing its delivery option at nearly 200 restaurants in Orlando, Tampa, and Miami in the new year. Just like Uber’s flagship mobile application, users will be able to track the progress and delivery progress of their order.

Customers will be able to use the UberEats website or mobile application to have their orders delivered by Uber drivers.

This is another sign of McDonald’s getting with the times to become more accessible to its customers. Earlier this year, the fast food chain added self-order kiosks to more than 500 restaurants across the states. They’re also planning on integrating the kiosks at locations in Chicago and Boston.

Last year, McDonald’s first tested home delivery in New York City with Postmates, a third-party delivery service based in San Francisco, who are official partners with Chili’s, Chipotle, and Panda Express.

The company plans to launch their own mobile app for customers in 2017. According to CNBC, similar chains like Starbucks, Domino’s, and Taco Bell have all seen a spike in sales numbers because of mobile apps that offer order-to-pay options.
