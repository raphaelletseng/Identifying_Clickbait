A woman believed to have been deliberately set on fire is in a critical condition after an incident at Park Holme in Adelaide's south on Saturday.

Police were called to the home on Rotorua Avenue just after midday, where a 29-year-old woman and a 43-year-old man suffered burns.

Police said the woman suffered burns to most of her body and the pair had been taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital.

Police praised neighbours who came to the aid of the burning woman.

"There were a number of people who came to the aid of this woman and this man and, as I said, they're providing statements and assisting with the investigation," Chief Inspector Julie Thomas said.

The woman is believed to have rushed out of the house engulfed in flames.

The couple's next-door neighbour said it was a distressing thing to happen in a usually sleepy street.

"Very quiet, yeah, no problems with anybody. Nobody has noisy parties or anything," Alex Manson said.

"It was obviously quite distressing to see someone on fire," Chief Inspector Thomas said.
