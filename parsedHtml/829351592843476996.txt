Overnight on Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren read a letter by Coretta Scott King — widow of Martin Luther King Jr. — opposing Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986 during a debate over the Alabama senator’s nomination to be attorney general.  However, she was prevented from doing so after Senate Republicans — led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — invoked an arcane rule to stop her from speaking, winning a vote by 49–43.  Warren had previously been a warned about violating the rule, but expressed her surprise that Coretta Scott King’s words were considered “not suitable for debate in the United States Senate” after she was told to take her seat. Later, McConnell defended his actions, and said: “Sen. Warren was giving a lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”  The statement only served as a rallying cry for feminists and Warren’s progressive base, and soon “nevertheless, she persisted” and the hashtag #LetLizSpeak were being widely shared on Twitter. brb getting "nevertheless, she persisted" tattooed on my body. #letlizspeak "Nevertheless, she persisted" | Man, the future is definitely FEMALE. “[Warren] was warned.
