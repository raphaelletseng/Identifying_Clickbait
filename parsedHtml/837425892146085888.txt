People Are Desperately Waiting For Nicki Minaj To Respond To Remy Ma's Diss Track
ICYMI, Remy Ma released a scathing diss track about Nicki Minaj on Saturday and hip hop hasn‚Äôt really been the same since. Seven-minute ‚ÄúShether‚Äù is basically a Pulitzer-worthy investigation into every aspect of Minaj‚Äôs life: raps, money, sex life, body, family ‚Äì you name it, it was mentioned. Ever since, the world has been waiting with bated breath for Minaj to respond with a follow-up diss track, as is custom in any respectable rap beef. But she‚Äôs just been posting lifestyle photos and tweeting stats, instead. And well, fans are confused. @NICKIMINAJ You can post a bunch of pictures of yourself but you can't post up a diss track after getting dragged b‚Ä¶ https://t.co/dPRVZedhin Upset. @NICKIMINAJ @hm BARBZ ARE WAITING NICKI!
