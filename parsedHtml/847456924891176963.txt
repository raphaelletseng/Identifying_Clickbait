WATCH: Are schools bullying trans students?

Data may be boring, but it matters

The U.S. Census may be a stale survey many loathe participating in, but it actually has immense importance for marginalized groups.

Data helps put hard facts behind the discrimination and bias facing those most at risk. Data can also help illuminate where federal funding needs to be allocated and legislation needs to be introduced to improve the lives of marginalized citizens.

Yes, there are things you can do to help — really

LGBTQ advocacy organizations are encouraging LGBTQ people and allies to call their representatives to voice their opposition to the erasure. Tell your rep why U.S. Census data is important, and why LGBTQ people deserve to be counted.

But, in lieu of U.S. Census data, many organizations have been working to collect information of the lives and needs of LGBTQ people for years. Consider supporting their efforts, and keeping up with their data:

Williams Institute , a championed UCLA think tank facilitating independent and wide-reaching research on LGBTQ identities

National Center for Transgender Equality , a social justice advocacy organization winning life-saving change for transgender people

SAGE , collecting data and supporting the needs of LGBTQ elders

GLSEN , a national education organization collecting data on LGBTQ students and school climate

Anti-Violence Project, collecting data on the LGBTQ community around hate violence, sexual violence, intimate-partner violence and systemic violence.
