Hoyer on Blocking ObamaCare Repeal: GOP Has No Replacement Ready

Hoyer on Blocking ObamaCare Repeal: GOP Has No Replacement Ready // // // // // House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland), the second-highest ranking Democrat in the House, said Republicans have no purposeful replacement of ObamaCare ready for when they send a repeal bill to President-elect Donald Trump's desk. Chris Stirewalt said Hoyer and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have pledged to block the repeal of ObamaCare. Hoyer said his fellow House Democrats will be unable to stop a "partial-repeal" bill from passage, but noted that Republican ranks are split on how to proceed with the Affordable Care Act's repeal. Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.), an ophthalmologist, has said it would be wrong to pass a full repeal of ObamaCare without a replacement bill ready to be passed, Hoyer said. The St. Marys Democrat said despite ObamaCare being passed on a solely partisan basis, he wanted to work with Republicans to craft the legislation. He said Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) "ultimately said no" to crafting a bipartisan plan with then-Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Montana). ObamaCare has to be fixed, Hoyer said, but it "did what it's set out to do."
