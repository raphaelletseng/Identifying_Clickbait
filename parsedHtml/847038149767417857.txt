Rahul Raj Feels Kamya Punjabi Releasing Pratyusha Banerjee's Short Film Is A Publicity Stunt Anandi of television, Pratyusha Banerjee who committed suicide, last year in April, is back in news again. Her BFF Kamya Punjabi is all set to release her short film 'Hum Kuchh Kah Na Sakey' that she shot right before her untimely death but looks like Pratyusha's former boyfriend Rahul Raj has a problem with that. Rahul feels Kamya and the makers of the film are trying to seek publicity. He also said that Pratyusha never shot for the film. Speaking to a leading daily, Rahul said, “If you see the promo, it shows a chubbier Pratyusha. This was how she looked two years ago when she had gained weight. Instead of garnering publicity in her name, let her rest in peace.” We really hope the movie turns out to be a tribute to Pratyusha and not a mere publicity stunt.
