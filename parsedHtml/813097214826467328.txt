German department store's VERY rude window display


Shoppers in Germany have been left stunned by one department store's very rude window display.

It appeared to show robotic animal toys mating.

One monkey was trying to mate with an elephant's trunk and another appeared to be colluding with a bear.

One British tourist, who walked past the store called Galeria Kauhof in Bonn, eastern Germany, could not believe her eyes.

She said: 'My friend Tara and I were a bit taken aback, it's not really what you would expect to see in a shop window at Christmas time.

'The weirdest part was that no one else seemed shocked by the display apart from us, everyone was acting like it was totally normal which I didn't understand.'

Laura Ingate posted a video of the shop on snapchat, writing: 'Excuse me! I feel very uncomfortable about this shop window.'

It has been speculated that the store put up the raunchy display to catch customers' attention at a time when many are shopping online instead.

Retail analysts say millions of Britons will spend the Christmas break searching for bargains from Christmas Eve – predicting as much as £9billion could be spent throughout the Christmas period until the new year.

Partly thanks to the rise of online shopping, Christmas Day itself has become a big day for shopping as people ditch party games and the Queen's speech to look for deals – and retailers expect record takings this year.

Web retail trade body IMRG predicts that spending online will rise by 10.1per cent to a new Christmas Day record of £805million.

The figure for Boxing Day is expected to soar by 15 per cent to a new high of £984million.
