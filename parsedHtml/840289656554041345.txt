People Think Nicki Minaj's "Regret in Your Tears" Is About Meek Mill
People Think Nicki Minaj's "Regret in Your Tears" Is About Meek Mill
Last night, Nicki Minaj dropped a trio of new singles . While the internet has been buzzing over Nicki finally clapping back at Remy Ma's "shETHER" on her Drake and Lil' Wayne-assisted "No Frauds," they are missing one of the bigger stories with these tracks. No, it isn't that Nicki put Remy on notice ; it's "Regret In Your Tears," a track that some people think sounds like Nicki lamenting on her relationship with Meek Mill after their breakup back in January . The hook on the song seems like the most obvious place where that line of thinking would come from, with Nicki saying, "Regret in your tears, now you taste 'em/'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em." She follows that up with, "I just want the memories, tried to make some with you/Now I gotta erase some with you." It's easy to see why people would go down that route, and they are most definitely jumping on that bandwagon. Okay i gotta give it to you @NICKIMINAJ for "Regret in your tears". Man @MeekMill took another L. Dammit! I knew it. Regret In Your Tears is a song about Meek Mill for hurting her feelings🤧🤐😢😡😩 this song is like save me On the low I know meek mill hurt double time!!!! Drake on her diss track n then he gotta hear "regret in your tears" 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ dawg L Regret in your tears is a hit ... and meek mill gone cry to it So regret in your tears is clearly about meek mill right I respect Nicki for that song abt meek.. bc she not tryna act all hard.. she's saying straight up nigga u hurt me; but imma b ok.. That last one? Nicki actually liked it. Not to say that that's 100 percent confirmation, but given the timeline, it just makes sense. And it's also smart business; not only has she topped the iTunes charts with the song dealing with Remy, but another one of her singles speaks on another fact of her life, in an entirely different style. She got that one off, and has owned the conversation all day.
