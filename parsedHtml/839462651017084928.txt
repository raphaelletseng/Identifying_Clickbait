After Her Dad Was Jailed & Mom Remarried, This 5YO Has Been Taking Care Of Her Grandmothers! Children have a very special bond with their grandparents. They are two generations removed but their bond transcends that space and time because the love is just too special and just too strong. Holding true to this is one family where a 5-year-old girl has been found to be the sole caretaker of two of her grandmothers. The child, Wang Anna, lives in a desolate mountainside in the Zunyi city of southwest China, with her ailing grandmother and 92-year-old great-grandmother. Anna's story is a moving one. She was three-months-old when her father was put in jail, leaving her mother to fend for herself and his parents. However, Anna was left alone to care for her grandmothers after her mother remarried elsewhere, reports . Anna now singlehandedly cares for her family where she not only cleans the house but also cooks meals for her grandmas who are both bedridden. The kid never complains and is ever-ready to take them out for a walk and to the washroom. But when they say that God loves children more, it's probably true for Anna has amazing neighbours who often take her to their farm to pick fresh vegetables whenever her family runs out of food. When asked by a reporter who visited Anna's home if she likes what she does, Anna said she loved taking care of her grandmoms and wished them "good health."
