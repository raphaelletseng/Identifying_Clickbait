Activist Tamika Mallory, one of the founders of the Women's March movement, sits in the back of a police van Wednesday, March 8, after being detained for blocking traffic outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York. Thirteen women outside the hotel were arrested for disorderly conduct during the "Day Without a Woman" march, a spokesman for the New York Police Department said. The Women's March tweeted: "Many of our national organizers have been arrested in an act of civil disobedience. We will not be silent."
