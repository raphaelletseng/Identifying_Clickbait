Paxton had completed work in December on the 13-episode first season of the midseason CBS drama, a reboot of Antoine Fuqua’s 2001 film. There are eight more unaired episodes after tonight’s.



Training Day is set 15 years after the events in the movie, and centers on an idealistic young police officer, Kyle Craig (Justin Cornwell), who is appointed to an elite squad of the LAPD where he is partnered with a seasoned, morally ambiguous detective Frank Roarke (Paxton).

The series is not expected to return next season.
