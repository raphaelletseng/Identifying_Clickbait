Funniest holiday photobombs of all time
Are these the funniest holiday photobombs of all time?


We all take holiday photos to preserve happy memories.

But some of these snaps unwittingly shot to fame for very different reasons.

Take the tourist who was mid-pose when a camel lurched in from behind her and chomped its jaws around her head.

Or the woman halfway through a bikini shot, seemingly unaware of the giggling beachgoer further out to sea who is imitating her moves.

Other shots inadvertently capture disasters the very moment they struck - a waiter suffering a hands-full mishap, for example, and a cyclist crashing into a lamp post.

Here, MailOnline Travel has rounded up some of the funniest photobombs ever to have taken place from around the world.
