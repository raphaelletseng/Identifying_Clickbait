As you head to the gym, set an intention for your workout. For example, “My intention is to take care of my body. I will accomplish this with 20 minutes of cardio and strength training.”

At the gym, take note of your energy level and your mood before you begin.

As you begin to work out, notice the changes in your breath, feel your heart rate increase, and take note of any perspiration. Practice being nonjudgmental about what you observe.

Every day is a new day. Celebrate your accomplishments and, on occasion, give yourself permission to take a break and begin again.

When you’ve completed your workout, notice any shifts in your energy and mood.

Be grateful for your body’s ability to move and change.
