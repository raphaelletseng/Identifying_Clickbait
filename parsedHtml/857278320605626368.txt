We're closing in on the first 100 days of the Trump presidency, even though it's felt more like 100 years since the inauguration.

Pundits are now trying to gauge where the president falls on the success scale, from "SAD!" to "BIGLY!," for this somewhat important but still kinda arbitrary milestone.

But Twitter users have another talent: using these types of events to unleash some pithy burns. And #TrumpsDay100Songs—song lyrics and titles twisted for a more Trumpian feel—don't disappoint.

Don't know much about history

know a lot about bigotry

Don't know much about any book

know a lot about being a crook — Dan Deasy (@DanDeasy) April 25, 2017

Every tweet you make

Every law you break

Every tan you fake

Every golf trip you take

We'll be watching you#TrumpsDay100Songs — Janae (@janae_saisquoi) April 25, 2017

Trump's official 100th Day in office is this Saturday, April 29, handily coinciding with a new crisis: a potential government shutdown on the horizon.

There's still plenty of time to get your cracks in on Trump ... though can anything really top Donald Trump singing the Green Acres theme song?
