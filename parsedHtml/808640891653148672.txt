Most of the world doesnât actually see America the way Trump said it did
President Obama spent much of his last year in office rejecting a dystopian view of America painted by Republicans. Embedded in Donald Trump’s promise to make America great again was a dark portrayal of how the rest of the world now sees the United States: vulnerable, weak and disrespected. But surveys of global opinion show no major fall-off in perceptions of American power over the past seven years. Indeed, the data points to a dramatic upward shift in America’s reputation during the Obama years. America’s global popularity rises under Obama presidency Favorable views of the United States rose from a median of 51 percent in George W.

Source: Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Project CHRIS ALCANTARA/THE WASHINGTON POST It’s hard now to remember just how much antagonism the United States faced across the globe in 2008: People in other countries blamed America for the Iraq war, which undermined support for the war on terrorism. They focused on prisoner treatment at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and talked about America’s negative impact on their own countries. In the final year of George W. Bush’s presidency, his abysmal approval ratings at home were matched by the opinions of those abroad. As a candidate, Obama’s promise was to change all that. Almost eight years on, global opinion surveys suggest that, to some degree, he has. When the Pew Research Center conducted surveys across 30 countries during Bush’s final two years in office, an average of less than 3 in 10 people expressed confidence in Bush. Months later, during Obama’s first year in office, more than 6 in 10 expressed such confidence. That initial surge of approval has barely dipped in the years since — with an average of 61 percent rating Obama positively during the last two years of his presidency in the same countries polled by Pew toward the end of Bush’s term. But Obama’s popularity and shifts in rhetoric and policy appear to have pulled up global opinion of the United States as a whole. In 2015 and 2016, an average 60 percent of people throughout the world surveyed by Pew had a favorable opinion of the United States, compared with 49 percent in Bush’s final two years in office. The change in opinion has been sharpest in Western Europe. And Germany in particular shows how dramatic that shift has been. From 2000 to 2008, the share of Germans who viewed the United States favorably fell by more than half, from 78 to 31 percent. Roughly 7 in 10 Germans wanted the United States to remove troops from Iraq in 2007, and in Bush’s final year only 14 percent said they had confidence in his leadership. Asked to describe this period, Germany’s current ambassador to the United States, Peter Wittig, was tactful. “There are many positive things people in Germany associate with Americans,” he said. “But in the era of W. Bush, it was mostly, how can I say, overshadowed by the Iraq war.” In the lead-up to the war, hundreds of thousands took to the streets to protest in Berlin and other cities. “Blood for Oil,” screamed the cover of Germany’s influential Der Spiegel magazine. Twice, lawyers filed suits in German courts, trying to prosecute then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on war crimes. Even the new American embassy opening in Berlin in 2008 became an opportunity for anti-American bashing, with one German paper calling the upper floors of the embassy the “wellness and waterboarding Area.” Opinions plummeted in other Western countries. In Britain, favorable ratings of the United States fell from 83 to 53 percent from 2000 to 2008. Similar drops were seen in Spain, France, Poland, Turkey, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico and Argentina. By the end of Bush’s presidency, the only places left where a majority said they had confidence in how U.S. leaders handled global affairs were Israel and seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It was against that backdrop that Obama arrived in Berlin in 2008, in the middle of the presidential campaign; he was a rock star. An estimated 200,000 people packed into the Tiergarten park in July 2008 for his speech near the base of Berlin’s iconic Victory Column. He promised that if elected president he would put an end to the American unilateralism and cowboy diplomacy that had so incensed Europe. “In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our world . . . has become all too common,” Obama said. “No one nation, no matter how large or powerful, can defeat such challenges alone.” Trying to explain the emotional reaction of his countrymen back then, Wittig said Obama tapped into something deep in the German psyche. “You might call it naïve or idealistic,” he said. “But it appealed to their hidden love of America . . . the idea that America could be a force for good.” “The fact that America could elect an Afro-American. It made America seem avant-garde again. It showed the tremendous strength Americans have,” he said. In Obama’s first year, Pew found 93 percent of Germans saying they had confidence in his leadership, according to Pew, a number that has slipped slightly, to 86 percent this year. That success has not been universal. Obama has barely made a dent, for example, in how the Muslim world views the United States, and opinions in some of those countries have even worsened. In Pakistan, for example, 62 percent held an unfavorable view of the United States last year, almost identical to the 63 percent in 2008. And 56 percent said they have little or no confidence in Obama’s leadership in world affairs, slightly below how they rated Bush in his final year. Obama’s use of drone strikes as an anti-terrorism weapon has been widely unpopular. The last Pew poll available from Egypt in 2014 showed the United States had become even more despised there than during the Bush years. Only 10 percent had a favorable view of the United States in 2013, lower than the 27 percent in 2009 right after Obama took office, and lower than the 22 percent in 2008, Bush’s final year. Much of the debate in the 2016 presidential campaign focused on America’s standing in the world, with some candidates and voters expressing worry that the nation’s global power had declined. Most of the rest of the world perceived no such fall-off. When a 2016 Pew survey of 15 countries asked whether America’s importance and power has changed in the past decade, a median 41 percent said the United States is similarly powerful as before, while 33 percent said it is less powerful and 20 percent saw it as more powerful. When it comes to China, global opinion reflects China’s rising influence. A median of 43 percent said the United States is still now the world’s leading economic power, while 35 percent said China is. With the United States economy’s gradual recovery and China’s growth rates slowing, the percentage naming the United States as the world’s top economy has risen. Barack Obama’s watershed 2008 election and the presidency that followed profoundly altered the aesthetics of American democracy, transforming the Founding Fathers’ narrow vision of politics and citizenship into something more expansive and more elegant. The American presidency suddenly looked very different, and for a moment America felt different, too. The Obama victory helped fulfill one of the great ambitions of the civil rights struggle by showcasing the ability of extraordinarily talented black Americans to lead and excel in all facets of American life. First lady Michelle Obama, and daughters Sasha and Malia, extended this reimagining of black American life by providing a conspicuous vision of a healthy, loving and thriving African American family that defies still-prevalent racist stereotypes. But some interpreted Obama’s triumph as much more. The victory was heralded as the arrival of a “post-racial” America, one in which the nation’s original sin of racial slavery and post-Reconstruction Jim Crow discrimination had finally been absolved by the election of a black man as commander in chief. For a while, the nation basked in a racially harmonious afterglow. A black president would influence generations of young children to embrace a new vision of American citizenship. The “Obama Coalition” of African American, white, Latino, Asian American and Native American voters had helped usher in an era in which institutional racism and pervasive inequality would fade as Americans embraced the nation’s multicultural promise. Seven years later, such profound optimism seems misplaced. Almost immediately, the Obama presidency unleashed racial furies that have only multiplied over time. From the tea party’s racially tinged attacks on the president’s policy agenda to the “birther” movement’s more overtly racist fantasies asserting that Obama was not even an American citizen, the national racial climate grew more, and not less, fraught. If racial conflict, in the form of birthers, tea partyers and gnawing resentments, implicitly shadowed Obama’s first term, it erupted into open warfare during much of his second. The Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in the case gutted Voting Rights Act enforcement, throwing into question the signal achievement of the civil rights movement’s heroic period. Beginning with the 2012 shooting death of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida, the nation reopened an intense debate on the continued horror of institutional racism evidenced by a string of high-profile deaths of black men, women, boys and girls at the hands of law enforcement. The organized demonstrations, protests and outrage of a new generation of civil rights activists turned the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter into the clarion call for a new social justice movement. Black Lives Matter activists have forcefully argued that the U.S. criminal justice system represents a gateway to racial oppression, one marked by a drug war that disproportionately targets, punishes and warehouses young men and women of color. In her bestselling book “ The New Jim Crow ,” legal scholar Michelle Alexander argued that mass incarceration represents a racial caste system that echoes the pervasive, structural inequality of a system of racial apartheid that persists. Obama’s first-term caution on race matters was punctured by his controversial remarks that police “acted stupidly” in the mistaken identity arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., Harvard University’s prominent African American studies professor, in 2009. Four years later he entered the breach once more by proclaiming that if he had a son, “he’d look like Trayvon.” In the aftermath of racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, and a racially motivated massacre in Charleston, S.C., Obama went further. In 2015, Obama found his voice in a series of stirring speeches in Selma, Ala., and Charleston, where he acknowledged America’s long and continuous history of racial injustice. Policy-wise Obama has launched a private philanthropic effort, My Brother’s Keeper, designed to assist low-income black boys, and became the first president to visit a federal prison in a call for prison reform that foreshadowed the administration’s efforts to release federal inmates facing long sentences on relatively minor drug charges. Despite these efforts, many of Obama’s African American supporters have expressed profound disappointment over the president’s refusal to forcefully pursue racial and economic justice policies for his most loyal political constituency. From this perspective, the Obama presidency has played out as a cruel joke on members of the African American community who, despite providing indispensable votes, critical support and unstinting loyalty, find themselves largely shut out from the nation’s post-Great Recession economic recovery. Blacks have, critics suggested, traded away substantive policy demands for the largely symbolic psychological and emotional victory of having a black president and first family in the White House for eight years. Others find that assessment harsh, noting that Obama’s most impressive policy achievements have received scant promotion from the White House or acknowledgment in the mainstream media. History will decide the full measure of the importance, success, failures and shortcomings of the Obama presidency. With regard to race, Obama’s historical significance is ensured; only his impact and legacy are up for debate. In retrospect, the burden of transforming America’s tortured racial history in two four-year presidential terms proved impossible, even as its promise helped to catapult Obama to the nation’s highest office. Obama’s presidency elides important aspects of the civil rights struggle, especially the teachings of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. King, for a time, served as the racial justice consciousness for two presidents — John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Many who hoped Obama might be able to serve both roles — as president and racial justice advocate — have been disappointed. Yet there is a revelatory clarity in that disappointment, proving that Obama is not King or Frederick Douglass, but Abraham Lincoln, Kennedy and Johnson. Even a black president, perhaps especially a black president, could not untangle racism’s Gordian knot on the body politic. Yet in acknowledging the limitations of Obama’s presidency on healing racial divisions and the shortcomings of his policies in uplifting black America, we may reach a newfound political maturity that recognizes that no one person — no matter how powerful — can single-handedly rectify structures of inequality constructed over centuries.

President Obama spent much of his last year in office rejecting a dystopian view of America painted by Republicans. Embedded in Donald Trump’s promise to make America great again was a dark portrayal of how the rest of the world now sees the United States: vulnerable, weak and disrespected.

In Obama’s first year, Pew found 93 percent of Germans saying they had confidence in his leadership, according to Pew, a number that has slipped slightly, to 86 percent this year.

Views in the Muslim world

That success has not been universal.

Obama has barely made a dent, for example, in how the Muslim world views the United States, and opinions in some of those countries have even worsened.

In Pakistan, for example, 62 percent held an unfavorable view of the United States last year, almost identical to the 63 percent in 2008.

When it comes to China, global opinion reflects China’s rising influence. A median of 43 percent said the United States is still now the world’s leading economic power, while 35 percent said China is. With the United States economy’s gradual recovery and China’s growth rates slowing, the percentage naming the United States as the world’s top economy has risen.
