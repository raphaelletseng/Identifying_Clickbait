Kristen Stewart Said "I'm So Gay, Dude," On "SNL" And People Are Freaking Out
This is Kristen Stewart. She’s an actress who has been fairly open about the fact that she’s queer AF. Back in September she confirmed she was dating Alicia Cargile, a film producer.  View on Instagram She opened up about the experience of dating a girl in an interview with Elle , saying, “I’m just really in love with my girlfriend.” And now she is rumored to be dating Victoria’s Secret model Stella Maxwell.  View on Instagram But she has never actually said the word “gay”… until now. Last night Kristen hosted , and said in her monologue, “The president is not a huge fan of me. But that is so OK! And Donald, if you didn’t like me , you’re really probably not going to like me , because I’m hosting , and I’m, like, so gay, dude.” Can we see that again in slow motion? I would like to thank God and also Jesus for this gift. Obviously, Kristen doesn’t owe us “coming out” and sexuality labels are fluid, etc. etc. But… we almost never get to hear the “g” word. So you can’t blame us for celebrating. #KristenStewart JUST SAID SHE'S SO GAY, DUDE TO the president and I'm dead. God bless Kristen Stewart.
