Netflix has added a function that'll come as a relief to those who dislike sitting through the opening credits of the TV show they're bingeing over and over again.

While it's yet to be made available across all media platforms, most users have reportedly seen the function while accessing Netflix on their computer.

Smita Saran, a spokesperson for Netflix, revealed that the function is one of “hundreds” of A-B tests that it conducts each year.

The TV shows viewers will be able to skip the credits of includes House of Cards and Marvel's latest series Iron Fist (which is receiving some pretty damning first-look reviews).
