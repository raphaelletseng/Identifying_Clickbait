The White House had a curious explanation for Trump describing deportations as a 'military operation'


White House press secretaryÂ Sean Spicer attempted to clarify an ominous phrase used by President Donald Trump on ThursdayÂ â but his answer left peopleÂ scratching their heads instead.

Earlier on Thursday, Trump described his efforts to remove unauthorized immigrants from the US as "a military operation," a phrase thatÂ seemed to contradict efforts fromÂ White House officials who said the military would not be involved with the deportation plans.

When asked what Trump meant, Spicer saidÂ Trump was using the word "military" as an adjective, adding that Trump meantÂ his orders would be carried out "in a very streamlined and efficient manner."

"The president was using that as an adjective. It's happening with precision and in a mannerÂ in which it's being done very, very clearly," Spicer said.

"And so justÂ to be clear on his use of that phrase," he added, "and IÂ think the way it's being done by all accounts is being done with very much aÂ high degree of precision, and in a flawless manner."

According to Merriam-Webster, look-ups for the word "military" spiked immediately following Spicer's comments. However, Spicer's takeÂ seems to put him at odds with the dictionary, in whichÂ the adjective "military" means "relating to soldiers, arms, or war."Â

Belying Spicer's comment is data from the Corpus of Contemporary American English, which has 450 million words spoken on television and written in books and print media over the past three decades. Out of the hundreds of documented uses of the termÂ "military operation," none of them seem to specifically suggest a level of precision.

TrumpÂ may have been aiming for the phraseÂ "military precision," linguistÂ Ben Zimmer told Business Insider, but that wouldn't necessarily excuse him, either.Â

"Trump could have said, 'It's an operation carried out with military precision,' and that would have been understood as conveying the type of precision associated with the military," Zimmer saidÂ in an email. "But saying 'it's a military operation' does not convey that at all."

Spicer also could have also meant to conjure a different word altogether, New York Times columnistÂ Brendan Nyhan and Cornell law professor Josh Chafetz said on Twitter.

Pssssst! Spicer! The word you're looking for is "metaphor." â Josh Chafetz (@joshchafetz) February 23, 2017

Without further clarification,Â it's impossible to tell exactlyÂ what Trump meant with his "military operation" comment. In language, like with any successful military operation, it helps to be precise.
