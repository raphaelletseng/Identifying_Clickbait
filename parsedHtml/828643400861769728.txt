Designers create Ikea instructions for Trump's $20 billion border wall


Assembling an Ikea bookshelf may beÂ difficult,Â butÂ designers from the satirical site The PastillonÂ have envisioned Ikea instructionsÂ for a project that looks trulyÂ back-breaking: Trump's border wall.

They created aÂ tongue-in-cheek ad for aÂ "BÃ¶rder WÃ¥ll," making fun of Trump's real-life proposal.

Less than a week after Inauguration Day, Trump reiterated his plans on Twitter toÂ build a 1,900-milelong wall along the US-Mexico border. Construction could cost American taxpayers an estimatedÂ $15 billion to $25 billion, though Trump says Mexico would eventually pay for the wall through taxes or trade. Maintenance and hiring 21,000 border-patrol agents could cost an additional $2.1 billion a year, according to CNBC and an analysis by Politico.Â

From that perspective, the designers are offering their fake flat-pack wall for a bargain:Â $9,999,999,999.99. Inside, the presumably very large box would includeÂ 471,612 boards, 313,329 rounds of barbed wire, 5,659,344Â screws,Â and a single allen wrench.

Next to the picture of the assembly materials, there's a person facing the wall with a confused look on its face. Building theÂ BÃ¶rder WÃ¥llÂ seems like would be more than a one-person job.
