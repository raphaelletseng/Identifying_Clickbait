New Obama/Biden memes are here to help you survive inauguration week

SEE ALSO: Watch the entire, tearful bromance tribute between Obama and Biden With less than a week until Trump's inauguration, we could all use a good laugh right now.

You can take Barack and Joe out of the White House, but you can never take Barack and Joe out of the memes.

Over the past eight years, President Obama and VP Biden have formed a lasting bromance, and with every great bromance comes some beautifully creative memes.

Having been inspired by the first round of beloved "Biden plotting against Trump" memes, the fine folks on the internet are back at it again, and have decided to transform the touching moment when Obama presented Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom into a joke sesh.

With less than a week until Trump's inauguration, we could all use a good laugh right now. After all, who knows when we'll have another Obama/Biden meme opportunity?

So you just sit back, relax and watch the internet reimagine how the POTUS and VP's most bro-mantic moment really went down.
