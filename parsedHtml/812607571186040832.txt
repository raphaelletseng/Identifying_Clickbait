At a bank in Norway there is a 'Christmas pig' made of marzipan in a bank, and it has been immortalised while defecating (also marzipan).

In Kristiansand, artists Erik Pirolt and Stian Pollestad was asked by a downtown bank to create something to draw customers to their downtown lobby branch.

Pirolt told the Local:
