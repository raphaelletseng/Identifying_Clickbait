2017 NFL Free Agents: Best Players Available at Every Position Post Day 2
2017 NFL Free Agents: Best Players Available at Every Position Post Day 2
2017 NFL Free Agents: Best Players Available at Every Position Post Day 2 The NFL was dealing with an epic hangover Friday. It hardly remembers what it did on Thursday, but the shenanigans that unfolded on the first official day of free agency caused the league to sleep through its alarm clock. And when it finally showed up to work, an upset stomach and a pounding headache made it difficult to get things done. That explains why Friday was so much quieter on the free-agent market. Professional football needed a day to recover. But the good news is that means a slew of top-notch players who fell through the cracks on Thursday remain available as we enter the weekend. Here's a rundown. Quarterback : The 33-year-old is technically a one-time Pro Bowler, but that was back in 2008. He's won just a single playoff game in his 11-year career. That being said, he still might be one of the top 32 quarterbacks in a 32-team league. : Smith is one of the most underrated free agents on the market. The 2013 second-round pick really appeared to be putting it together late in 2014, but bad luck and injuries have prevented him from getting a real shot ever since. He's only 26, though, and we still don't know where his ceiling is. : Kaep's hot run in 2012 and 2013 was a mirage. He's been horrendous ever since. Dude turns 30 this year, and he's got a sub-60 career completion percentage. He'll get a job this summer only because of his athleticism. : The league's lowest-rated qualified passer from 2016 is 34 years old. He's probably done. : He had more interceptions than touchdowns in nine starts as a 29-year-old last season, but he should have a chance to compete for a backup job somewhere. : For all intents and purposes, McCown is a career backup. Considering he turns 38 this summer, he's probably toast. : The 2009 No. 5 overall pick had some moments early in his career, and we know he's mighty talented. Still, at the age of 30 he's a No. 2 at best. : Ryan Nassib, Shaun Hill, Matt McGloin, E.J. Manuel, Blaine Gabbert, T.J. Yates, Kellen Moore, Josh Johnson, Kellen Clemens, Dan Orlovsky, Thad Lewis Running Back : It's not a great sign that Murray's workload decreased in his third full season with the Raiders. After averaging 5.2 yards per attempt as a rookie, the 27-year-old has averaged just 4.0 the last two years. He still scored 12 touchdowns last season, but Murray is probably best suited for a platoon. : In Peterson's last nine starts, he's averaging only 2.9 yards per carry. He failed to reach the 70-yard mark on the ground in eight of those nine games and hasn't scored a touchdown in his last four outings. Throw concerns regarding his age (he turns 32 this month), durability (he missed most of 2016 due to a knee injury) and character (he missed virtually the entire 2014 season while on the commissioner’s exempt list after being indicted on child-abuse charges) and I'm not sure he finds a job very easily. : How much does he have left? Charles is an electric four-time Pro Bowler, but he's carried the ball just 83 times in two years and he turned 30 in December. : The former No. 4 overall pick averaged 4.6 yards per carry and went over the 1,000-yard mark in 2015, and he might have a little more gas in his tank than a typical 29-year-old back. : Some might be intrigued by the fact he averaged 5.5 yards per carry as a rookie in 2013, but he's 28 now and he's averaged just 3.3 yards a pop ever since. We'll see if someone gives him a shot based on that and his versatility. : Rashad Jennings, Chris Johnson, Tim Hightower, Reggie Bush, Denard Robinson, James Starks, Matt Asiata, DeAngelo Williams, Joique Bell, Brandon Bolden, Dexter McCluster, Ronnie Hillman, Travaris Cadet, Justin Forsett, Christine Michael, Khiry Robinson, Karlos Williams Wide Receiver : We'll see if off-the-field concerns limit his market, but somebody will give a shot to a talented 27-year-old with three 800-yard campaigns under his belt. : The 2012 first-round pick went over 1,000 yards in 2013 but hasn't been the same since. Still, he's only 27 and he certainly has the ability to excel in the right environment. : Few probably realize that the 27-year-old had 944 receiving yards in 2015. He can be a real strong No. 3 receiver. : Patterson might never become the receiver many had hoped he would, but the 2013 first-round pick is a two-time All-Pro return man coming off a half-decent season on offense. And he's only 25. : Happy birthday, Andrew! Unfortunately, 31-year-old speed guys aren't highly valued in this league. It's beginning to look as though Hawkins' 824-yard 2014 campaign was an anomaly. : The 27-year-old might find more success outside of Rams-land, but he's probably still a No. 3 receiver at best. : He's a six-time 1,000-yard receiver, but he's 34 and he's been MIA for much of the last two years. : Andre Holmes, Stevie Johnson, Russell Shepard, Justin Hunter, Quinton Patton, Corey Brown, Deonte Thompson, Devin Hester Tight End/Fullback/H-Back : The four-time 500-yard tight end might have made himself a lot of money down the stretch with the Packers in 2016. He'll turn 30 this year. : The 27-year-old has started 30 games the last four years. And although he played small role in 2016, he caught 71.4 percent of the passes thrown his way. I think he can compete for a starting job somewhere. : He also had a strong 2014 season (58 catches, 534 yards, four touchdowns) but the 26-year-old's numbers have plummeted since. : Gavin Escobar, Jacob Tamme, MarQueis Gray, Clay Harbor, Ryan Griffin, Lance Kendricks  : The nine-year veteran led the way for the best ground game in the league in 2016, but it's apparent he won't be back in Buffalo. : The 31-year-old did a good job after being signed late in the year by Seattle. : Zach Line, Will Tukuafu Offensive Tackle : The two-time All-Pro hasn't been reliable since 2014 and hasn't stood out since 2012. At 30, he might be nearly done. But I'm still expecting somebody to take a flier. : Between 2011 and 2013, Smith was one of the best right tackles in football. Ever since, he's either been hurt or ineffective. The 2009 No. 6 overall pick is on the wrong side of 30, so we'll see if he gets another shot. : The 28-year-old has started 56 games in six NFL seasons with the Packers, Bengals and Giants. He hasn't performed well very often in those games, but I wouldn't be surprised if somebody tried to move him inside. : Despite often battling injuries, Vollmer was often damn good as New England's right tackle between 2010 and 2015. But he missed the entire 2016 season, is about to turn 33 and might retire . : : Bradley Sowell, Jake Long, Breno Giacomini, Gosder Cherilus, Byron Bell Guard : The guard market is disappearing, but the 29-year-old Lang has been a solid starter for six years and is coming off a Pro Bowl campaign. If he's healthy, he'll get paid. : He did a decent job as Cleveland's regular right tackle last season, but somebody will probably pay the 26-year-old to move inside. : The 2013 undrafted free agent earned strong PFF grades as the Saints' regular left guard in 2015 before receiving less snaps in 2016. But he can play anywhere along the line and is still just 27. : The 32-year-old started all 16 games at right guard for the Dolphins in 2016, but he was graded by PFF as the second-worst qualified guard in football. He could be done. : The veteran right guard has started 16 games in four of the last five years. But he's 30 and coming off a mediocre season with the Giants. : Chester is 34 and coming off a rough year, but he hasn't missed a start since 2010. : Fusco has been one of the league's worst starting guards each of the last two years, indicating the 28-year-old's strong 2013 campaign may have been a fluke. : Jahri Evans, Patrick Omameh, Andrew Garner, Mike Harris Center : The seven-time Pro Bowler is 33 and is coming off a rough season that was derailed by a nagging ankle injury, but I wouldn't be surprised if he excelled for another year or two in the right environment. : The 28-year-old hasn't fared well in the eyes of PFF , but he's got the intangibles you want in a veteran at that position. : Still only 25, he started 28 games for the Titans the last four years. There's no room for him there, but he'd bring some depth and potential to an interior line in need. : PFF : John Sullivan, Cody Wallace, Michael Person Defensive End : He might never replicate his 14.5-sack 2014 season, but the 30-year-old still hasn't missed a start since 2010. He's a reliable starter, which isn't easy to find. : When healthy, he's flashed. The 28-year-old was superb against defending the run in limited action last year in San Diego. : I know he's 37, but the seven-time Pro Bowler was actually great in a situational role with the Falcons down the stretch last year. And don't forget that he was probably the best pass-rusher on the Arizona roster in 2015. If he decides to keep playing, he'll get paid. : After fading for a couple years, the 2008 No. 2 overall pick had one of those typical reclamation seasons with New England in 2016, posting four sacks and a positive PFF grade in limited action. He should leverage that into a Freeney-like role somewhere. : The 27-year-old has quietly recorded 11.5 sacks the last two years in Detroit. : The 26-year-old is a versatile lineman who can shut down the run and rush the passer. He deserves a bigger role than the one he's played in Baltimore the last couple years. : Ziggy Hood, Vance Walker, Darryl Tapp, Antonio Smith, Cullen Jenkins, Mario Williams, C.J. Wilson, Jarvis Jenkins, Jason Jones, Margus Hunt, Kendall Reyes, Wallace Gilberry, Damontre Moore Defensive Tackle : Poe is coming off his worst season since his rookie campaign in 2012, but he’s only 26 and has earned two Pro Bowl nods. Somebody will gladly pay for that big, nimble body. : A regular starter for much of the last four years in Philadelphia, the 27-year-old former third-round pick was graded by PFF as the 11th-best run-stopping defensive tackle in the league in 2015. : Recently released by the Jaguars, the 30-year-old has 61 career starts under his belt. Like Hankins, he was also at his best in 2014 but hasn't done much outside of that 8.5-sack campaign. : The 2010 first-round pick has experienced an up-and-down career, which isn't promising considering he's 30 and coming off a season derailed by an elbow injury. : The 28-year-old can bring heat inside but isn't a consistent or steady run stopper. : The 2010 first-round pick has been a disappointment as he approaches his 30th birthday, but he still has the ability to contribute as a half-decent rotational guy up front. : Al Woods, Corbin Bryant, Leger Douzable, Stefan Charles, Tyrunn Walker, Glenn Dorsey, Domata Peko, Paul Soliai, Devon Still, Jordan Hill, John Jenkins Inside Linebacker : The five-year veteran is only 26 and coming off a Pro Bowl season. He also played a starring role in Super Bowl LI, which is certainly worth something. Rather surprised the Patriots didn't tag him, and that he remains available. : The 2013 second-round pick is coming off a breakout season. He's not a star, but he hasn't missed a start the last two years and he's steadily improving. Plus, he's only 26. : The reliable 28-year-old is coming off the best seven of his seven-year career, but he hasn't started all 16 games since he was in Washington in 2013. : How much does the 2014 Pro Bowler have left in the tank at the age of 33? He was on pace to register 100 tackles last season before a suspension got in the way. : The former second-round pick probably shouldn't be viewed as an every-down player anymore, but he's got the talent to play a relatively key role. : Keenan Robinson, Justin Durant, Akeem Dent, Sean Spence, Outside Linebacker : Ware's numbers have dropped in back-to-back seasons and he'll be 35 before he plays another snap, but he's still DeMarcus freakin' Ware, and he can still excel in a situational role. : The 10-year vet had a 12.5-sack season out of nowhere with Buffalo in 2016. Was it a fluke? He’ll be 34 this spring, but somebody is bound to gamble that Alexander a late-bloomer with another Pro Bowl campaign in him. : The 2009 third-round pick was one of the best all-around linebackers in the game in 2013 and 2014 but he hasn't been able to stay healthy since. He'll come at a discounted price as a result. : Recently released by the Ravens, the five-time Pro Bowler is only two years removed from a 17-sack season. But he hasn't done much the last couple years and was limited due to injuries in 2016. What does he have left? : The 2013 first-round pick hasn't lived up to expectations, starting just seven games in four years with the Packers. Will somebody pay him for his talent, ignoring his NFL resume? : He just turned 26 and is two years removed from an eight-sack season. He hasn't taken down the quarterback as much the last two seasons and his role shrunk in 2016, but his PFF pass-rushing grades have actually climbed. : Jenkins had 133 solo tackles in 27 starts in 2014 and 2015, but everything kind of fell apart in a rough 2016 campaign. Still, he's only 24. : Paul Kruger, Erik Walden, Sam Acho, Armonty Bryant, Spencer Paysinger, Michael Morgan Cornerback : The 2012 No. 6 overall pick hasn't been healthy enough. And when he's been healthy he hasn't been effective enough (just four interceptions in five years). Still, he's coming off his highest-rated season at PFF and a new home could give him a chance to break out. : Another nickel guy, Robey-Coleman gave up an opposing passer rating of just 74.9 when covering receivers in the slot in 2016, according to PFF .  He's only 25, too. : Carr might not be consistently reliable, but he hasn't missed a start in his nine-year career and he's still only 30. He won't get big money like a did a few years ago, but somebody will be tempted to pay up and use him in a modified role. : Flowers has made just 16 starts the last two years and hasn't suited up for a complete season since he was in Kansas City in 2011. Still, he only just turned 31 and he has a Pro Bowl on his resume. : The 30-year-old doesn't stand out, but he's opportunistic and experienced enough to be a solid No. 3 corner. : Patrick Robinson, Darrelle Revis, Marcus Cooper, Terence Newman, Leon Hall, Valentino Blake, Leodis McKelvin, Leonard Johnson, Kayvon Webster, Jerraud Powers, Sam Shields, Coty Sensabaugh, Greg Toler Safety : The 26-year-old had two interceptions and 79 tackles while also earning a positive PFF grade against the run in 16 starts with the Bucs in 2016. : The 26-year-old had two picks and 49 tackles in 16 starts with the Rams in 2016, holding opposing quarterbacks to a 68.8 passer rating in coverage, per PFF . : Wilcox hasn't been able to recapture the magic that helped him record three picks and 69 tackles in a 16-start 2014 campaign, but he's only 26 and he actually posted the highest PFF grade of his career last year. : Recently released by the Dolphins, the 27-year-old is coming off a 15-start, two-pick, 49-tackle campaign. Problem is that release came after he failed a physical stemming from neck issues he developed late in the year. : He made the Pro Bowl three times in five years with the Bills, but Byrd is 30 now and coming off of three disappointing seasons in New Orleans. Someone will give him a shot with that resume. : Recently released by the Ravens, Webb is a former corner who might be running out of options at the age of 31. He's still young for a safety, though, so we maybe somebody will take a flier. : After serving as a starting free safety in three different cities in a three-year span, Lewis stuck with the Ravens for a second consecutive season in 2016 but missed virtually the entire year with a thigh injury. He's still only 28, so he has a chance to get his career back on track. And he should come cheap. : Corey Graham, Rashad Johnson, Duke Ihenacho, Robert Blanton Dashon Goldson, Michael Thomas, Daimion Stafford, Roman Harper, Specialists : "Legatron" has actually missed eight of his last 13 field goal attempts from beyond 50 yards. The 29-year-old will still get a shot somewhere, though. : The 10-year veteran hasn't missed a beat in recent years. He's 32. : The 31-year-old was a putrid 5-for-11 from 40-plus yards in 2016. Throw in that he has lost the ability to make extra points under the new rules and he'll have trouble finding work. : Zach Hocker, Randy Bullock Like the new article format? Send us feedback !

1. Eddie Lacy: If Lacy's in good shape, the 2013 Offensive Rookie of the Year can be a major weapon. He's still only 26, and he was averaging 5.1 yards per carry early in 2016 before a foot injury ended his season.

2. Rex Burkhead: In Week 17, after toiling in football anonymity for most of his first four seasons in Cincinnati, Burkhead gained 144 yards from scrimmage on 29 touches and scored twice against Baltimore's highly rated defense in his first career start. One great game probably isn't enough to convince anyone that a fifth-year former sixth-round pick out of Nebraska is ready to become an elite, every-down back, but Burkhead quietly averaged a solid 4.6 yards per carry on 74 attempts in 2016. And he has plenty of tread on his tires.

3. Latavius Murray: It's not a great sign that Murray's workload decreased in his third full season with the Raiders. After averaging 5.2 yards per attempt as a rookie, the 27-year-old has averaged just 4.0 the last two years. He still scored 12 touchdowns last season, but Murray is probably best suited for a platoon.

4. LeGarrette Blount: He's got the ability and the experience and he's coming off an 1,161-yard, 18-touchdown season. But that was in New England, and Blount is now on the wrong side of 30.

5. Adrian Peterson: In Peterson's last nine starts, he's averaging only 2.9 yards per carry. He failed to reach the 70-yard mark on the ground in eight of those nine games and hasn't scored a touchdown in his last four outings. Throw concerns regarding his age (he turns 32 this month), durability (he missed most of 2016 due to a knee injury) and character (he missed virtually the entire 2014 season while on the commissioner’s exempt list after being indicted on child-abuse charges) and I'm not sure he finds a job very easily.

6. Jamaal Charles: How much does he have left? Charles is an electric four-time Pro Bowler, but he's carried the ball just 83 times in two years and he turned 30 in December.

7. Darren McFadden: The former No. 4 overall pick averaged 4.6 yards per carry and went over the 1,000-yard mark in 2015, and he might have a little more gas in his tank than a typical 29-year-old back.

8. Andre Ellington: Some might be intrigued by the fact he averaged 5.5 yards per carry as a rookie in 2013, but he's 28 now and he's averaged just 3.3 yards a pop ever since. We'll see if someone gives him a shot based on that and his versatility.

Best of the Rest: Rashad Jennings, Chris Johnson, Tim Hightower, Reggie Bush, Denard Robinson, James Starks, Matt Asiata, DeAngelo Williams, Joique Bell, Brandon Bolden, Dexter McCluster, Ronnie Hillman, Travaris Cadet, Justin Forsett, Christine Michael, Khiry Robinson, Karlos Williams
