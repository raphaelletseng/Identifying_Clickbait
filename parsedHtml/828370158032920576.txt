The Buffalo variety, by most accounts “invented” at the Anchor Bar in, yes, Buffalo, is the official food of our most sacred event of the year: the Super Bowl. These can be made on the grill or in the oven.   The Key To A Truly Great Chicken Wing .     Barbecue , Chicken Wing , Hot Sauce  Ingredients                     Nutritional analysis per serving (4 servings)    Preparation Cut 3 pounds of chicken wings into 3 sections; save the wing tips for stock. Toss the wings with a little neutral oil to keep them from sticking. Heat a charcoal or gas grill; the fire should be moderately hot and the rack 4 to 6 inches from the heat. Leave one side of the grill cooler for indirect cooking. Put the wings on the cool side of the grill. Cover the grill and cook, checking and turning once or twice, until most of the fat has been rendered and the wings are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. (You can also broil in the oven on a sheet pan, flipping wings halfway through.) While the wings cook, combine 1/3 cup relatively mild hot sauce, 4 tablespoons melted butter, 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or white vinegar, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, salt and pepper in a large bowl. When the wings are cooked, add them to the bowl with the sauce, and toss to coat. Now put the wings on the hot part of the grill and cook, uncovered, turning as necessary, until they’re nicely browned on both sides. (Or return to the broiler for a few minutes.)
