A replica of the Nobel medal awarded to Indian child rights campaigner Kailash Satyarthi has been stolen from his home in the capital, Delhi.

Mr Satyarthi told the BBC that his Nobel certificate was also missing after the burglary on Tuesday morning.

He said no-one was home at the time of the burglary.

Mr Satyarthi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for his work to combat child labour and child trafficking in India.

He shared the award with Pakistani child education activist Malala Yousafzai for her work on female education.
