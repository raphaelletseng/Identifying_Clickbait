Today's robotsÂ are pretty extraordinary. They can paint incredible worksÂ of art, run lettuce farms, and evenÂ act like humans (sort of).

One Silicon ValleyÂ startup called BeeHexÂ Â has even invented a bot that can 3D-print pizza.

The inventors received a $125,000 grant from NASA to develop the device in 2016, cofounder Jordan French told Business Insider at the time. NASA was looking for a bot that could easily make something delicious (as opposed to normal, unappetizing space food) for astronauts during future Mars missions.

The startup has since shifted to adapting the prototype for the commercial market. In February, TechCrunch reported that itÂ raised $1 million in seed funding to launch its first product, a pizza printer called the Chef 3D.

Starting later this year, the Chef 3D will appear at select theme parks, sports arenas, and malls. Compared to human workers, the robot is faster, cleaner, and more consistent, French says. Only one person is needed to work the machine, which can lay down the dough, sauce, and cheese for a 12-inch pizza in one minute, before you pop it in an oven for five.Â
