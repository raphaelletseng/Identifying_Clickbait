26 Pictures That Will Ruin Your Weekend
This is not what I expected when I ordered a Caesar salad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               There's a tile conspiracy.                                   Whose twisted grandmother did this?                                                                                                       The humanity.    Honestly why do I bother attempting this shit    Sausage, chips and... other stuff... at Varsity, Warwick. 

Yes, that is a dog bowl.
