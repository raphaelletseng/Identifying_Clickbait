Wright State's Steven Davis Throws Down Poster Dunk All Over Urbana Defender
Wright State's Steven Davis with his submission for dunk of the year!! pic.twitter.com/mBT5Ct3iKV What Wright State Raiders forward Steven Davis did to a poor Urbana Blue Knights defender Tuesday was just plain disrespectful. Helping a teammate who was trapped by two defenders near the baseline, Davis made a cut to the basket. That's where the 6'8", 220-pound Raider encountered Blue Knights guard Dalton Payton (6'6", 180 lbs). Not only did Davis throw down all over Payton, but he seemingly used the defender as a ladder to get even higher. And you better believe the Wright State senior was hyped. You would not like Steven Davis when he is angry... ask the rim... and the defender... https://t.co/WWtdZIH2mQ OHHHH MY STEVEN DAVIS!! 😳💪🏼 https://t.co/OqaC1kN6Mp The poster dunk highlighted a 26-point performance by Davis in an 85-34 victory.
