If Theresa May loses the General Election in June, is Brexit over?


upposing – just supposing – that Theresa May fails to win a majority in the election on 8 June , would that mean Brexit is off? If ‘off’ means really, definitely off then the answer is simple: no.  Brexit was started by a referendum.  Only another referendum could stop it. aybe if a party won a majority having said, in terms, that it would stop the Brexit process if elected, it could claim a mandate for doing so.  But no party is going to put that pitch to the electorate: even the Liberal Democrats say only that they want a second referendum. In any case, a party could claim a mandate to overturn the referendum result only if it won a majority not just of seats in the Commons, but of votes in the country – something that no party has managed since before the Second World War. Without an electoral mandate to stop Brexit, even if some kind of Labour–SNP–Lib Dem government deal were to emerge...
