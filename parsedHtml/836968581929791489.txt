24 Perfectly Snarky Tweets About 'The Bachelor'
Dad is my Raquel üíÅüèª #TheBachelor  pic.twitter.com/312hCxy904     I complain when the episode is 2 hours long, I get annoyed when it's only 1 hour. #NeverSatisfied  #TheBachelor     "Whiskey or wine?" Oh, OK @viallnicholas28  #TheBachelor     That encounter between Andi and Nick was so natural. Not staged at all. #TheBachelor     "And then I kissed her after she vomited." #TheBachelor  pic.twitter.com/x44IQnW3uj     "If I knew what post bachelor life would be like, I would have never applied" - Alexis ( @awatazzz ) üòÇ #thebachelor     "Are you gonna have sex with any of them then?" This, folks, is what we call PAYBACK. #TheBachelor  pic.twitter.com/ALmvO0qfn4     plot twist: rachel is actually nick's pick in the end but she chooses being the next bachelorette instead #TheBachelor     I would like to show Andi what a feminist rant looks like. #thebachelor     What's sad is that Nick styles his hair as such each day and stands firm in that choice.     I definitely did NOT have Raven in my "First Woman to Say 'Orgasm' on This Season of #TheBachelor " office pool.     It went "incredibly," Corinne. That's an adverb to modify the verb "went." Incredible is an adjective that describes a noun. #TheBachelor     No, but really, you have nothing to regret because you carried this show, Corrine. #TheBachelor     "Why can't I just have a normal relationship?" Probably because you're an adult with a nanny.... #TheBachelor     You'll be ok, Corinne. Take that limo straight to the Meatpacking district #TheBachelor     Corinne went out with a nap #TheBachelor     TFW you know the Reject Limo is going to take you straight to @BachParadise . #TheBachelor  pic.twitter.com/zyRVvP9ZvT     I hate it on the Bachelor when they make out on helicopters because you guys, you're missing a good view, do that later!!     MAKE AMERICA ORGASM AGAIN #TheBachelor     "Are you nervous?" "I'm a little nervous." #TheBachelor  pic.twitter.com/yw66N9YFSL     I haven't done a load of laundry that I haven't left in the dryer overnight in maybe 3 years. #TheBachelor     Should I be worried that I don't mind a man in a turtleneck? #TheBachelor is better than a therapist.     A series of unfortunate events. #TheBachelor  pic.twitter.com/WKujBkY8H7     I feel like Raven's super low off-the-shoulder top is in direct protest against Nick's turtleneck eating his chin. #TheBachelor    ALSO ON HUFFPOST Tweets About "The Bachelor" Season 21, Episode 8       Share this slide:       Watching #thebachelor tonight from my hometown, hiring a nanny to bring me sliced cucumbers and a glass of wine (make that a bottle) #excited MORE:
