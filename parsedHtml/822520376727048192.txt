With Obama leaving office, the hip-hop and music community have started to thank him for his service and wish him farewell. "We really gonna miss you champ. The good you've done & opportunities you've given. Truly never know what we've got til it's gone. Thank u," Kendrick Lamar wrote on Twitter. Adele also wished Obama farewell on Twitter, sharing a pic of him waving goodbye.
