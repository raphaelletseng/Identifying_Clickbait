After 40 years, the former stadiumÂ of the Detroit Lions will be torn down this spring, according to The Detroit News.

The massive buildingÂ cost $55.7 million to build when it was first constructed back in 1975. It hosted Super Bowl XVI in 1982, a Michael Jackson Victory Tour concert in 1984, the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the legendary Wrestlemania III in 1987.

But by 2002, the Detroit Lions had moved into Ford Field in downtown DetroitÂ and the Silverdome was abandoned.

Since then, it's been used only sporadically and suffered major damage after aÂ 2013 winter storm destroyed its inflatable roof.

Photographer Johnny Joo gained access to the Silverdome back in 2014 and 2015. He toured the stadium with friends and shared hisÂ amazingÂ pictures of the now-defunct building with Tech Insider.
