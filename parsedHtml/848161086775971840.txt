The 10 most valuable brands in the world


Google has overtaken Apple to become the "most valuable global brand" this year, according to the rankings from brand consultancy Brand Finance.

Just like last year, technology brands dominated the top 10.

The ranking is based on interviews with more than 3 million consumers plus data on the financial and business performance of each company, using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel.

These are the top 10 most valuable brands in the world and an analysis of whatÂ happened over the last 12 months toÂ shift those companies into their respective rankings.
