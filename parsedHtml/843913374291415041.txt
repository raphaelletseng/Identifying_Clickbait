Extreme Foods Giant chicken looks like a ‘grown man in a costume,’ according to internet (iStock) Move over, 13-foot alligator — the internet is obsessed with a different enormous animal today. Footage of a ridiculously large chicken has been sweeping the internet after a Twitter user named LifesBook_CEO uploaded a video of the bulky bird on Sunday morning. In the clip, the large chicken can be seen emerging from its chicken coop and strutting around its pen, flapping its colossal wings and sauntering around on its massive haunches. “Am I the only person wondering why this chicken is so d--- big[?]” asked LifesBook_CEO in the caption. Am I the only person wondering why this chicken is so damn big 🤔🤔🤔 pic.twitter.com/ZIWmEL2h2w But judging by the video’s popularity, LifesBook_CEO is not alone in his bewilderment. In fact, Some Twitter users are actually skeptical that what they’re looking at is — in fact — a chicken. I still refuse to believe that giant chicken video is real “So you’re going to tell me that’s not a grown a-- man in a costume!!!???” wrote one incredulous user, reports The Sun . “I still refuse to believe that giant chicken video is real,” wrote another. According to Mashable , however, the chicken in the footage is very likely a Brahma chicken, a breed that was popular in the U.S. as a source of meat during the turn of the 20 century. This particular breed can grow to weigh as much as 18 pounds, and was originally developed from species imported from Shanghai. The average boiler chicken in the U.S. weighs just under 6 pounds, according to USDA statistics. The site also pegs this particular chicken as being from Kosovo, since the footage was initially uploaded to a chicken-themed Facebook group based in the country. Mashable says the larger than life bird's name is Merakli. Despite the scientific explanation behind the gigantic bird, Twitter is still having a hard time processing Merakli’s existence. I'd like a 2,000-word explainer about that big chicken video, please. everytime i close my eyes i see that big chicken. i cant breathe. it's all i think about that video of the giant chicken scares the living hell out of me So on second thought, it’s not so surprising that many believe Merakli is just an adult human in a chicken suit: @LifesBook_Ceo Bruh, this ain't no chicken. Who really finna try to cook this grown man.
