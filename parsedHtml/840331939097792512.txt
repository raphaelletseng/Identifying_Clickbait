It was within the first few weeks of the latest series airing that the announcement was made, but at the time of filming, none of the contestants had any idea.   Mary Berry reveals why she couldn't leave the BBC for GBBO “We found out at the same time as the audience at home,” Andrew told . “When we were in the tent, we were so busy focussing on the next bake and we had no clue what was going on behind the scenes,” he explains. Much like everyone else, the contestants were surprised by the news. However, the ever enthusiastic Andrew remains positive about the award-winning TV show’s transition. “Sometimes change is exciting,” he says. “It’s easy to jump on board a bandwagon and say it’s going to be one way or the other, but I personally am keen to see what Channel 4 do with it.

Andrew Smyth made his way into the hearts of the nation on last year’s Great British Bake Off with his animated facial expressions, creative bakes and Northern Irish lilt (certain viewers were known to swoon every time he said the word ‘elderflower’).

Alongside Jane Beedle and eventual winner Candice Brown, Andrew baked his way to the grand final, which for many was particularly poignant after it was announced that this was the final series of Bake Off on the BBC before the programme was bought by Channel 4.

It was within the first few weeks of the latest series airing that the announcement was made, but at the time of filming, none of the contestants had any idea.

“We found out at the same time as the audience at home,” Andrew told The Independent.

“When we were in the tent, we were so busy focussing on the next bake and we had no clue what was going on behind the scenes,” he explains.

Much like everyone else, the contestants were surprised by the news. However, the ever enthusiastic Andrew remains positive about the award-winning TV show’s transition.

Since Bake Off, however, the 25-year-old Cambridge graduate from County Down has continued working for Rolls Royce in Derby, where he designs jet engines.

Andrew Smyth’s top tips for creatively-engineered bakes:

1. Planning is key

We regularly saw Andrew on Bake Off with detailed hand-drawn diagrams guiding him through his bakes.

2. Measure everything carefully

Precision is crucial in both scientific experiments and baking.

3. Question your assumptions

“Asking yourself ‘what if?’ is a catalyst for creativity and often that was what happened on Bake Off for me,” Andrew explains. Ask yourself what you’d love to make in an ideal world if anything was possible and go from there.

4. Find your problem

Having a problem to solve often gets your creative juices flowing, according to Andrew: “Often my best ideas come out of being stumped on how to do it.”

5. Trial and error

It’s so easy to just throw in the towel when something goes wrong but you should embrace it. “I don’t think I’ve ever made anything that’s gone perfectly to plan the first time. That’s the nature of experimenting.”

Fortunately he has a lot of hungry housemates.
