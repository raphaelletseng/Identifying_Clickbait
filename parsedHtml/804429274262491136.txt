This is the dramatic moment a group of swimmers formed a human chain to save an ice skater who fell though ice.

The skater was an elderly man who was skating on a thin surface on November 23 in Fushun City, Liaoning province, reports the People's Daily Online.

The group eventually managed to pull him to safety using a rope.

In the footage, the swimmers can be seen walking on the ice while forming a human chain.

One of the swimmers is lying on the thin ice with a rope as the others pull each other to try and get the elderly man out of the water.

After some time, the elderly man is pulled to a thicker part of ice.

The man was then able to stand up.

Many people have criticised the man on social media site QQ for taking risks on the ice.

One user said: 'He's so old, why was he skating on ice? Didn't he know that the ice surface is fragile.'

And another wrote: 'The old man still hasn't learned that it's dangerous to skate on the icy lake.'
