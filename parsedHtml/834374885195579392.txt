Mohammad Marandi: Iran crucial in stopping IS - BBC News


The pro-Iranian government academic Prof Mohammad Marandi has said Iran has been crucial in stopping the advance of so-called Islamic State.

Prof Marandi from the University of Tehran said: "If it wasn't for Iran there would be black flags in Damascus today" - a reference to the black flags of IS.

He told Hardtalk's Zeinab Badawi: "If Iran had not supported Syria and the people in Lebanon we would not have a Syria today and we would not have a Lebanon and we probably would not have an Iraq."

The new US administration has "put Iran on notice" after it recently tested a missile and has also warned against Iranâ€™s "destabilising behaviour" across the Middle East.

US Secretary of Defence James Mattis said recently that Iran was "the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world".
