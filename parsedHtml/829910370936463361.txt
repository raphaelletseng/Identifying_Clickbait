https://t.co/UqMU9gux5w Oregon Ducks forward Dillon Brooks showed little regard for the hoop or for the UCLA Bruins' Ike Anigbogu in the first half of Thursday's game at Pauley Pavilion. Seven minutes into the opening frame, Brooks picked up quite a bit of steam as he approached the rim for a dunk. Anigbogu left his feet to make a play on the ball, but the Bruins forward only got posterized for his troubles.
