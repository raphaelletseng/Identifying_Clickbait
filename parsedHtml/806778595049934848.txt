Brexit: EU judges to decide on UK cases ‘for years after EU withdrawal’
Brexit: EU judges to decide on UK cases ‘for years after EU withdrawal’
Ministers have privately conceded European judges may still hold sway in post- Brexit legal disputes involving British parties, despite Theresa May vowing to end the authority of EU law. Members of the Government have come to the conclusion as they explore the “devilishly complex” task of winding down the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the UK. The admission could be embarrassing for the Prime Minister after she said in her flagship conference speech at Tory conference that the UK is not leaving the EU “only to return” to the ECJ’s jurisdiction. It also comes after the most senior British member of the Luxemburg court warned that it would have “ultimate authority ” on the Brexit case currently being fought at the UK’s Supreme Court.   Theresa May won't be getting a 'red, white and blue Brexit' Calling an end to the ECJ’s authority has formed a key plank of Ms May’s “Brexit means Brexit” strategy, but news of the intricate challenge now facing officials sheds light on the compromises that will lie beneath the Prime Minister’s black and white rhetoric. A Government source told : “Separating EU and UK law is like separating conjoined twins. Not ones that are attached at the arm, but ones attached at the head. “You need to take it very slowly and carefully. Every single nerve, every single synapse is important and if you cut through the wrong one it could have devastating consequences. “It’s going to be devilishly complex.” The source pointed to the hypothetical example of a dispute over a contract between a British and an EU party, signed during a period in which European law and the European Court is supreme. Brexit negotiators may have to decide which kinds of legal disputes can be solely settled in British courts and whether some may still be subject to the involvement of the European Court. Alternatively, they may agree to set up a new commission, the source said, with the involvement of both European officials as well as British ones. In her conference speech in October, Ms May set out how she would bring forward a Great Repeal Bill that will take all existing EU law into UK law and end the European Court of Justice’s authority in the UK.
