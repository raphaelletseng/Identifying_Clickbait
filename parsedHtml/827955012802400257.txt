The Kids’ Choice Awards are Fine With The Weeknd Trashing Them
The Kids’ Choice Awards are Fine With The Weeknd Trashing Them
In 2016, one of the ways The Weeknd countered his rising mainstream popularity was reacting to being nominated for a Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Award. Perhaps operating under the assumption that some of the buyers who helped push Abel to the top of the charts were also their underage viewers, the organizers for the Kids’ Choice Awards nominated the Toronto crooner in the Favorite Male Singer category. The lyrics from “Reminder” would indicate The Weeknd was aware of the nod. “I just won a new award for a kids show/Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow/I'm like, goddamn bitch I am not a Teen Choice/Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy,” Weeknd sang on 2016’s “Reminder,” referencing how “I Can’t Feel My Face” helped earn him a Kids’ Choice Awards nomination. Ultimately, he lost the nod for Favorite Male Singer to Justin Bieber. But with The Weeknd’s debuting at No. 1 while amassing the equivalent of 348,000 album units, giving him another nomination makes sense. Fellow Toronto native Drake—who doesn’t exactly make kid-friendly material either—was also nominated, along with Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars, and Shawn Mendes. #KCA Favorite Male Singer 🏆 Drake Justin Bieber Bruno Mars Shawn Mendes Justin Timberlake The Weeknd Weeknd’s point that songs about snorting cocaine aren’t Kids' Choice material stands, and it could make for some interesting television when the Kids’ Choice Awards air March 11. The tabloid fodder of Bieber calling Weeknd’s music wack after seeing The Weeknd cuddled up with Bieber's former flame Selena Gomez could bring some TMZ-level drama to Nickelodeon.

Weeknd’s point that songs about snorting cocaine aren’t Kids' Choice material stands, and it could make for some interesting television when the Kids’ Choice Awards air March 11. The tabloid fodder of Bieber calling Weeknd’s music wack after seeing The Weeknd cuddled up with Bieber's former flame Selena Gomez could bring some TMZ-level drama to Nickelodeon.
