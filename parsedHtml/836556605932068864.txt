Just a load of animals with pancakes because humans are weird
Humans aren't content with tossing pancakes and eating them in a civilised fashion on Pancake Day. They must also put pancakes on their pets. On Pancake Day, people are sharing photos of pancake #FoodPorn, but they're also sharing photos that are guaranteed to brighten your day. People are sharing adorable — and slightly weird — photos of animals wearing and eating pancakes.
