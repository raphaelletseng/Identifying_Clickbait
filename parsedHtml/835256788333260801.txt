JaVale McGee and Shaq's Twitter war went 0 to 100, real quick
Brace for impact, folks. This is officially a full-on Twitter war.Â A pre-existing feud between former NBA star Shaquille O'Neill and Golden State Warriors center JaVale McGee flared up again late Thursday night with a series of hot tweets, the content of which included violent threats, nut emoji and not-so-savory photoshopped images. Â SEE ALSO: In pep talk fail, Jameis Winston tells elementary school girls they're 'supposed to be silent' First, some context.Â Shaq â€”Â an analyst on TNT's â€” hosts a segment called "Shaqtin' a Fool," which essentially exists to troll NBA players. McGee â€” who has found new life with the Warriors this season â€”Â has long been known as a walking lowlight reel, with a wealth of missed free throws, botched dunks and just general clumsiness to his name. He's a consistent target of Shaq's segment but isn't too happy about it.Â McGee threw some shade at the segment in October, and the two had a minor exchange on Twitter in January, but things really went south this week. After the Warriors' 123-113 win over the Clippers on Thursday, Shaq aired a hilarious Dr. Strange parody â€” featuring all of McGee's worst gaffes â€” to troll Golden State's center once again.

A pre-existing feud between former NBA star Shaquille O'Neill and Golden State Warriors center JaVale McGee flared up again late Thursday night with a series of hot tweets, the content of which included violent threats, nut emoji and not-so-savory photoshopped images. Â

First, some context.Â

Shaq â€”Â an analyst on TNT's Inside the NBA â€” hosts a segment called "Shaqtin' a Fool," which essentially exists to troll NBA players. McGee â€” who has found new life with the Warriors this season â€”Â has long been known as a walking lowlight reel, with a wealth of missed free throws, botched dunks and just general clumsiness to his name. He's a consistent target of Shaq's segment but isn't too happy about it.Â

McGee threw some shade at the segment in October, and the two had a minor exchange on Twitter in January, but things really went south this week.

After the Warriors' 123-113 win over the Clippers on Thursday, Shaq aired a hilarious Dr. Strange parody â€” featuring all of McGee's worst gaffes â€” to troll Golden State's center once again.

McGee had enough. He fired back with a bomb.Â

Shaq finished off the battle with some handy photo editing, the contents of which are still up for debate.Â
