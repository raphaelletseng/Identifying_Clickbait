Review: ‘Amélie’ Is Easy to Listen To, but Never Really Sings
For a cunning little bauble of an entertainment, the 2001 French film “Amélie” inspired uncommonly extreme responses. People were usually head over heels about it (“It’s so cute!”) or violently allergic to it (“But it’s so cute!”). The mild-mannered musical adaptation of this movie, which opened on Monday night at the Walter Kerr Theater, is unlikely to stir similar passions. Featuring a book by Craig Lucas and music by Daniel Messé, with the lush-voiced Philippa Soo in the title role, it is pleasant to look at, easy to listen to and oddly recessive. It neither offends nor enthralls. Say what you will about its cinematic prototype, directed with an auteur’s flourish by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it had style to spare, not to mention the courage of its worldly but whimsical convictions. In other words, “Amélie” the movie was très, très Français. “Amélie” the musical seems to have no nationality, or sensibility, to call its own. Translating Mr. Jeunet’s work, not only from one language (and its culture) to another, but also from the screen to the stage, took the kind of fully committed courage that its shy titular heroine (Ms. Soo) must acquire to achieve a happy ending. So all credit to this show’s creative team, overseen by the director Pam MacKinnon, for giving coherent life to a tale that exists as much in Amélie’s imagination as in anywhere else. “I can see the world I’m dreaming all around me,” sings Young Amélie (a charmingly poker-faced Savvy Crawford), the isolated daughter of overprotective but unloving parents (Manoel Felciano and Alison Cimmet). The show’s very clever designers — including David Zinn (set and costumes), Jane Cox and Mark Barton (lighting), and Peter Nigrini (the delightful projections) — and its 13-member, multiple-cast ensemble dutifully transform dreams into flesh (and fabric, wood, paper and plastic). Advertisement For even after the Amélie of the early 1980s grows up to become the beautiful Ms. Soo of 1997, which happens 10 minutes or so into the show, and moves to Paris on her own, she continues to use her carefully composed fantasies to insulate herself from harsh and hurtful life. (During her childhood, her mom was killed before her eyes by a large man who jumped from the roof of Notre Dame Cathedral.) Advertisement Inspired by the noble image of Princess Diana, whose life and death are a subject of much discussion at the cafe where Amélie works as a waitress, she decides to do good in the world. But she must do so on her terms, which means invisibly and, needless to say, most whimsically. An eavesdropper on the lives of others, she anonymously restores lost property, arranges romances and mobilizes her stagnating widowed father into activity, by stealing a garden gnome from a shrine he built to his dead wife. (Yes, that’s right. And the gnome in this version, unlike the one in the movie, becomes an animated, singing character. But never mind.) Excerpt: 'Amélie' Phillipa Soo sings "Times Are Hard For Dreamers" from the new Broadway musical. Advertisement In the course of her acts of voyeuristic virtue, Amélie sets eyes on the equally fanciful Nino (Adam Chanler-Berat). He works as a clerk in a porn shop, but his life’s obsession is collecting strips of pictures that are thrown away at photo booths. If you haven’t realized Amélie has found her soul mate, the ensemble is there to cue you by opening suitcases to reveal sparkling hearts. But how does a young woman untrained in social communication finally connect with another human being? Dufayel (Tony Sheldon), a twinkly old artist in the apartment across the way, gently pushes her toward her destiny, with the visual aid of a Renoir painting he spends his days copying again and again. (Once more, don’t ask.) Advertisement As you have surely gathered by now, “Amélie” is aggressively cute and quirky. The film’s preciousness is balanced, to some degree, by the philosophical resignation of its unseen narrator. Even Mr. Jeunet’s inventive, cinema-infatuated mise-en-scène is steeped in a sort of “so it goes” (or “ça va”) drollery, sentimentality plus cynicism being the quintessential French equation. That delicate balance teeters when it’s rendered via swelling song and skipping dance. (The musical staging and choreography are by Sam Pinkleton.) That the show’s creators are aware of the potential dangers of cloying cuteness probably accounts for its seeming so subdued, even as frolicsome puppets (by Amanda Villalobos) take the stage. Advertisement Although the lyrics (by Mr. Messé and Nathan Tysen) have an agreeable flow, the score proceeds in a smooth pastel stream that suggests pink Champagne gone a bit flat. The score includes more choral “oohs” than any show since the moony “Bridges of Madison County,” along with a lot of sprightly “bum-da-bum-bums.” Only occasionally does it open up to allow Ms. Soo and Mr. Chanler-Berat to display their pop power-ballad singing chops. The cast members refrain from over-signaling their characters’ eccentricity, which is a blessing. Unfortunately, they also tend to turn pale and watery before your eyes, like sidewalk chalk drawings in the rain. Advertisement This is true even of Ms. Soo, an actress of distinctive musical talent. She brought a rhapsodic passion to her roles in “Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812” (in its Off Broadway incarnations) and “Hamilton.” Like Audrey Tautou, who became an international star in the movie “Amélie,” she bears a resemblance to film’s all-time favorite waif-woman, Audrey Hepburn. But while Ms. Tautou summoned Hepburn the mischievous gamin, Ms. Soo evokes Ms. Hepburn’s more stately and serene side, the princess in “Roman Holiday.” Playing withdrawn, as she does here, Ms. Soo tends to become a blank; in repose, her luminous face gives few clues to what’s going on inside Amélie’s ever-churning mind. “The world is reaching out to catch me, but we’ve yet to really meet,” sings Young Amélie, early in the show. That disconnect between girl and world might be said to parallel that of this tentative show and its audience.
