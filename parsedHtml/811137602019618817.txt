Persuading singers to perform at his inauguration isn’t the only problem Donald Trump seems to be having.

The ceremony that will pronounce him the 45th President of the United States is still only in its formative stages and yet already hitting brick walls.

High-profile figures are hardly rushing to attach their names to the gig and now David Foster, renowned record producer and father to supermodel siblings Gigi and Bella Hadid, has denied reports he is organising the President-elect's inauguration.

Foster released a statement denying his involvement to US Weekly after a report in Page Six said Foster was dealing with the unenviable task of “wrangling talent to perform at the January event”.

"I was invited to participate and I politely declined,” Foster said in response. "I have no idea where this story came from. Neither me nor my manager was ever contacted by Page Six or any other media outlet.”

Foster’s cordial thanks, but no thanks, comes in spite of a long-standing friendship the tabloid claims he has with Mr Trump.

Confirmed talent for the ceremony on 20 January is America's Got Talent season 5 runner-up Jackie Evancho - and that’s it, to date. Andrea Bocelli is rumoured to be lined up, but there has been no official comment from his camp. If Bocelli was considering a request from Mr Trump’s team, he might be dissuaded by his fans who are currently threatening to boycott his music should he go ahead.

A claim by transition team member Anthony Scaramucci that Elton John had agreed to perform was swiftly shot down by the singer himself, who said in no uncertain terms he would not be performing.

A spokesperson for Mr Trump did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent.

Mr Trump also has a more pressing problem to contend with in the form of increasingly vocal detractors such as Michael Moore. The documentarian determined not to give him an easy ride to the Oval Office is urging the groundswell of opposition to Mr Trump to manifest their anger into protests, disruption and civil disobedience up until and beyond his inauguration.
