Seven-time Grammy Award-winning jazz and pop singer Al Jarreau has died in Los Angeles at the age of 76, his publicist says.

The cause of his death was not immediately clear. He was in a hospital being treated for exhaustion.

Earlier this month, he retired from touring after more than 50 years.

A rare artist to have won a Grammy in jazz, pop and R&B categories, Jarreau was famed for writing the theme to hit television show Moonlighting.

He was acclaimed for his versatility and after receiving awards as a jazz singer, he crossed over into pop.

In 1981, he launched Breakin Away, which included the hit We're in This Love Together, which catapulted him to fame.

According to a post on the star's Twitter profile, his son had recently caught Jarreau singing Moonlighting to one of the nurses in hospital.

A statement on his website read: "His 2nd priority in life was music. There was no 3rd. His 1st priority, far ahead of the other, was healing or comforting anyone in need.

"Whether it was emotional pain, or physical discomfort, or any other cause of suffering, he needed to put our minds at ease and our hearts at rest."
