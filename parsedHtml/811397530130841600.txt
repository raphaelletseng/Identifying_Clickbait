29 Cats That Are A Friggin' Holiday Miracle
“I never asked to be in this picture.” “Shh, don’t tell them I’m down here!” “Don’t touch my branch.” “We’re elves.” “The holidays are about relaxation.” “I’m all out of presents?” “Wait…I actually have to pull the sleigh?” “I haven’t even started my shopping yet.” “We should focus on what the holidays are really about: me.” “You said there would be no more costumes.” “We better get a treat if you’re making us wear these things.” “This sweater really brings out my eyes.” “Just making sure the lights work.” “I refuse to wear this.” “Can I come out now?” “I don’t know how I ended up here.” “Why did you wake me up from my nap?” “This is my house. I have to defend it.” “I’m just trying to blend in.” “I didn’t know the tree was off limits.” “I am a master of disguise.” “It’s not MY fault the tree is so wobbly.” “Can I help you?” “No, I will not be moving.” “No, it’s not me. I’m an ornament.” “An angel? I should be at the top of the tree.” “Sure, the tree is nice, but have you seen ME?” “What’s going on out there?” “I’ll come out when winter is over.” Can’t get enough cats?
