Earlier this week, DMX canceled three shows in California due to a “medical emergency.” His Santa Ana, Los Angeles, and San Diego performances were postponed due to the health concern.

Now we have more detail on what DMX is going through: the rapper has checked into a rehab facility, according to TMZ. DMX reportedly checked himself into a Southern California facility on Thursday night.

TMZ states it was a decision he made on his own—he reportedly felt himself “moving to a dark place” and wanted to correct it—though he was encouraged by his ex-wife, Tashera Simmons, and manager, Pat Gallo.

Gallo released a statement that included an apology to fans for the postponed concerts.

"It is important right now that he take some time off to focus on his health so that he can be a better father, friend and entertainer,” Gallo said. “We are eternally grateful for the outpouring of concern and support that has poured in. We ask that you please keep X in your prayers as he embraces your support."

DMX entered rehab in 2002 to treat a drug addiction. It is not clear at this point whether he is in rehab for drug or alcohol abuse.

Barclays Center in Brooklyn hosted a Ruff Ryders reunion last week. Reports indicated DMX “struggled mightily,” and TMZ reports DMX—who was noticeably emotional at points onstage—was drinking heavily before the show.
