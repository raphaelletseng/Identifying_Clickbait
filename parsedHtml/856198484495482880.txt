9 Reasons Why You Need To Travel Solo At Least Once In Your Lifetime! Sometimes, a solo trip is the solution of all of your life problems. It is when you get away from the hustle and bustle of your daily life, you get some time to think and introspect about where your life is going. When you take a road less travelled, you come back as a completely different person because your journey helps you to give you a change of perspective. Here are nine reasons why you must pack your bags and go wherever you want to without anybody else tagging along. 1. It makes you aware of your choices Travelling is all about making choices. Will you stay in an expensive hotel or a simple AirBnb works for you? Will you take a longer path or a shortcut to reach a destination? Would you spend or rather save while you’re travelling? It is when you make choices in life, you start to learn what you prefer and what you don't. 2. You get some ‘me’ time You’re not going to get any ‘me time’ in your daily routine, and therefore you have to get out of the mundane routine and take out time for a vacation. The time which you take off for your solo travel is your ‘me time’, in which you can do everything your routine didn’t allow you to do. 3. You meet new people and learn new things about life A new place is an opportunity to interact with new people and to know more about their lives. It is when we open up to them, we realise that the world is huge and our circle of acquaintances is too small. 4. You realise you’re cribbing and whining over all the wrong things And that there is so much more to life than a new phone, car or a job. You would realise that you’re just a small speck in this colossal universe and that there are more important problems than your ‘first world problems’. 5. You realise the power of disconnecting

Sometimes, a solo trip is the solution of all of your life problems. It is when you get away from the hustle and bustle of your daily life, you get some time to think and introspect about where your life is going. When you take a road less travelled, you come back as a completely different person because your journey helps you to give you a change of perspective.

Here are nine reasons why you must pack your bags and go wherever you want to without anybody else tagging along.

Travelling is all about making choices. Will you stay in an expensive hotel or a simple AirBnb works for you? Will you take a longer path or a shortcut to reach a destination? Would you spend or rather save while you’re travelling? It is when you make choices in life, you start to learn what you prefer and what you don't.

Every day, we’re bombarded with unwanted information that consumes a lot of our time and energy. It is when we switch our phones off during our solo trip, we are then able to focus on our thoughts because there is no disturbance from the virtual world.

6. You stop underestimating yourself

Before embarking on the journey alone, you had self-doubts about whether you would be able to complete the journey by yourself. Once you’re back home or during your way, it would dawn upon you that it takes guts for what you just did. You travelled a thousand miles without anybody and enjoyed your own company. Your self-esteem gets a boost and you start feeling stronger.

7. You start understanding the difference between loneliness and being alone

Being alone makes you calm and composed. You no more crib about a ‘special someone’ not being present in your life. You’d realise you’re a free bird who has no strings attached at all.

8. You would forgive yourself and start anew

Before starting anything new, you’ve got to get away from the usual rut and contemplate about your future plans. Your solo travel would make you to let your hair down and teach you to enjoy the small joys of life. You would forgive yourself for the past and resolve to start afresh.

9. You will learn to prioritise

A good solo trip would enhance your management skills. You would manage your time well, you would know how to prioritise things and to ignore things which are of no use to you.
