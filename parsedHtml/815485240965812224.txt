2015-2016 Revealed A Strict Side Of Censor Board, 135 Hindi Films Were Given 'A' Certificate! 2016 was quite a rollercoaster ride for Hindi films. While we did see makers picking up mature topics for their films, the reception of the same by the censor board was nothing short of a disappointment. According to the annual report released by the CBFC, the number of Hindi films that were cleared with A certificate in the year 2015-2016 were a whopping 135! Going by the records of the year 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 which were 44 and 102 respectively, 2015-16 witnessed a lot of tussles between the filmmakers and the censor board. Come on, how can we forget Anurag Kashyap’s ?! It clearly created a divide between the film fraternity and the Board. The report further said that 65 Hindi films were given U certificate. In total approximately 1.021 films were censored by CBFC in 2015-16. Not just the Hindi film industry but even South Indian films experienced a similar fate. Out of the 259 Tamil films released during the year, 10.24 per cent were adult certified, while the figures for A certified films in Malayalam stood at 7.09 per cent. In fact, about 67 Bhojpuri films were certified out of which 54 per cent were for adult viewing. Out of 180 Marathi films that were released last year, 127 were cleared out of which four were given A certificate. The report also revealed that 94 films were denied censor certificate due to vulgarity and objections on scripts.
