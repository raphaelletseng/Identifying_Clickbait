Big spoiler. https://t.co/kmwXNaOEtT â€” J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) April 26, 2017 Okay, okay: so that's not exactly much to go on, is it? But just the fact that it a spoiler (and a big one, at that) tells us that Newt's patronus is obviously going to feature heavily in the second film. And what do we know about patronus'? Well, as was the case with Snape, they can be influenced by a person that the wizard or witch has been in love with. Combine that with the fact J.K. Rowling has already said we'll find out more about Leta Lestrange â€” Newt's childhood love â€” in the next film, and it seems likely that Newt's patronus will have something to do with her.
