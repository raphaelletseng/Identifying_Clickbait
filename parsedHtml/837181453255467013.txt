Republican slams Democratic women for wearing white to Trump’s speech
Representative Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., strongly criticized the Democratic congresswomen who wore white to President Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, dismissing the move as “weird” and characterizing it as an homage to Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential bid. “But by the way, did you notice how poorly several of them were dressed, as well?” Cramer said Wednesday, during a radio town hall broadcast from Fargo, N.D., Politico reported. “It is a syndrome. There is no question. There is a disease associated with the notion that a bunch of women would wear bad-looking white pantsuits in solidarity with Hillary Clinton to celebrate her loss. You cannot get that weird.” Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla., the chair of the House Democratic Women’s Working Group, whose district encompasses Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, led the effort to wear white, in order to visibly promote gender equality.
