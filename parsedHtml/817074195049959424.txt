The Think & Learn Smart Cycle is stationary bike that allows kids to play educational video games on a connected TV or tablet while pedaling through the level. The faster they pedal, the faster the game goes. It's not completely unlike that one episode of Image:  LILI SAMS/MASHABLE The bike comes with four games that focus on literacy, STEM exposure, math skills, science and social studies, and the company plans to launch more in 2018. The bike can either hook up to streaming devices on a TV via Bluetooth or parents can download the app on iOS or Android and use a tablet. Parents can also download an accompanying app that can can provide feedback, and they can monitor their progression. Nitya Madhavan, Vice President of Marketing at  Fisher-Price said the toy was inspired by the fact that preschoolers take in information best while they're active and enjoying the activity, so what better way than to have them play video games.
