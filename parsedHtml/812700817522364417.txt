NFL POWER RANKINGS: Where all 32 teams stand heading into Week 16
NFL POWER RANKINGS: Where all 32 teams stand heading into Week 16


With just two weeks of regular season football remaining, the playoff picture is finally starting to gain some clarity.

Four teams have already clinched: the Patriots, Raiders, Cowboys, and Seahawks are all in, while the Chiefs and GiantsÂ (both with 10 wins) look well-positioned to lock downÂ the first Wild Card in their respective conferences.

After that, though, there's still a lot up in the air.

The Packers are now just one game behind the Lions in the NFC North, and the two teams square off in a Week 17 contest that could be an elimination game. Elsewhere, the Steelers are trying to hold off the Ravens in the AFC North, the Falcons are trying to hold off the Bucs in the NFC South, and in the AFC South the Texans, Titans, and Colts are all still alive. Don't count out the DolphinÂ or Redskins out of the Wild Card just yet, either.Â

All in all, with only two weeks left a loss could completely derail a season.

Happy holidays, and happy football!
