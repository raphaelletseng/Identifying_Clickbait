Biggest Celebrity Feuds of 2016
With all the horrible things going on in the world, you’d think this would be the year celebrities would put their differences aside and get along? Yeah, right! While Twitter feuds were still all the rage, many celebs’ fighting words were more than 140 characters long. Take a look back at some of the biggest celeb beefs of 2016.

Tempers were flying high on the set of the testosterone-heavy Fast 8 film. In August, Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson went off on a rant against his male co-stars on Instagram, writing, “Some conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don’t. The ones that don’t are too chicken s*** to do anything about it anyway. Candy a**es,” he said. “When you watch this movie next April and it seems like I’m not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling — you’re right.” His post immediately launched speculation as to who the rant could have been about. Multiple outlets later confirmed Vin Diesel was the target. Apparently the disagreement was over creative differences. Diesel has been with the franchise since the very beginning and has been a producer since the fourth film. Fortunately, the two action stars met on set to hash out their differences and they appear to be all good. “I was raised on healthy conflict and welcome it,” Johnson later Instagrammed. “And like any family, we get better from it.” (Photo: AP Images)
