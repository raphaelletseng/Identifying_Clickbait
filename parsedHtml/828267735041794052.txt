In A Selfless Act, This 22-YO Woman Donated A Part Of Her Liver To A Girl She Babysits! Very seldom do we come across selfless souls who set great examples of humanity and make this world a better place, one good deed at a time. Kiersten Miles is one such soul who recently donated a part of her liver to Talia - the toddler she had been babysitting for just a few months. Only a few weeks into her new job, Miles learned that Talia - the youngest of the three children - had a liver condition and wouldn't survive without a transplant. Miles decided to get tested to check whether she was a match for Talia or not. Miles tested positive like it was fate. The babysitter recently wrote a message of gratitude for everyone who had congratulated her on saving the young girl's life. Talia's condition was known as biliary atresia wherein the liver's ducts clog up with bile. Had she not received the transplant, her liver cells would have completely destroyed proving fatal. Talia's mother warned Miles of the risks involved but the nanny went ahead with the 14-hour long operation anyway. Miles recovered in just nine days and is now trying to raise awareness about organ donation.

Miles knew that she will never be able to donate in her life again but still did not back out from her commitment. More power to this woman and everyone who believes that a sacrifice is worth the life it saves.
