Kendrick Lamar's "DNA" Hit With Ridiculous Biting Claims
Kendrick Lamar 's single "DNA" has been hit with ridiculous claims of biting . A SoundCloud upload from an artist known as D.Zign is played side-by-side with Lamar's track in an Instagram clip spotted by Friday, with emphasis placed on the "I got, I got, I got, I got" portions of "DNA." Some might not understand how we feel about this here situation..but we work to hard and put in alot of our time into this...just knowing how dedicated you is to something & how much you had to sacrifice for it...I dont think nobody could wake up and hear someone reciting they rhymes in a new song & not feel a way. Somebody tell me who would of just thought to rap iGot iGot iGot like that? The same way? Idk man...what yall think? #DZign #DotitEnt #KendrickLamar #iGotiGotiGot #DNA #AirHeadFame @theshaderoom @balleralert @akadmiks @worldstar @vladtv @theartistdzign @bgkat @bgknocc.out @losangelesconfidential @Kendricklamar A post shared by AirHeadüéàFame | #üíµüèäüèæ (@airheadfame) on Apr 25, 2017 at 12:29pm PDT D.Zign addressed the "DNA" claims in separate Instagram posts, telling one commenter that he first released his track in "June 2015" and¬†that he just wanted to "seek answers and live with the final result, whatever they may be." D.Zign also accused Lamar of stealing "my shit." ü§îü§îü§î SO...KENDRICK JUST GONNA STEAL MY SHIT ON HIS "DNA" SONG?

(@theartistdzign) on Apr 26, 2017 at 9:26am PDT As some Lamar fans have noted in the posts' comments and elsewhere , the argument here seems like a bit of a reach. The two tracks are vastly different in terms of style and execution, not to mention the fact that pinning the entire argument to the repetition of "I got" isn't very convincing. Amid the claims, D.Zign¬†has released a "No Humble" freestyle over an instrumental of Lamar's "Humble." "DNA" landed at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 this month, boosted by the track's Don Cheadle -starring video. In fact, literally every song from charted the same week that lead single "Humble" earned Lamar his first No. 1 as a lead act.¬†Fans can catch on the road this summer thanks to a just-announced tour featuring support from Travis Scott and D.R.A.M.
