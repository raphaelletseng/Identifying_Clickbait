Adidas Readies the Next Ultra Boost
Adidas Readies the Next Ultra Boost


Smart enough to know that there's no point in rushing a true sequel to retail, Adidas continues to find success redesigning the existing Ultra Boost runner. After rolling out the Ultra Boost 3.0 last fall, the next generation is set to hit retail soon.

Here's a look at the new Adidas Ultra Boost in "Triple White" and Core Black/Dark Grey colorways. Adidas explores different patterns and directions on this version of the model, included a perforated look near the cage. Otherwise, they remain pretty consistent with the hardware and tooling. Yeezy Mafia dubs this make-up the Ultra Boost 3.1, a precursor to the Ultra Boost 3.5 launching later this year.

A U.S. release date hasn't been announced yet, but overseas retailers like Zalando are already selling pairs. Keep an eye out for updates moving forward.
