This Photographer Traveled To 20 Countries To Show The Beauty Of Redheads
Carmen from Netherlands            Chelbie from South Carolina                     "It started as a fun Instagram project. I was working as an entertainment photographer in L.A. at the time, and I would post photos of the redheads I saw on the red carpet or at parties," Brian told BuzzFeed. "It eventually turned into me photographing Instagram followers when I was traveling Europe. At one point I posted I would be in Stuttgart, Germany and six of my followers wrote me. I decided to just focus on non-celebs and on making a portrait book from as many countries as my bank account would allow."              Ely from Viareggio, Italy            Alina from Kiev, Ukraine                     "Because redheads are unique and awesome. Also, as a photographer I think they photograph beautifully. My grandparents are also Irish. So, maybe that has something to do with it as well."              Alia from Berlin, Germany            Alyssa from Austin, Texas                     "I learned that ruined a lot of childhoods. I started asking people if they were bullied for being redheads, and even across Europe, many people brought up that infamous episode . On a positive note, I learned that people really appreciated what I was doing and that having red hair makes you a member of this elite club."              Beata from Warsaw, Poland            Bridget from San Francisco, California                     "I want people to know I am not expecting to change the world nor can one man photograph every type of redhead in the world. It was just a fun project and I just want my photos to make someone's day a little bit brighter. I want non-redheads to realize that most of the women in my project were bullied when they were growing up. I want the redheads out there to be strong and don't let bullies change their viewpoint of the world."              Maria from Russia            Natasha from London, England.                     "I would love to have an exhibit when the time is right. I'm still a bit in shock at the amount of good feedback from my Kickstarter campaign, but I still have that underlying fear that nobody would buy my prints."              Eilis from Northern Ireland            Kim from Hamburg, Germany                     "This was a small self-funded project and I would like to keep expanding on it. I live in Germany and for the most part, I just traveled nearby. Hopefully with the proper funding, I can take this project to more diverse places like Mexico, Brazil, Israel, Turkey, and Lebanon. I'd also think it'd be fun to go on a road trip across America."              Daria from Russia            Elainna from Modesto, California
