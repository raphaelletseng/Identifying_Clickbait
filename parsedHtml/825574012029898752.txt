Protests against Trump's immigration order have erupted across the country â here's what they are like


Protesters descended on airports across the country on Saturday, in the wake of President Donald Trump's executive order blocking travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US.

"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over," Trump told media in Washington D.C., as demonstratorsÂ swarmed John F. Kennedy airport in New York City.

The protests kicked off Saturday afternoon after two Iraqi refugees who had been granted asylum and were carrying valid visas were detained by border agents.

Both men were eventually released, and a federal judge in Brooklyn issued an emergency ruling preventing the deportation of all travelers that had arrived in the US with valid visas and been detained.
