Young Thug Acts Like A Jerk In The Airport, Twitter Claps Back
Young Thug is receiving major backlash after he posted footage of himself disrespecting airline workers. On Wednesday night, the rapper posted an Instagram video in which he is seen arguing with two female Alaska Airlines employees whom, he claims, were trying to make him miss his flight. “THIS IS Y I RIDE SIGNATURE JETS,” he captioned the post. “THEY TRYIN TO MAKE ME MISS MY SHOW!” THIS IS Y I RIDE signature JETS..... THEY TRYIN TO MAKE ME MISS MY SHOW!!! https://t.co/RIqf54jro5 The video shows Thugger referring to the women as “ants,” “peasants,” and “bums” before offering them $15,000 to quit their day jobs. But he didn’t stop there. Thug then went on to insult the employees’ hair—saying “they look like Africans” that “got deported"—and declared himself “bigger than the law.” The Atlanta rapper might’ve thought the video was funny, but Twitter wasn’t having it. YOUNG THUG CANCELED AS FUCK! Young Thug, I love you but you are so fuckin petty for that shit. Young Thug inaudible ass is cancelled. Could never understand what he said anyway Young Thug canceled pic.twitter.com/3CCGoqUiPo Young thug a certified bitch Young Thug proved once again how wack he really is under that fluff. His music is trash and he's a shit person for that. young thug is my favorite hip hop artist but this level of deep rooted misogyny against black women is unacceptable. https://t.co/IyUpIi5b3f Young thug way too ugly to roast anyone. Young thug hella disrespectful for that shit smh young thug lame as hell for acting like that to them ladies, rude or not calling them bums? tryna pay em to quit? peasants? her hair nappy? Young Thug is whack for that Young thug should be ashamed of hisself 😒 prime example of putting down your own ppl ,him bringing up her being from Africa and her hair smh Alaska Airlines officials told Thug was supposed to catch a flight from Atlanta to Seattle; however, he arrived after the 45-minute cutoff time. Sources say he was able to get on a partner flight, so it’s still possible for him to take the stage in Seattle tonight. Thug is currently on his Hi’Horsed tour with 21 Savage.
