Von Miller wears weird cleats.

Earler this season, the Denver Broncos linebacker wore spiked pregame cleats before facing the Oakland Raiders. Last Sunday, he flaunted feathered "rooster" cleats leading up to the matchup with the Tennessee Titans.

Miller continued his trend of showcasing bizarre footwear by teasing furry cleats on his Instagram account. He tagged Washington cornerback Josh Norman and late-night comedian Conan O'Brien in a callback to a "Clueless Gamer" segment where the "hat buddies" all donned furry headgear.

Those cleats may help keep Miller warm before Sunday's showdown with the New England Patriots, but they're certainly not league-approved for actual in-game use.
