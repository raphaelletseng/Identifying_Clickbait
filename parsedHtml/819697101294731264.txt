Indian barber cuts men’s hair… by setting it on FIRE 


This Indian barber has found an innovative way of cutting men's hair... by setting it on fire.

Footage from inside his salon shows the maverick barber pouring a flammable powder and liquid over his customer's head before holding a lighter up against his locks, which promptly catch alight.

While the customer's head is still ablaze, the barber then takes two combs, which he used to cut and style the hair into shape, while the flames continue to burn.

Once the flames have burned out, the barber continues with the haircut as a crowd of men stand and watch him perform his unusual technique.

After combing through his client's hair, the barber shakes on more of the powder onto his head, and once again sets his barnet alight.

Apparently unperturbed by the heat from the flames, the hairdresser combs through his clients locks, while parts of his hair fall away.

The savvy stylist continues working with his combs until he is satisfied with his client's new look.

The barber is not the first in India to come up with such a radical way of cutting punters' hair.
