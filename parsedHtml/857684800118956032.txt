Mandy Moore has played a Disney princess and now a lovable TV mom, but in June she'll join the great coterie of actresses who have played sexy shark food. In the first trailer, debuted by People, we get a look at the terrifying and awesome deep sea thriller.

In 47 Meters Down, Moore plays Lisa, a young woman fresh from a breakup who goes shark diving in lieu of a more traditional Eat, Pray, Love deal.

47 Meters Down is in theaters June 16.
