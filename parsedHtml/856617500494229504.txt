Glassdoor

If you work at a large consulting or tech firm, you may be among the highest-earning people in the country, according to a new report by Glassdoor. The careers site revealed the best-paying companies by total compensation for 2017. It based the ranking on the wages that Glassdoor users reported over the past year and excluded firms that had less than 50 salary submissions during that period.

This list differs from those that my colleague Karsten Strauss and I have covered recently (here and here) in that it focuses on companies, not jobs. A consequence of that distinction is that, although doctors are among the highest-paid people in the country, no health care companies made this list. Since health care firms often have many moderately paid workers, their total median compensation is lower than that of the organizations in this set.

To view the top 10 highest-paying companies, open the gallery below. For the full list of 25, see the end of this post.

Management consulting firm A.T. Kearney ranked first, just as it did last year. In 2016, total median compensation reached $175,000, growing 4% compared with 2015. The 3,600-person firm helps clients in areas like corporate strategy, analytics, and mergers and acquisitions. Salaries across the company vary widely. Associates make about $163,000 on average, while partners earn $858,000. One partner even reported making $1,220,000.

Strategy&, the strategy consulting arm of professional services giant PwC, came in second, holding onto its same spot from last year. Compensation jumped a noteworthy 8% to $172,000. If you’ve never heard of Strategy&, that’s probably because the company formed just three years ago, after PwC acquired Booz & Company, which had formerly been the oldest operating consultancy in the world. Strategy& has 3,000 employees according to Vault.com.

Palo Alto-based VMware, a business-to-business cloud computing company founded in 1998, ranked third. In 2016, compensation at VMware increased 10%, or about $15,000, to $167,050. According to data from LinkedIn, nearly half of VMware’s current job openings are in engineering and IT, while 17% are in sales.

Facebook made headway against rival Google last year, according to Glassdoor’s data. In 2015, total median compensation at Google was nearly $4,000 higher than at Facebook. But in 2016, Facebook’s median base salary grew by about $3,000, while Google’s decreased by a similar amount. As a result, the two companies in 2016 had nearly identical median compensation of about $155,000, as reported on Glassdoor.
