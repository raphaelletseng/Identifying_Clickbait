Day.'"

UPDATED 11:14 p.m. ET: Biloxi issued a statement quoting Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich at around 11 p.m. in response to the outcry over his city's tweet labeling MLK Day "Great Americans Day." In it, they admitted that earlier statements about how they had not created that name were mistaken.

"The name has since been traced back to a City Council on Dec. 23, 1985 to proclaim the third Monday of every January 'to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other great Americans who have made important contributions to the birth, growth and evolution of this country,'" it explained.

Gilich also said that he wants the City Council to "update the city‚Äôs Code of Ordinances to reflect the official federal name of the holiday, 'Birthday of Dr. Martin Luthern King Jr.,' commonly known as 'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.'"

‚ÄúIn my opinion,‚Äù the mayor said, ‚Äúthat is the appropriate step to take, for the holiday to have the same name as the federal holiday."

Mississippi is one of three states that celebrate Robert E. Lee Day and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day on the same date. Arkansas and Alabama are the others.

Biloxi posted a comment on its Facebook page stating, "The City of Biloxi did not declare nor name this holiday. The holiday was declared and named by the state Legislature. The city, in fact, as it has done for years, touted our upcoming MLK celebration in a Bmail and on the city website this afternoon."

However, one legal sleuth was able to unearth something that certainly looks like the city naming the holiday.

Twitter users were perhaps even more stung because Biloxi is a city in Mississippi, a state where Confederate pride still runs rampant and where a student placed a noose on Ole Miss' James Meredith statue last year. The social network was both bewildered and fed up.
