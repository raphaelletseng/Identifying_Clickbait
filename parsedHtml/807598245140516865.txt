Sarah Gailey serves as a shining example of why men should always listen to their girlfriends.

She tweeted her story, which should be a warning to all:

STORY TIME

Gather round, Twitter, and I shall tell you the tale of instant gross justice — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

I once dated a terrible man who was awful &horrible &I shouldn't have dated him. You know the type. Just picture "awful," that's him. 1/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

One of the horrible things about this man was that he didn't listen to me. Ever. Even if he asked a question, he'd ignore the answer.

One night we were at a family member's house and he spotted something curious lying on the coffee table.

"What's that?" he asked.

3/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

"Don't touch it," I said, even as he reached for the thing on the table.

Did he listen?

What do you think, reader?

4/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

He grabbed it &started to fiddle with it.

"Put that down, you don't want to touch it" I said.

"But what is it?" he asked, still fiddling.

"It's -- put it down, don't touch that button," I said.



What do you imagine he did?



6/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

Reader, he raised the thing in his hand to eye level, looked right at me, and

touched

the

button



7/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

I was trying to save him from himself.

I really was.

But it all happened so fast, there wasn't time for me to explain what the thing was.

Twitter, if y'all have ever watched television, you have probably seen a commercial for

The Ped Egg



9/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

The Ped Egg, for the uninitiated, is a little egg-shaped device. It's hollow.

On the underside, there's a little foot grater.



10/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

You can use the Ped Egg to grate off the crusty, barnacled undersides of your gnarled-up feet. The egg part catches the foot shavings.

11/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

You can really collect a lot of foot shavings if you are a dedicated foot-grater and use your Ped Egg on the daily

as my relative did

12/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

(my apologies to everyone who

If you don't empty your Ped Egg frequently, it can get

*pretty much packed*

with foot shavings

(sorry)

13/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

Back to the story.

My ex raised the thing to eye level, looked at me, and pushed the button.

And the thing in his hand sprang open.

14/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

My relative's foot shavings ERUPTED from within the Ped Egg like an explosion of flesh confetti

"What was that?!" he yelled, frantically slapping at his face, trying to whisk the foot crumbs out of his eyelashes



16/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

I was laughing so hard that I was in very real danger of peeing myself and the only word I managed to choke out was

"feet"

17/ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

THAT is why you ALWAYS listen to your girlfriend. Because if you don't, you end up with a foot in your mouth.

And nose.

And eyes.

~fin~ — Sarah Gailey (@gaileyfrey) December 7, 2016

And Twitter loved it.

@gaileyfrey IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE THINGS WILL BE OKAY



GROSS JERKS WILL CHOKE ON A CLOUD OF BUNION DUST

@gaileyfrey when I die and my life flashes before my eyes, I am hoping that somehow, bonus footage of this wonderful moment is included. — The Kate (@thekate) December 7, 2016

If that's not a warning to never ignore anyone else ever again, I don't know what is.
