Epic Fail: Rachel Maddow Mocked After Dragging Out Trump Tax 'Scoop'
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER MSNBC host Rachel Maddow was widely mocked on social media Tuesday night after drawing out the revelations in what she announced was an “exclusive story” regarding Donald Trump’s tax returns. Instead of getting right to her big scoop about a 2005 Trump tax return she obtained, Maddow opened her show with a rambling 20-minute rant outlining her often tangential theories regarding Trump’s connections to Russia. FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Maddow did not unveil the relevant tax documents until 23 minutes into the show, revealing that Donald Trump had made more than $150 million in income in 2005 and paid $38 million in income taxes that year. In fact, Maddow took so long to get to the point, that the Trump White House scooped her: White House releases Trump tax info ahead of MSNBC report, says he paid $38M in 2005 https://t.co/8TtPu4eCA6  pic.twitter.com/qjyl4p6dPM — The Hill (@thehill) March 15, 2017 So @maddow took so long to get to the news that @realDonaldTrump scooped her. https://t.co/yTwpBHianm — Joel B.
