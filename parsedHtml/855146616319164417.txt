Paris shooting: Police officer dead after incident on Champs-Elysees, reports say

Updated

A policeman has been killed and another wounded in a shooting incident in central Paris, according to a police spokeswoman.

The person who fired on police on the Champs-Elysees, one of the world's most famous streets, has been killed, the source said.

Police authorities called on the public to avoid the area.

Witnesses reported a helicopter flying low over central Paris, apparently part of a follow-up police operation.

France goes to the polls on Sunday in the first round of a closely fought presidential election.

There is still no word on the identity or motivation of the gunman but jihadism has been a major issue in the campaign.

France is still reeling from repeated Islamist terrorist attacks.

More to come.
