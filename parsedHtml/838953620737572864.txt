Internet quickly turns GOP's Obamacare replacement plan into a meme
Internet quickly turns GOP's Obamacare replacement plan into a meme
The Republicans unveiled their healthcare plan on Monday night and it's looking like a weak replacement for Obamacare. It defunds Planned Parenthood, rolls back the Medicaid expansion, restricts abortion , and lets insurers jack up premiums by 30 percent if there's a lapse in coverage. Oh! And there's a big tax cut for CEOs making more than $500,000 and a weirdly specific ban on lottery winners getting Medicaid. SEE ALSO: Cringe-worthy video shows people don't know that Obamacare and ACA are the same thing Needless to say, people were impressed, and they responded with the internet's greatest tool for self-expression: memes.
