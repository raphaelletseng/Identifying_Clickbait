5 NBA Trades We Want to See Before the Deadline
The DeMarcus Cousins trade sent shockwaves through the NBA. Few saw it coming. It's been widely referred to as the worst trade in NBA history. It highlighted the complete ineptitude of the Kings as an organization. And it possibly set the stage for what could be an eventful trade deadline. The out of left field nature of the Cousins trade got us thinking about some of the other transactions we wouldn't mind see go down. Some, we acknowledge, are a little far-fetched. Others, are absolutely rooted in sound logic and would make perfect sense for the clubs and players involved. Regardless, we just hope more craziness goes down for the 3 pm EST deadline approaches Thursday and we're blessed with a bunch of Woj bombs leading up to it.
