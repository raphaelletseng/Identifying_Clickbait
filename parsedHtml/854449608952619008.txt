Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib reportedly will not face any disciplinary action from the NFL following the 2016 incident in which he shot himself in the leg.

On Tuesday, USA Today's Tom Pelissero reported the league has closed its investigation without a fine or suspension. Cameron Wolfe of the Denver Post confirmed the news.

Talib was shot June 5 after leaving a nightclub, and in October, Rebecca Lopez of WFAA reported the Dallas Police Department concluded its investigation into the incident, determining he shot himself.

The NFL continued its investigation under its personal conduct policy, and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported in September that Talib was not likely to face discipline "barring discovery of new evidence."

Talib didn't miss any games during the regular season as a result of the incident and finished the year with three interceptions.
