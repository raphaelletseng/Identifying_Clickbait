Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott was part of a yacht party in Miami that was searched by the United States Coast Guard.

Per TMZ Sports, two guards "boarded the yacht to make sure there were enough life jackets onboard" and left without issuing a citation.

TMZ Sports also captured a short video of the Coast Guard talking to Elliott and searching the yacht:

The site also noted the yacht doesn't belong to Elliott but "a guy who rents 'em out to celebs and other rich folks."

Elliott is coming off a successful rookie season in the NFL. He led the league with 1,631 rushing yards and helped the Cowboys win the NFC East for the second time in three years.
