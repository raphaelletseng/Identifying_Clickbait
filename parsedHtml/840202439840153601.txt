Nicki Minaj isn't in the diss record business. After dropping a trio of new tracks on Thursday night, Nicki explained her Remy Ma response methods in an Instagram caption and reminded us that queens don't work on "peasant time." Instead, they move exclusively on "#QueenTime." "Diss records can't be lies," Nicki wrote. "Great diss records are FACTS. But here @ Young Money, we don't do diss records, we drop HIT RECORDS & diss u ON them [sic]." Later in the caption, Nicki gave Remy a challenge: "Now I got a countdown of my own for Sheneneh. U got 72 hours to drop a hit and I'll give u half a million dollars if u can book ANY show or interview w/o mentioning the Queen name [sic]." #NoFrauds #FactsOnly ft @champagnepapi & @liltunechi #YoungMoneyTilTheDeathOfMe committing perjury #IGotB4andafterPicturesOfYourSurgery #StopSurgeryShamingB4IPostThem #Fraud diss records can't be lies.
