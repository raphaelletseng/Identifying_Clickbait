Bani J Has A Message For People Who Body-Shame Women And It's A Must Read For Everyone!
Bani J Has A Message For People Who Body-Shame Women And It's A Must Read For Everyone! Bani J is one gutsy woman and we have several proofs. Be it her Bigg Boss stint or inspiring us for a fitter and healthier lifestyle, Bani J is a woman worth taking inspiration from. Sadly, people on the internet have time and again stooped too low and body shamed her. Calling her manly for her unique physique, Bani has never let that affect her and we love her for that. Time and again many celebrities have spoken about body shaming and other issues but only some have managed to make sense. Few months ago, Bani took to her social media accounts to shut haters and trolls. You're the only one holding you back, Pulling you in and then pushing yourself away. Building up the walls keeping people out, realisations out, growth out, awareness out - Educate yourself to sense resistance, emotionally unlearn conditioning we've been brought up with Unaware, asleep. Break down the programming, build a system of beliefs for yourself ground up - you'll be surprised to see what you find. Marvel and the weightlessness you will discover without the baggage of gender/ labels / conformation/ settling/ but this is what is expected of me/ I can't do this/ that/ the other/ because *they* said so/ but / but/ what if/ you can't predict the next moment or what you'll BE like tomorrow in that moment standing in front of him/her holding your heart out because guess what? You haven't LIVED that moment yet. Why are we always in such a hurry? Slow it down. Just a gentle reminder to fuck *them* They don't know what makes you happy, what keeps you up at night looking for direction, on a quest for inspiration - don't let up though, keep at it. Keep searching Keep seeking for yourself - WITHIN- yourself. Looking for yourself in someone else... is poetic as fuck, but your questions and answers and the galaxies are all within that beautiful mind and soul of yours. Spend some time with yourself.

Does not mean that *You* have to settle. For anything less than what makes you truly happy and feel in Flow, free and limitless. We need to unlearn so much, about labels/ restrictions/ standards of beauty/ truth/ realness / purpose/ relationships and so much more in order to relearn how to TRULY BE. Start somewhere, anywhere.

Bani said,

‚ÄúI can understand the kind of pressure when you wake up a day and you find yourself fat one day because you are working on a project which is in the limelight. No matter where you are, people are taking pictures of you and they don‚Äôt even think before making comments but the kind of damage it can do, you can‚Äôt imagine that state. It hurts, it really does. I want to make you understand that being such a way is not cool.

I have to say that we women always fall victim to it. We do this (body shaming) to each other, its disgusting. The thing is, we have been conditioned that way that ‚Äòyeh tumhari competition hai, you are threatened by this woman or she will take away your husband from you‚Äô whatever it is, its stupid and we need to grow over it.

Why can‚Äôt I look at you and say that you are beautiful and mean it, rather than thinking ‚Äòyaar yeh sundar toh lag rahi hai but isne kuch toh karaya hoga.‚Äô Can we get over this?‚Äù
