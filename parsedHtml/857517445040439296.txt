North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is a devoted follower of Serie A thanks to the impact his 18-year-old countryman Kwang-Song Han has made at Cagliari.

Italian senator Antonio Razzi recently visited the secretive Asian state, where Kim Jong-Un revealed he has not only been following Kwang-Song Han's progress but the league in general.

Razzi also suggests that Juventus would sell out the 114,000-capacity Rungrado 1st of May Stadium if they ever played in the North Korean capital Pyongyang.

The dictator has been particularly impressed with the form of Cagliari's North Korean striker, Kwang-Son Han, who recently became the first player from the country to score in Serie A

'Does he follow Italian football? Of course, he knows all about Serie A and NBA basketball,' Razzi told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport.

'If Juventus were playing in Pyongyang Stadium, which is huge, it would fill up.'

Razzi now plans to meet up with Cagliari's young star and pass on his compliments from the supreme leader.

'What will I say to Han on Sunday? I'll give him compliments, he is considered a talent at the level of those in Europe,' Razzi said.

Kwang-Song Han became the first North Korean to score in Serie A when he netted in his side's 3-2 loss to Torino back in early April.
