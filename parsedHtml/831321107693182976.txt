Venezuela president to CNN: 'Do not put your nose in Venezuela'


Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro said he does not want CNN operating in his country anymore after the news network published a report that said officials in Venezuela's embassy in Iraq have sold passports and visas to suspected terrorists.

"CNN, do not get into the affairs of Venezuelans," Maduro said Sunday, according to a Fox News report. "I want CNN well away from here. Outside of Venezuela. Do not put your nose in Venezuela."

CNN's report, according to Fox, was aired on CNN en Espanol after a year-long investigation.

Freedom House, a nonprofit that advocates for press freedom around the globe, ranked Venezuela's press freedom status in 2016 as "not free."
