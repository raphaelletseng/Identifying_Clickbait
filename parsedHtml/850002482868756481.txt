How to qualify for the Masters, the world's most prestigious golf tournament


The Masters is the most prestigious golf tournament in the world and most golfers yearn for an invitation.

As it turns out, there are 19Â different ways in which a golfer can come to receive an invitation to the Masters. Many players qualify under multiple criteria, including Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, and Jason Day, who all qualify under seven of the 19 differentÂ categories.

The qualifications are also always changing. For example, the USGA no longer holds the US public links championship where the winner used to receive an invite to the Masters. On the flip side, the Latin American amateur champ is a recent addition, andÂ the reigning Olympic gold medalist is now an automatic qualifier.

Below we take a look at the 19 different ways a golfer can qualify for the Masters and which of this year's 94 golfers qualified under each. The golfers are only listed under their first qualification.
