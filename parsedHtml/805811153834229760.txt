TRUMP: 'I would have far less reason to tweet' if the media covered me 'honorably'


President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Monday that he'd have "far less" of a reason to use Twitter if he received what he believed to be more fair coverage.

"If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to 'tweet,'" Trump tweeted. "Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!"

Trump used the social-media platform to bash NBC's "Saturday Night Live" as "unwatchable" and "totally biased" for a skit in which Alec Baldwin impersonated the Manhattan billionaire and his tweeting habits.

"The Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad!" Trump tweeted.

He also used Twitter recently to defend himself for what he described as a congratulatory from the president of Taiwan. The call, which broke decades of US foreign-policy orthodoxy, was the first communication between the leaders of the two countries since 1979 and risked angering the Chinese government.

As is typically the case when Trump criticizes the media, he did not point out anything that was inaccurately reported but merely sowed doubt about whether the media was being forthcoming regarding its coverage of him.
