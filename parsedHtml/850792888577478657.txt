16 times Ed Miliband was the sassiest politician on Twitter
As a rule, British politicians tend to be fairly stuffy on Twitter. They're so conscious about saying the right thing that they often end up spouting generic statements that don't really say anything at all. SEE ALSO: 23 times Danny Dyer was hands down the funniest British person on Twitter Ed Miliband used to be a bit like that. Back when he was the Labour leader campaigning for the 2015 general election, a typical tweet of his would look something like this: I’m proud to be one of nearly 200,000 Labour Party members. Join us today to help the final push of our campaign: http://t.co/qNFwnf4yFf — Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband) April 27, 2015 Pretty ordinary, right? After the 2015 election was over and he stepped down as Labour leader, though, things changed. The predictable, cautious Ed vanished, and something altogether sassier was unleashed. From self-deprecating jokes to spectacular shutdowns, here are some of Miliband's most badass post-election tweets. 1. The time he put Piers Morgan firmly in his place.
