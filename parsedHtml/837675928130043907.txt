Northwestern Football Players Re-enact Basketball Game-Winner vs. Michigan
Clayton Thorson and Cam Green were so impressed with #ThePass, they tried to recreate it this morning. #B1GCats https://t.co/6FM547Pc6p On Wednesday night, the Northwestern Wildcats defeated the Michigan Wolverines after Nathan Taphorn heaved a full-court dime —a football pass, you might say—to Dererk Pardon, who scored at the buzzer. Perfect pass from @NU_nate32.

#BTNStandout finish from @dererk5.

Monster win by @NUMensBball: https://t.co/oTN8CG8VIl Some fellow Wildcats tried to recreate the play a day later. Only this time, it was quarterback Clayton Thorson and "superback" Cameron Green. As Taphorn and Pardon watched from the stands, the guys from the gridiron struggled to replicate the game-winner. They figured it out eventually when Thorson swapped out a basketball for a pigskin. Northwestern will continue its push toward the NCAA tournament against Purdue this Sunday. [Twitter, h/t Extra Mustard ] Like the new article format? Send us feedback ! Where can I comment?
