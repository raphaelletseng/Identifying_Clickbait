Luis Arnold Lopez-Lara, a 25-year-old illegal immigrant, and 23-year-old Helmer Alexander Erazo allegedly kidnapped the 22-year-old woman with autism after she left her residence after being upset, according to Ozarks First . The woman was reportedly walking past a mobile home when Lopez-Lara and Erazo offered the woman alcohol and told her to come inside. A third man told warned the girl not to listen to the two men. The woman was held against her will for three days, according to the victim, where Lopez-Lara repeatedly sexually assaulted and raped her.

We’ve never had anything like this go on,” Smith continued. “We’ve never felt like we really had to lock our doors, lock our cars and watch our kids at night. Just not the town I grew up in anymore.” Lopez-Lara and Erazo are being charged with kidnapping, sexual assault, rape and the illegal immigrant is facing deportation. Two other Hispanic men who witnessed the kidnapping and sexual assaults are awaiting charges. Lopez-Lara is being held by the Greene County Sheriff’s Office without bond and Erazo is being held on a $150,000 bond.
