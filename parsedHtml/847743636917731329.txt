Remember the photo of Sachin Tendulkar and Sonu Nigam doing the rounds, in which the skipper was holding a mic and the singer a bat? Now we know what the hype was all about.

The Master blaster is all set to make his singing debut alongside Sonu Nigam, and contrary to the rumours, it is not for his biopic Sachin: A Billion Dreams but for his app – 100 MB, which was launched yesterday.

The cricketer revealed about the same during the event, “I have always been fond of music. I never thought I would sing a song. My wife (Anjali) is the brain behind me singing this song. It was her idea. She was the only one who believed I could sing.”
