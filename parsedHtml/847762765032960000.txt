University responds that comments "are his own opinion"

(CNN) A Drexel University professor tweeted that he was "trying not to vomit or yell about Mosul" after he watched a first-class passenger give up his seat for a uniformed soldier on an airplane.

Many on Twitter responded to the professor's comments with anger and outrage.

George Ciccariello, associate professor of politics and global studies, posted the tweet Sunday on his private Twitter account. CNN obtained his tweet from a retweet someone else posted publicly on the social media platform.

One critic said Ciccariello "is exactly what's wrong with American institutions today. Fights for free speech unless it contradicts his views."
