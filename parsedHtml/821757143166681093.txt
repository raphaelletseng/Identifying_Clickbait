With Game of Thrones working its way to a close, it seems likely that we'll be seeing plenty of old faces returning (before being swiftly dispatched of as is the norm with the HBO fantasy series).

Such characters we wouldn't expect to see, however, are the ones that have already been killed off - and the keen-eyed folk over at Watchers on the Wall have noticed one such character will be reappearing.

David Bradley as Walder Frey

Although his backs up previous rumours suggesting he would be showing up again, it should be noted that the website incorrectly claims he appeared in season two as opposed to three).
