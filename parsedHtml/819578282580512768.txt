China's new topsy-turvy bridge actually has three bridges woven into one


A bridge doesn'tÂ need to include the standard, gray concreteÂ beams, cables, and deck. They can twist and turn and pop with color.

That's the philosophyÂ behind the Lucky Knot bridge inÂ Changsha, China, which was designed by Next Architects.Â

Spotted by Designboom, the whimsical pedestrian bridge actually hasÂ three bridges woven into one structure. Next Architects was awarded the project after their design proposal won an international competition in 2013,Â Michel Schreimachers,Â a partner at the firm, tells Business Insider. The steel bridge inÂ Changsha's newly redeveloped city center was completed in late 2016.
