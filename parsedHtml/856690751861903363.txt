Sean Spicer: Trump 'has a heart' on immigration


Perry was castigated for it by GOP voters in that campaign. Mitt Romney seized Perry's immigration comments to halt the Texan's momentum with conservatives. This, in turn, helped Romney win the Republican nomination that year.

Four years later, during the 2016 campaign, Trump said that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was illegal and said that Washington had to prioritize border security. Obama had claimed executive authority to implement DACA after Republicans in Congress declined to approve legislation that would have instituted a similar policy.

But the president appears to have evolved on the issue and embraced Perry's old position. During Monday's White House press briefing, Spicer said that Trump is focused on deporting illegal immigrant criminals but sensitive to breaking up families.

"He's been consistent about two things. One, he's had a heart and wants to make sure he does what's in the interest of children in particular, but secondly, the president's priorities since he took office have been very clear that the focus would be on folks that present a danger to public safety and that's what it's been and that's where it continues to be," Spicer said.

"His comments that he made last week that he understands that in a lot of cases this involves families and small children who've been here, and, he has a heart and we're going to work through the immigration," he added. "The president wants to make sure that he addresses the issue of illegal immigration and all of its components."
