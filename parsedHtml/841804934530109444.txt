Kehlani Cancels European Tour to Undergo Emergency Surgery
The European leg of Kehalni’ s SweetSexySavage tour has been cut short. On Tuesday, the 21-year-old singer announced she was canceling the remaining dates to undergo emergency hernia surgery. She shared the news via Instagram, with a close-up shot of her abdomen. Hey guys... I've enjoyed being on the road in Europe so so much these past weeks. I'm deeply saddened to announce that I have to fly home for sudden unexpected surgery on my stomach, as some of you know I have a hernia (that squishy ball thingy above my belly button) and it's gotten to a point if necessary surgery. I'm going to have to reschedule the rest of my European tour in order to get it done and heal up. thank you for all of your support. I love you guys... 😪💛 A post shared by Kehlani (@kehlani) on Mar 14, 2017 at 4:47am PDT “[A]s some of you know I have a hernia (that squishy ball thingy above my belly button) and it's gotten to a point [of] necessary surgery,” Kehlani wrote. “I'm going to have to reschedule the rest of my European tour in order to get it done and heal up.” Though there is no word on the new tour dates, the singer did promise to refund fans who were affected by the cancelations. yes we will refund and reschedule, taking care of this is most important right now.
