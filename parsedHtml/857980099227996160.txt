Hereâs every law Trump has signed in his first 100 days


The Trump administration has been touting the president'sÂ achievements as he nears the 100-day mark on Saturday, April 29.Â

In anticipation, the White House released aÂ statement on Tuesday praising theÂ president for signing a "slew" of legislation, "despite historic Democratic obstructionism."Â Republicans control both houses of Congress.Â

"President Trump has worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman," the statement said, noting that former president Barack Obama enacted 11 laws during his first 100 days.

While Trump has signed 28 congressional actions since taking office, none are major pieces of legislation. Slightly under half are rollbacks of Obama-era regulations.Â By contrast, Obama signed the stimulus package into law before his 100th day.
