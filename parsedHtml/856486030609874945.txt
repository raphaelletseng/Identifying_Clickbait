Jimmy Butler Rips Marcus Smart for 'Acting Tough' With Him: 'He's Not About That Life'
Jimmy Butler Rips Marcus Smart for 'Acting Tough' With Him: 'He's Not About That Life'
The post-game interviews following NBA playoff games this season have been entertaining to say the least. From Grizzlies coach David Fizdaleâ€™s now-legendary "Take that for data!" rant last week to Russell Westbrook â€™s verbal altercation with an Oklahoma City columnist following a game on Sunday night, there has been no shortage of fireworks during post-game press conferences during the first round of the 2017 NBA Playoffs. Bulls star Jimmy Butler added to them on Sunday night after Chicagoâ€™s loss to the Celtics. During Game 4 of the Bulls/Celtics series, Butler and Boston guard Marcus Smart were involved in a confrontation on the court after Smart shoved Butler. Words were exchanged between the two players and tensions were high between the two teams.

While speaking with reporters after the game, he referred to Smart as a "great actor" and went as far as to say that he doesnâ€™t think Smart is "about that life." He suggested that Smart not get into it with him again when the Bulls and Celtics play Game 5 on Wednesday.

"And Iâ€™m the wrong guy to get in my face. So he needs to take it somewhere else because Iâ€™m not the one for thatâ€¦Weâ€™re not gonna sit here and get in each otherâ€™s faces. Like I said, heâ€™s not about that life. Calm it down." Will Smart listen to Butler? Ha. Oh, heâ€™ll hear what he said. But we wouldnâ€™t expect him to actually take Butlerâ€™s advice, and if anything, itâ€™ll only make Game 5 that much more intense.
