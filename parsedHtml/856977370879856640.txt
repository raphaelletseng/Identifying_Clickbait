It's part of a growing trend.

What defines the trend is its near-onomatopoeic language, popularised by subreddits like r/aww and r/RarePuppers, and, well, videos like this:

For instance:

Floof = Fluff

Mlem = Dog lick

Bork = Bark

Boop = Pressing/gently poking a dog's nose

Pupper = Puppy

Fren = Friend

Gud Boi = Good Boy

Gud Grill = Good Girl

Doggo = Dog

In addition, you get more advanced terminology, such as a blop:

A blop is when a dog pokes his tongue out due to tiredness/forgetfulness and it often is only a small portion of the tongue. A mlem is basically any time a dog is licking their chops, or sticking their tongue out!

Also you need to intersperse and drastically overuse the word "heck".
