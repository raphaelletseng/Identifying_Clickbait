Mr Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress is expected to be closely scrutinised by traders, for more detail on his plans to boost economic growth.

In an overnight meeting with state governors, the President said his administration would be moving quickly on regulatory reforms.

Shares in defence companies - including Boeing, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin - gained value overnight, after Mr Trump said he would seek to boost Pentagon spending by $US54 billion in his first budget proposal.

NAB's director of economics David de Garis wrote an economic note suggesting Mr Trump's details need to match his promises.

"He is saying that there is going to be a 'massive' boost to the military but, even here, will the impact of this boost on the budget bottom line - in the order of a 10 per cent defence boost - be totally neutralised by ambitious cuts elsewhere?" he wrote.

"According to administration officials, the defence boost will come with offsetting budget cuts, but not apparently to entitlement programs (two-thirds of the budget).

"This means cuts among discretionary spending programs will be required to the tune of an ambitious 10 per cent, a big number.

"There are still lots of uncertainties about policies and processes.

"It still has a strong pro-growth tilt and intention, but the details are all important."

In economic news, US durable goods orders rose by 1.8 per cent in January, beating analyst's estimates for a 1.6 per cent increase.

The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing survey also bettered expectations, rising from 22.1 to 24.5.

Predictions were for a reading of just 19.4.

However, pending home sales were down 2.8 per cent in January, against expectations of a 0.6 per cent rise.

European markets added value largely owing to some positive earnings updates.

However, motor insurance companies came under pressure after a regulatory change that could lead to higher pay-outs.

The UK Government made a reduction to a rate which discounts certain large motor claims.

The Ministry of Justice cut the discount rate to -0.75 per cent from 2.5 per cent.

Locally, it is set to be a fairly subdued open, with the ASX SPI 200 up 0.1 per cent to 5,701 at 8:15am (AEDT).

At the same time, the Australian dollar was worth 76.73 US cents, having gained a bit of ground overnight.

West Texas crude oil was slightly higher at $US53.99 a barrel, the price of a barrel of Tapis was lower at $US56.74 and spot gold had slipped to $US1,251.81 an ounce.
