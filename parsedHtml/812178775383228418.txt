German police arrest two men suspected of planning shopping mall attack

Updated

Germany's special forces have arrested two men suspected of planning an attack on the Centro shopping mall in Oberhausen in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, police said.

The suspects, two brothers aged 28 and 31 who were born in Kosovo, were arrested in the city of Duisburg after information provided by security sources, police said in a statement.

Police are now probing what the pair's intentions were and whether anyone else was involved.

Police said in a statement that they increased their presence at Centro and a nearby Christmas market on Thursday evening after receiving a tip from "security sources".

Officers in uniform and plain clothes patrolled the area, but the mall remained open.

Centro is one of Germany's biggest malls, with more than 250 shops.

There was no indication of any connection between the detentions and Monday's truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 people.

Police are searching for a Tunisian suspect whose fingerprints were found inside the truck.

The suspect's brother has appealed for him to surrender to police, as authorities across Europe continue a continent-wide manhunt.

The Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Breitscheidplatz market has since reopened to visitors, guarded by heavily armed police.
