Meet Bernardo Almonte, a 19-year-old from New Jersey, and his girlfriend, Melissa Vazquez. The pair have dated for over a year. “We like to joke around and play around,” Almonte told BuzzFeed News. On Monday, Almonte’s biology class was told to draw and label the ~parts~ of different animals. He was supposed to draw a spider. Here’s how it turned out: Wow. According to Almonte, his classmates and professor laughed at his drawing. His girlfriend dragged him on Twitter, asking for prayers. “As soon as I saw it I knew I had to share it because I knew I wasn’t the only one who would find his drawing funny,” she said.
