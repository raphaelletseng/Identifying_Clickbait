Brody was present for the game behind the scenes, and he was ecstatic to be the ball boy. You might also remember this video of Brody working on his dribbling while undergoing treatment at the hospital. It was after that video surfaced that Curry paid him a visit.

We had a great time." Especially after seeing this photo, it's clear that not only did both leave a lasting impression on each other but also this has grown into a wonderful friendship.
