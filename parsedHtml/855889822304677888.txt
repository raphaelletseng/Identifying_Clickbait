Dwyane Wade's Son, Nephew Put Together Highlight Reel at Chicago High School
As Dwyane Wade looks to lead the Chicago Bulls to a first-round playoff upset of the Boston Celtics, his son, Zaire Wade, and nephew, Dahveon Morris, are following in the NBA star's footsteps. Zaire Wade and Morris are teammates at Mount Carmel High School in Chicago. As shown above, the teenage duo is putting on a clinic. Last month, Jimmy Butler touted the younger Wade's perseverance and confidence to For The Win's Alysha Tsuji . "The kid [Zaire], he's always in the gym working on his game," Butler said. "But … when he makes it to the league, every single NBA player is going to try to score 50 on him because he will talk trash to any player at any time no matter what. And I love him for it." Butler using "when" rather than "if" was a strong endorsement of his Chicago Bulls teammate's son. [ Ballislife Midwest ]
