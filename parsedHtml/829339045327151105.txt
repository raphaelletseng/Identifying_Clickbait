Lady Gaga wasn't having it when she caught wind of some haters trying to body shame her for how she looked during her spectacularÂ Super Bowl LI halftime performance . Reacting to a string of tweets on Sunday night (Feb. 5) claiming she had a "muffin top" or "beer gut," the singer shut it down. "I'm proud of my body and you should be proud of yours too," she wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday (Feb. 7). Gaga, 30Â -- who has spent years fighting against bullying and encouraging her Little Monsters to love themselves just the way they are through her Born This Way Foundation -- said she caught wind of the fact that her body has become a topic of conversation and sought to encourage her fans to tune out the noise.  "No matter who you are or what you do. I could give a million reasons why you don't need to cater to anyone or anything to succeed," she said. "Be you, and be relentlessly you." I heard my body is a topic of conversation so I wanted to say, I'm proud of my body and you should be proud of yours too. No matter who you are or what you do. I could give you a million reasons why you don't need to cater to anyone or anything to succeed. Be you, and be relentlessly you. That's the stuff of champions. thank you so much everyone for supporting me. I love you guys. Xoxo, gaga A photo posted by xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) on Â Little Monsters weren't having it either, with a number backing up the singer on Twitter. Lady Gaga jumped from a stadium roof, nailed acrobatics, sang live while dancing for 13 mins, spreaded kindness, but no. BODY FUCKING SHAME! I'm annoyed & disgusted that people would comment negatively about @ ladygaga 's body after her Super Bowl performance. Her bod is rockin. If people actually think Lady Gaga was "fat" at the Super Bowl, I want to be fat. Either way, Gaga is getting the last laugh, as her U.K. and U.S. sales have exploded since Sunday's gig, which FOX reported pulled in anÂ astounding 117.5 million viewers, making it the second-most-viewed halftime show in Super Bowl history, behind Katy Perry's set at SuperÂ XLIX, which drew 120.7 million viewers.
