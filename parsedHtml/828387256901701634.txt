5 Things That Could Decide Super Bowl LI
5 Things That Could Decide Super Bowl LI
Brady was near flawless this season, throwing 28 touchdowns and just two interceptions. But he matched that interception total in the AFC Divisional round against Houston, when the Texans’ elite pass rushers forced him into hairy situations. That makes Vic Beasley arguably the most important player in the game for the Falcons. Beasley led the NFL with 15.5 sacks, and New England’s linemen will need to smother him if they don’t want their quarterback becoming friendly with the ground at NRG Stadium.             It’s inevitable the Falcons will move the ball. So the Patriots’ best hope is that when Atlanta gets into scoring position, the drive ends in a field goal. The Falcons were the only team that averaged more than three points per possession. This was due to Matt Ryan’s absurd efficiency in the red zone—he threw 22 touchdowns and zero interceptions when inside the 20. But New England’s defense was one of the best in these situations, holding opponents to 4.6 points per red zone possession, sixth best.          It’s no secret that Julian Edelman is Brady’s favorite weapon. But Chris Hogan is Brady’s best bet to stretch the field for big gains. He averaged 17.9 yards per catch—far more than Edelman’s 11.3, and only bested on the team by tight end Rob Gronkowski, who suffered a season-ending injury. Eleven of Hogan’s 38 catches during the regular season went for at least 20 yards.          Both of Atlanta’s running backs, Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman, present matchup nightmares for opposing defenses. They’re strong enough to plough through smaller defenders but fast enough to catch passes and outrun linebackers. Coleman is especially dynamic in the passing game. If the Patriots treat him as an afterthought, his speed could torch them. But focusing too much on him only leaves more room for Atlanta’s dynamic receivers to get open.
