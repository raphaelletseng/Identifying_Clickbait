Tweet Hilariously Turns Asian Stereotype On Its Head
Here’s a tweet that’ll have every Asian saying “yaaaas.” Twitter user Helen Hou-Sandí just shut the Twitter game down in response to the racist belief that all Asians look alike. She shared a photo from a recent segment of “ Anderson Cooper 360 ” that features Cooper, CNN counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd and former U.S. army officer Mark Hertling. Yeah, sure, it's Asians who all look same. pic.twitter.com/dxG2UvdJPj Yup, *mic drop.* The tweet went viral with thousands of retweets , and even received a like from Ellen Pao, former interim CEO of Reddit. So far people who are unamused are pretty evenly split between "get back to being a model minority" and "BUT ANDERSON COOPER". Though many Asians across social media rejoiced at the tweet, not everyone was thrilled. Hou-Sandí received messages from people arguing that “ Asians look way more alike ” and even accusing her of being racist. And now we have entered the phase where white people cry "racist!" 🙃🙃🙃 Tweets >>>>>>>> facts. Just in case you needed a reminder, reverse racism doesn’t exist . Don’t even try it. So Helen, keep on keepin’ on. Because that tweet slayed. In case you’re curious, the screenshot appears in the segment below: MORE:
