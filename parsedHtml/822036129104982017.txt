Super Mario Run is coming to Android devices
Super Mario's smartphone adventure is going beyond iPhones and iPads. Nintendo has announced that its mobile game Super Mario Run will arrive on Android devices in March.

It charged to the top of the App Store charts and set a new record of 40 million downloads in four days.

But Nintendo's share price fell sharply after the release of the game, which received a lot of negative reviews from users. Many people, who thought they were downloading a free game, were peeved by the steep fee to go beyond Mario's initial three levels.

Super Mario Run has slipped out of the 25 top grossing mobile games in the U.S., according to analytics firms App Annie and Sensor Tower.
