Economists at Westpac circulated a morning note, saying the Dow's milestone was inevitable, with US markets climbing steadily after Mr Trump won power in November.

"The rise in stocks continues the larger rally that has been in place since Trump's US election victory, built around the promise of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation," the note said.

The Dow reached 19,000 on November 22 and took just over two months to add a further 1,000 points to reach the landmark 20,000 threshold.
