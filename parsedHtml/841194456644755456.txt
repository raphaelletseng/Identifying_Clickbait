Four Players to Watch in the N.C.A.A. Tournament
Four Players to Watch in the N.C.A.A. Tournament
When Kris Jenkins attended the ESPY Awards in July, the former N.B.A. sharpshooter Robert Horry made a point of coming over to share a moment. “I just want to shake the hand of the guy who made the biggest shot I’ve ever seen,” Horry told Jenkins, whose 3-pointer at the buzzer delivered Villanova’s national championship last season. Interactive Graphic Printable N.C.A.A. Tournament Bracket Villanova, Kansas, North Carolina and Gonzaga are the top seeds in the field. Jenkins fumbled out a quick thank you. But in reality, as he stood before Horry — a player so renowned for buzzer-beaters that he came to be known as Big Shot Rob — the 6-foot-6 Jenkins was thinking, “Is he serious?” “Some of the shots that he’s hit,” Jenkins said, “and he’s going to say that to me?” Jenkins’s shot against North Carolina led to many things: magazine covers, television appearances, a visit with President Barack Obama at the White House. But as he heads into his final N.C.A.A. tournament this week with Villanova, the No. 1 seed in the East Region, no one knows better than Jenkins that his title-winning shot needs to stay in the past. Advertisement “Honestly,” he said, “I don’t really talk too much about ‘The Shot,’ other than when I get asked about it.” Advertisement That is part of a teamwide strategy that Coach Jay Wright and his staff have employed to keep their team focused on what it can do, not what some of them have done. Jenkins averaged 13.4 points and 4.2 rebounds during the season, comparable to his numbers from a year ago. But even though this year’s team lost point guard Ryan Arcidiacono and center Daniel Ochefu, the Wildcats did not miss a beat. Unlike some other national championship contenders, Villanova does not have a single projected one-and-done player on its roster. Advertisement And while no team has won consecutive N.C.A.A. championships since Florida in 2006-7, Jenkins and Villanova have as realistic a shot as anyone since then. They finished the regular season 28-3, winning their fourth Big East regular-season championship, and then defeated Creighton, 74-60, to claim the conference tournament title. The ending, as it was last year, is up to them. Last month, a Los Angeles-area basketball player scored 92 points in a game. But neither LaMelo Ball, that sophomore at Chino Hills High School, nor his older brother LiAngelo Ball, a senior there who scored 72 points in a game earlier this season, is the best player in that aptly named family. As of now, that honor goes to the oldest brother of the three, Lonzo Ball, who could lead U.C.L.A. to its first national championship since 1995 — and only the second since John Wooden retired as coach — before almost certainly being taken with a lottery pick in this year’s N.B.A. draft . Advertisement Lonzo Ball, the freshman point guard for the Bruins (29-4), the third seed in the South region, is like a taller Steve Nash. He runs — runs is the operative word — the Bruins’ astonishing offense, among the fastest and most efficient in Division I. U.C.L.A. boasts the most points per game (90.4) as well as the highest field-goal percentage (51.9) and effective field-goal percentage (59.5) in Division I. Ball has the most assists per game (7.7), and he averaged nearly 15 points in less than 35 minutes a contest. But if an evolutionary Nash seems like Ball’s ceiling, he has drawn some comparisons to a more current N.B.A. superstar: Stephen Curry. Ball, like Curry, plays with flash and creativity and has an unorthodox shooting motion. Ball makes more than four of every 10 3-point attempts, and some of these seem to be launched from Santa Monica, Calif., even as they land in Westwood. Advertisement Asked last month whether U.C.L.A. Coach Steve Alford ever chastised Ball for his shots of 25-plus feet, Ball said Alford did not, and added, “Any time you have your coach not putting any chains on you, it helps tremendously.” Advertisement Ball might be used to a long leash from the coach: Until he reached high school, he and his brothers played almost exclusively on teams coached by their father, LaVar. And so enamored is LaVar Ball of his oldest son that last month, he told TMZ that he believed, as of right then, that Lonzo was Curry’s basketball superior. Advertisement Reaction to the proud father’s remark was predictably contemptuous. Lonzo Ball is no Steph Curry. He is, however, Lonzo Ball. In this year’s tournament, that may be enough. At college basketball’s most elite programs, rosters are defined by transience, with the most talented players, beginning with freshmen, leaving years before they might have in an earlier era. (Back then, some would have skipped college altogether.) If a tandem of extremely talented players competes together for even two seasons, that now counts as a veteran lineup. Advertisement In contemporary college basketball terms, then, Kansas (28-4), the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region, has veritable old pros at the guard position in Frank Mason III, a senior, and Devonte’ Graham, a junior. Mason and Graham have started about 60 games together. They were together midway through last season, when the Jayhawks beat then-second-ranked Oklahoma in triple overtime, and at the beginning of this season, when Kansas lost at Indiana in overtime; last year, when the Jayhawks won the Big 12 tournament; and this year, when they bowed out in their first game. Mason and Graham even have N.C.A.A. tournament time together — lost to the eventual champion, Villanova, last year in the round of 8. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mason, the Big 12 player of the year and a leading candidate for national player of the year, is the Jayhawks’ top scorer, at 20.8 points a game. “It’s like we’re playing with two points at all times,” said their coach, Bill Self, referring to the primary ballhandler, “which I think is a good formula for success.” From the outside, the two players appear to be a yin and yang when it comes to personality: Mason, the older player, is somber; Graham is puckish. After a tight win over Baylor at Allen Fieldhouse last month, the two were asked if they felt they had a good rapport. “What’s rapport?” Graham asked with a smile as Mason sat stone-faced. The definition was explained to Graham, and he answered in the affirmative: “Being together over these three years, we just know where we want the ball, when to find each other, pitch in a hand, everything like that.” Advertisement He added, “So I think we’ve got a real good rapport.” Graham laughed heartily. Even Mason could not help smiling. Przemek Karnowski is listed at 7 feet 1 and 300 pounds and — and unless you, too, are a world-class athlete — he is probably faster than you are. Karnowski, Gonzaga’s redshirt senior who hails from Poland, can be seen finishing, or sometimes even leading, the fast break for the Bulldogs (32-1), who were one upset by Brigham Young away from an undefeated regular season. Advertisement Last year might have been the year that it all came together for Karnowski and Gonzaga, except that a back ailment limited, and then prematurely ended, his season. Then the Bulldogs star Kyle Wiltjer graduated and the big man Domantas Sabonis left, selected No. 11 over all in the N.B.A. draft. Karnowski, granted a medical redshirt, elected to use his extra season of eligibility to return. And Gonzaga, which made it to last year’s round of 16, got even better. The adjusted efficiency rankings at KenPom.com list the Bulldogs as the country’s best team, scoring a 10th-best 120 points per 100 possessions and allowing a second-best 88. In addition to subjecting their West Coast Conference rivals to ritual humiliation, they beat several major-conference tournament teams (Arizona, Florida and Iowa State) at neutral sites — just the kind of venues at which N.C.A.A. tournament games are played. Advertisement If Nigel Williams-Goss, a junior who transferred to Gonzaga after two seasons at Washington, is the team’s traditional star — its leader in points, assists and minutes — Karnowski is his team’s identity, the Euro-style big man who can handle the ball and dish out assists along with scoring down low and playing post defense. Gonzaga has dined out on transfers and foreign players for a while now. In Karnowski’s case, the assistant coach Tommy Lloyd came to Europe and watched him play for Poland’s under-17 team, a move that earned Karnowski’s attention, and appreciation, as he piled up the frequent-flier miles. Gonzaga’s flex offense, designed to create mismatches, had obvious appeal to Karnowski, who is not only a walking mismatch because of his size, but a player whose court vision, a skill rare and prized in big men, makes him a natural fit. And then there is his speed. A smaller opposing player will not want to let Karnowski beat him down the court, of course. But it also could be worse: Getting in his way is most likely even more painful, in every sense of the word. An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of a former Gonzaga player. He is Kyle Wiltjer, not Witljer. A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2017, on Page D2 of the with the headline: Four Players to Watch in the N.C.A.A. Tournament.
