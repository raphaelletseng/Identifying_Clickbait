Migrants smash up German asylum centre and injure police


A German police officer has been severely injured in a weekend riot by drunken refugees armed with iron bars who smashed their accommodation centre to smithereens.

Two men from Togo and six from Ghana went berserk at their asylum home in Rees-Haldern, near the Dutch border a DAY after moving in because they were 'unhappy' with their quarters.

They complained there was no mobile phone reception in the building's reception area.

Two dozen armed police had to respond to emergency calls from staff at the centre as the men aged between 18 and 28 laid waste to furniture, windows, doors and fittings. They even tried to penetrate the security room where guards were forced to barricade themselves in for their own safety.

The injured police officer suffered a 'complicated' break in one foot, although whether this was the result of a blow from one of the migrants is unclear.

After the Saturday night riot all eight men were arrested and are now awaiting trial on charges of a serious breach of the peace, criminal damage, resisting arrest, causing actual bodily harm and property damage.

Police said the refugees went into the nearby village from their accommodation on Saturday on a drinking bender.

German police reported last year that they have had to turn out hundreds of times to accommodation centres for refugees when infighting turned violent.
