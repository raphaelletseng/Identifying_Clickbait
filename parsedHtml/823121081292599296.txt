Key points: Police spotted man who was wanted for recent offending in town

To avoid arrest, man waded into water and swam into beach

Police believe man drowned, will prepare report for coroner

Ceduna police noticed the man who was wanted for recent offending in town and began chasing him on foot along the beach.

To avoid arrest, the man waded into water at the end of Dowling Crescent just after 6:00pm on Saturday night.

Acting Superintendent Kevin Lawton said it was a tragedy for all involved.

"Police called out to him from the shore which included using the PA system on the police vehicle, but he continued to walk out into the water," Superintendent Lawton said.

"When he was about 300 metres from the shoreline police lost sight of the man.

"It is unfortunate that during the police officers' routine business this man has made a decision with tragic consequences."

Police launched a water search using local SES and National Parks and Wildlife boats but could not find the man.

The search resumed on Sunday morning, with Water Operations police flying to Ceduna to help.

The man's body was retrieved from the water just after 8:30am and taken to the Ceduna hospital.

Police said the man was from interstate but would not disclose the nature of the crimes he was wanted for.

Police said they believed the man had drowned but would prepare a report for the coroner.
