BBC News NI has tracked down a serial child sex abuser who admitted his crimes to police but has never been brought to justice.

Henry Clarke, 75, confessed to abusing three different boys at care homes in Northern Ireland.

A retired church pastor, he has been living in Canada since he made the admissions in 1985.

Northern Ireland's Director of Public Prosecutions and the RUC failed to act on his confessions.

Today he lives in a small town hundreds of miles from the nearest city in northern Canada.

One of his victims, Billy Brown, 61, who was abused when he was a 12 year-old boy, described Henry Clarke as "a monster".

Mr Brown, who has waived his right to anonymity, said: "You just had to stay away from him. You went to bed at night, you pulled your blankets around you as tightly as you could."

Henry Clarke emigrated to Canada in the late seventies but he eventually admitted the accusations of abuse at during an interview with police in Belfast in 1985 and afterwards in a letter he wrote from Canada.

Clarke was pastor of four churches in Canada after he emigrated.

Henry Clarke's confessions first came to light at the Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) inquiry which reported earlier this year.

His identity had been protected by the inquiry's offer of blanket anonymity but that ruling was successfully challenged by BBC News NI.
