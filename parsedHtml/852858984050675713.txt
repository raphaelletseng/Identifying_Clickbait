Students speak out against Antony Gormley 'suicide' statue placed on roof of their library
tudents have spoken out after their university placed a statue on the edge of the library roof, making it look like it is about to commit suicide. The statue, at the University of East Anglia, is by artist Antony Gormley and has reportedly been mistaken by some students for a real person. A spokesman for UEA defended the work and told the Eastern Daily Press that the statues were “thought-provoking and offer both spectacle and surprise”. One shocked student wrote on Instagram: "Is this some sort of sick joke?" @DrEsmee Love his work, & it fits with our other sculptures, but I think it's potentially a poor choice, especially at dissertation crunch time... A lecturer tweeted: "Love his work, & it fits with our other sculptures, but I think it's potentially a poor choice, especially at dissertation crunch time..."  oh uea #isthissomekindofsickjoke? A post shared by Hazel Hughes (@hazelteapot) on UEA Graduate Kimberley Davies, 22, told the EDP: “It’s a bit tactless to put a statue on top of a building filled with people on edge during exam season. “Sombreros are a no-no, but making passers-by think someone’s about to commit suicide is art – I’m out.” imee tweeted: “No offence UEA, but putting a statue of a human on top of a high building is probably not a good idea??”  🕴 A post shared by @eastanglianwonders on spokesman for UEA said: “The Another Time series involves sculptures being placed at different focal points and sightlines, including roof level which are thought provoking and offer both spectacle and surprise. “The locations were chosen in response to the remarkable architecture of the Sir Denys Lasdun university buildings. All staff and students have been made aware of the new art installation on campus, and where the sculptures will be located.” ntony Gormley is a British sculptor who is best know for creating the Angel of the North.
