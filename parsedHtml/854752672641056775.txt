Martin Shkreli Wins Ruling Splitting Fraud Trial From Ex-Lawyer
Martin Shkreli arrives at federal court in Brooklyn, New York, on July 14, 2016. Martin Shkreli, who faces federal charges that he defrauded investors in hedge funds he ran, won a significant tactical victory as a federal judge ruled that his criminal trial will be separate from his ex-lawyers. The ruling Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn, New York, will enable Shkreli to blame his former lawyer for engineering a securities fraud that cost investors millions of dollars. The trial is scheduled for June 26. Shkreli and his ex-lawyer, Evan Greebel, deny wrongdoing in the case.
