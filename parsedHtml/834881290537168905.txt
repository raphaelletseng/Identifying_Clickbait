Dulles Airport soars to 77 degrees, crushing previous record high

The mercury shot up to 77 degrees at Dulles International Airport just before 4 p.m. Thursday, shattering the record high for the date of 73 set in 1985. Capital Weather Gang’s Ian Livingston points out it is the second warmest temperature ever observed in February at Dulles (records go back to 1963).  The airport came very near to its highest February temperature ever observed of 79 degrees (in 1985 and 2000). Temperatures this warm aren’t normal in the region until mid-May. Neighboring weather stations were also abnormally warm, but not quite at record levels. Reagan National Airport hit 75 degrees while Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport posted 77. The record at those two airports is 78 from 1874. The Washington-Baltimore region joins many others in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast where temperatures were at or not far off records. Here are some of the select records set so far: Albany hit at least 69 degrees, breaking its all-time February high temperature record. Boston hit at least 68 degrees, breaking the previous daily record of 65 from 1990 and tying its second warmest February day on record . Burlington, Vt., hit at least 62 degrees, breaking its all-time February high temperature record . Toronto (Canada), hit 63 degrees, breaking its all-time February high temperature record . Remarkably, temperatures in the Washington-Baltimore area may be just as warm if not warmer on Friday. If National Airport’s temperature rises to 78 degrees, which is a possibility, it would rank among the top five warmest February days on record in Washington.
