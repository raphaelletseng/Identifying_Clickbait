Guy Doing Handstand Push-Ups on Stack of Dumbbells Is Latest Person to Film Super-Dangerous Gym Stunt
At some point recently, some guy thought it'd be a great idea to stack nine dumbbells on top of one another so he could pound out some handstand push-ups. This won't give him any sort of better pump, but it did get him on a bunch of websites. Unfortunately, the internet opted not to focus on his display of pointless athleticism, instead focusing on the more useful athleticism of the elderly man in the background sinking free-throw after free-throw after free-throw. Oh well, every once in awhile a plan backfires. Here's a bunch of other people who risked major injury and/or death to try and entertain you for about five seconds before you click on something else and forget all about them.
