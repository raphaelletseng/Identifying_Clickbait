Paralysed Waist Down, Bandra Man Swims To Cover 8-Km Distance In 4 Hours!
Paralysed Waist Down, Bandra Man Swims To Cover 8-Km Distance In 4 Hours! Nearly six years ago, Bandra resident Mohammad Shams Aalam Shaikh's life centred around karate. A black belt holder and a qualified coach with over 40 gold medals to his credit, the mechancial engineer enjoyed a carefree life. Till he was diagnosed with a tumour in his spine. Numerous surgeries later, his lower body was paralysed. On Saturday, he braved the sea and his immobility at Candolim beach in Goa to break his own record for the longest open sea swimming by a paraplegic. It was a test of endurance for this 30-year-old, who swam 8km on the seas along the Sinquerim-Baga-Candolim belt in 4hours and 4 minutes. "I expected to complete the distance in two or two-and-half hours, but I had to swim against a very strong tide for a larger part of the course," said Shaikh, who used the break between his MBA final exams to come to Goa to achieve the feat. "I want to prove that it is possible for persons with disabilities and spinal cord injuri es to push themselves beyond their limits," he said, adding that he would apply for the Limca Book of World Records, Asian Book of Records and the Guinness World Records. "I was assessed with 100% disability in 2012. I didn't even have control over passing urine. Swimming the butterfly helped me a lot and today I don't need a catheter to relieve myself. This is a huge achievement for me and I was assessed as having 72% disability during the latest review, all because of swimming," he told TOI on the sidelines of the firstever wheelchair accessible beach festival being held on Candolim beach. It was swimming that helped him overcome depression and improve his mobility. "People with disabilities should motivate themselves to come out of their homes, but for this we need the government's support to make spaces, buildings and transportation accessible," he said. Shaikh is now gearing up for the 2018 Asian Games and is hoping to find the right coach to train him for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.
