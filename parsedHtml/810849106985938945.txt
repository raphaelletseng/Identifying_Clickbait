Obama Has Refused to Deport 820,000 Illegal Immigrants Guilty of Murder, Rape, Drug Offenses, and Other Crimes
Obama Has Refused to Deport 820,000 Illegal Immigrants Guilty of Murder, Rape, Drug Offenses, and Other Crimes - Breitbart
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER A new report estimates that there are up to 820,000 illegal aliens in the U.S. who have escaped deportation under Obama’s regime despite that many of them have been convicted of serious crimes including murder, rape, drug offenses, and other crimes. While some estimates say there are up to 2 million criminal illegal aliens in the U.S., a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies finds there are at least 820,000 which, as the Washington Examiner’s Paul Bedard notes, is still larger than the populations of four states: Alaska, North Dakota, Vermont, or Wyoming. FOR OUR NEWSLETTER The study finds that as many as 690,000 of the 820,000 have very serious convictions, while the others have lesser crimes to their record. Bedard also quotes CIS fellow David North who discounts dividing the illegal immigrants into separate categories based on lesser or greater crimes saying, “an illegal alien with a shoplifting record, for example, is an illegal alien who does not belong here in the first place.” During his last four years in office, the number of illegal immigrants Obama deported plunged from his first term. In fact, during 2015, the number of deportations have cratered even over those of 2014 and measured in at his lowest number thus far in his presidency. According to numbers supplied by the Department of Homeland Security, Obama deported 333,000 illegal immigrants (of which 140,000 were convicted of various crimes) in 2015 which is less than the 414,000 from 2014 (with 168,000 those being convicted of major crimes). The 2015 number is his lowest since the 382,000 deported in 2010. Indeed Obama’s 2015 stats are the lowest since 2007, according to Pew Research.
