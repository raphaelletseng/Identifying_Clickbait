Amazingly, Donald Trump still doesn't know how to shake a hand
Donald Trump may be an expert at tweeting, but he hasn't the faintest idea how to shake someone's hand. The latest champion to endure one of the infamously awkward, uncomfortable and visibly aggressive Trump shakes? The Prime Minister of Japan, Shinz≈ç Abe. We feel for you, man. SEE ALSO: Donald Trump is absolutely terrible at  handshakes On Friday morning Abe met with President Trump at the White House, but before the leaders parted ways ... it happened. As the two sat before the cameras, Trump lunged for the prime minister's hand, and before Abe knew what hit him, he was trapped in an absurdly lengthy palm embrace. Relive the cringeworthy shake, pat, hold, shake, shake, shake, pull, pat, shake madness for yourself: pic.twitter.com/OwhUaslnWJ ‚Äî Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 10, 2017 After what seemed like an eternity, Trump finally released his grasp on the prime minister, and Abe (along with all of Japan) breathed a sigh of relief. Abe's face and eye roll spoke volumes, and he looked like he just wanted to get the heck out of there. Trump, completely unfazed, gives two thumbs up.
