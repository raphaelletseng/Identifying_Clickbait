The twins were separated in a 20-hour procedure at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx on Oct. 13 and 14. They left the New York City hospital that had been their home since February, transferring to Blythedale Children's Hospital in suburban Westchester. There, they'll receive specialized rehabilitation care, the medical center said Thursday. The now 15-month-old twins were attached at the brain and the skull. The hospital says the boys suffered infections following the surgery, and Anias developed seizures that are now being controlled with medication. Seizures aren't uncommon among twins who were conjoined at the brain, Montefiore said. More on this...
