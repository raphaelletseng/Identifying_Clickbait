The world's most terrifying airport landings revealed
The world's most terrifying airport landings revealed


While a fear of flying might be common among travellers even the bravest of passengers would feel unnerved looking out of their aircraft window when landing at one of the world’s scariest runways.

From Scotland to Antarctica, skilful pilots are able to negotiate steep mountain landings, short beach runways and ones that only appear when the tide is out.

A fascinating infographic by travel agency Globehunters has rounded up 13 of the world’s most hair-raising airport landings.

Among the most nail-biting approaches is the flight into Narsarsuaq Airport, Greenland, which is said to be as beautiful as it is challenging. Pilots must fly up a fjord, make a U-turn and then face an onslaught of turbulence. The route is so terrifying that night-time take-offs and landings are banned.

Pilots also need nerves of steel to land at Tenzing-Hillary Airport, Nepal, which is used mostly by Everest climbers, as the runway ends with a 2,000ft drop into a valley.

Jet-setters flying into Courchevel ski resort may find the tricky flight over the slopes a sobering start to their holiday, while the Caribbean’s Juancho e Yrausquin Airport, Saba, will test the mettle of even the most experienced pilots, as the runway is one of the world’s shortest at just 1,300ft long.
