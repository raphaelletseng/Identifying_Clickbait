A 21-year-old man in Malaysia had to be rescued by firemen after he accidentally got his penis trapped in a water bottle.

According to reports, he decided to use the water bottle to relieve himself because he couldn't make it to the bathroom in time.

However when he tried to remove his penis, it became lodged in the bottle.

Taking matters into his own hands, the man then tried to use a metal saw to cut himself free but ended up injuring his penis and causing it to bleed.

The incident happened while he was at home in Teluk Gong, in Malaysia, on Friday.

Firefighters from the Port Klang and Andalas fire stations were called to the scene and managed to free the man's penis.

The victim was sent to the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital for treatment where he is said to be in stable condition.

It comes after doctors had to amputate a man's penis in Honduras last October after it became stuck in a bottle he was using as a sex toy for four days.

The 50-year-old man arrived at hospital with a penis that was 'black and decaying' according to medical staff.

It is understood the man was trying to 'relieve sexual frustration' because he did not have a wife or girlfriend.

A month later in a separate incident, a Chinese man who was too nervous about visiting a doctor because of blood in his urine tried to investigate the problem by inserting a chopstick in his penis.

The gentleman, named only as 'Chen', then had to undergo surgery to remove the painful object from his manhood.

Doctors said he could have died if he pushed the chopstick any further into his genitals.
