This decision is mine alone.” Yiannopoulos added: “When your friends have done right by you, you do right by them. For me, now, that means stepping aside so my colleagues at Breitbart can get back to the great work they do.” A Breitbart News company statement released after the press conference stated: “Milo Yiannopoulos’s bold voice has sparked much-needed debate on important cultural topics confronting universities, the LGBTQ community, the press, and the tech industry. “Milo notified us this morning of his decision to resign as editor of Breitbart Tech and we accepted his resignation.”
