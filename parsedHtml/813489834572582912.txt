Churchgoers in Sri Lanka open hymn books to explicit Tupac lyrics


Churchgoers in Sri Lanka were left stunned when they opened their hymn books to find explicit lyrics to a Tupac song.

In a shocking blunder, a church volunteer had printed the words to the rap legend's Hail Mary on a service sheet, instead of the Catholic prayer of the same name.

The 1997 rap, released a year after Tupac Shakur was shot dead, contains profane lyrics such as 'revenge is like the sweetest joy, next to getting p***y.'

The mistake shocked attendees at the Catholic Joy to the World Service in the Nelum Pukuna Theatre of Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital.

Andrew Choksy said he recognized the Tupac song straight away.

He told CNN: 'A lot of people were in shock as whether it was a joke or someone would actually rap the song.'

'A few of the older ladies in front of us could not stop looking at the printed booklet.'

Tupcac's violent rap contains references references to female genitalia and the N-word.

The 1997 rap, released a year after Tupac Shakur (pictured) was shot dead, contains profane lyrics such as 'revenge is like the sweetest joy, next to getting p***y.'

The prayer reads: 'Hail Mary full of grace, the lord is with thee,' but Tupac asks Mary: 'Do you want to ride or die?'

The service was advertised as 'a festival of music for peace and harmony.'
