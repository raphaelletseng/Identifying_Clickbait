Tony Romo's¬†professional sports retirement lasted less than a week. Just days after bowing out of the NFL to take a high-profile job with CBS Sports, Romo is taking a crack at another sport: basketball. According to a report from ESPN's Marc Stein, the Dallas Mavericks are going to allow Tony Romo to suit up for the team's home finale against the Denver Nuggets. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban wants to pay tribute to Romo's prolific career as a member of the Dallas Cowboys, and the team is taking it beyond putting a montage on the Jumbotron : With starting point guard Seth Curry ailing in recent days and officially out for the rest of the season because of a shoulder ailment, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has said on multiple occasions over the past week that the club would be looking to add "a pass-first point guard" before playing out the season's final five days. People within the organization, sources tell ESPN, say he has been referring to Romo. Though this is meant to honor Romo, Stein claims the Mavericks are going to treat him like an actual player on the roster for the day of the game; he will be in uniform and seated alongside other Mavericks players.
