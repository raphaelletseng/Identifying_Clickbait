Two women were kicked out of a homeless shelter to make room for a man because he said he is a transgender woman, according to a Canadian news report.

The women objected when they were told they would have to share a bedroom and live in the shelter with the man, and so “both were asked to leave the shelter for good,” said the TV reporter.

“I was uncomfortable with my roommate being transgender,” said one of the women, Tracey, in a TV reporter from Canada’s Global News network. “He wants to become a woman, I mean that is his choice but when a man comes into a women’s shelter who still has a penis and genitals, he has more rights than we do,” Tracey said.

Canada’s progressive laws forbid “discrimination” against people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex. That legal rule gives them legal authority over women and men who prefer to live, work and socialize with their own sex. The Canadian law even backs men who merely say they are “transitioning” and have not undergone sex-change surgery.

The second woman, Blaine, said the man’s arrival denies women any distance from men. “Some women have had bad experiences with men so they are fleeing men and now we have a man living there,” she said.

Blaine highlighted the central issue created by the transgender advocates’ demand that men and women be freely allowed to change their legal sex to match their self-selected “gender identity,” regardless of biology.

If enacted via the U.S. courts, the “gender identity” definition of legal sex would effectively eliminate single-sex facilities and institutions — such as bathrooms and showers, sports leagues and women’s shelters — because a man could simply say he has a female “gender identity” and then legally walk into the women’s facility, including a shower room.

“We need to make a fine line between the distinction of male, female and transgender,” said Blaine. “I think it’s all three different groups. I feel bad for this person, they are transitioning but they need to be in a place where they can associate with other people like them.”

Officials at the shelter declined to talk to Breitbart News.

Numerous polls show the “gender identity” claim is unpopular.
