"Just talking to her and getting to know her, she has been through crazy, crazy shit," Lil Internet said of Iggy. "She's so cool and so genuine about her work and so honest about what she's doing and so genuinely just into it. I can't speak for her, obviously, and that needs to be said first and foremost. I can't speculate what it's gonna do, but I'll tell you one thing: I know that this is her doing what she wants to do and expressing herself in a genuine way with music and a video that she was excited about and wanted to make."

Iggy told Zane Lowe on his Beats 1 show on Thursday that her new album, Digital Distortion, is 99 percent complete. So expect more news on Digital Distortion in the very near future.
