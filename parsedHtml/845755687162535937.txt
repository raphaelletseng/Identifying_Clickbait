Iraqi security forces alter tactics to protect civilians, officials say

(CNN) The US military conducted airstrikes at a location in western Mosul more than a week ago where there were allegations of civilian casualties, US Central Command said Saturday.

The military said it determined that warplanes struck ISIS fighters and equipment on March 17, but it's also investigating whether civilian casualties occurred.

Also Saturday, Iraq's Ministry of Defense opened an investigation into an "aerial bombardment incident" that took place in the same area of the city on March 22 and 23, said Col. Laith Al-Nuaimi, a ministry spokesman.

Bashar al Kiki, chairman of the Nineveh Provincial Council, told CNN Saturday that as many as 200 people were killed those days in "indiscriminate airstrikes" he blamed on Iraqi and coalition air forces in the western Mosul neighborhoods of al Jadidah, al Amel and al Yarmouk.

The US Central Command report doesn't mention strikes on March 22-23.
