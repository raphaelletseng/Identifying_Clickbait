Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo joined Instagram on Thursday.

Talk about an entrance.

The 36-year-old signal-caller posted a video of his two young sons, Hawkins and Rivers, running a football play. It was adorable. From Rivers' "I can't [run], I don't have the ball" to Hawk's bullet off his younger brother, this clip could've won big on America's Funniest Home Videos.

Romo was replaced by Dak Prescott as the Cowboys starter this year, and it seems plausible he'll be playing for another team in 2017.

Regardless of where he ends up, let's hope Romo keeps posting videos of his little guys.
