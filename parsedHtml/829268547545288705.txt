I grew up not loving how I looked and felt held back because of it.  ~'Twas a most humbling and rewarding HONOR to be a part of your February issue!🌹👑🖤 Thank you @si_swimsuit & @mj_day for making me feel so at home. This was a lesson in learning to let go, take the plunge, and embrace myself from both the inside AND out- which is something I struggle with each and every day. My purpose is to now pass along this lesson of unconditional self-love and self-respect to every woman who's willing to listen. Once again, from the bottom of my heart... Thank You.~ A photo posted by Alexa Ray Joel🌹 (@alexarayjoel) on "I don't know why I always felt that way, sure I had baby fat and definitely went through a plethora of awkward phases, but I had a family that loved me, I had friends who made me laugh etc. "But for some reason I still looked in the mirror and always somehow found something to pick on." owever, she said that she now feels beautiful and is happy with her body. he continued in the post: "I've looked in the mirror and been able to LOVE the things about my body that beauty norms deem ''undesirable''. I now have grown to know that my body is worthy of so many great things. "I don't need to be a size 0 to believe in myself. "My body carries me each and every day, it loves the people I love, it holds what makes me healthy and strong, it bends it shakes it runs and it CHANGES. That is okay and that is beautiful."
