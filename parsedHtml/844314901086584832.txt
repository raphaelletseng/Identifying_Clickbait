Trubisky is an accurate passer with the arm strength to make any throw required, and he's fast enough to buy himself time in the pocket and keep an opposing defense honest. However, he doesn't have a lengthy track record at the college level, which makes him an even riskier proposition than other rookie quarterbacks with more experience. Like the new article format?

The New York Jets signed Josh McCown Monday, giving them three quarterbacks on their roster. Despite that, the team may target another passer in the NFL draft.

ESPN.com's Rich Cimini reported Tuesday that the Jets are looking at Mitchell Trubisky as an option in the first round: "It would be a bold move to pick one at No. 6 overall, but the Jets are very intrigued by [Trubisky], widely regarded as the top QB prospect. They will be present Tuesday at his pro day and could return to Chapel Hill, North Carolina for a private workout. This is something to watch."

Cimini added that Bryce Petty, a fourth-round pick from 2015, would be the odd man out should the Jets draft another quarterback.

Most experts list Trubisky among the best passers in the 2017 draft class, but his relative inexperience at the FBS level leads to a level of skepticism about his potential in the NFL.
