MSNBC's Nance: Trump 'Pushing This Nation to a Constitutional Crisis' - Breitbart
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER In the wake of the Russian hacking allegations, MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance said Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy” that President-elect Donald Trump is “pushing” the United States towards a constitutional crisis because no one has ever worked for a “hostile nation.” FOR OUR NEWSLETTER “[Trump]’s gonna fight to the end to not allow this to become a narrative,” Nance stated. “I suspect in two weeks he’s going to attempt to cover this all up and even gut the intelligence community. Where he is going is he is pushing this nation to a constitutional crisis of unprecedented magnitude because no one has ever worked in the interest of a hostile nation and supporting, to a certain extent, a hostile intelligence service.”
