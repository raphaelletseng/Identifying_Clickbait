"Shahed installed ACs in both rooms to maintain a conducive temperature. He also kept LED lights above the plants to maintain natural light-like situation and kept table fans in swing mode to give them sufficient air," said Task Force additional DCP, N Koti Reddy.

With the help of his US-based pal,Â Garith Christopher, Hussain would take video tips and learn how to cultivate ganja in the right environment.
