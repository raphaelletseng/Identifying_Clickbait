Elderly woman is knocked unconscious when snow falls off a roof


An elderly woman was injured when an avalanche of snow and ice fell on her head from a high roof.

The pensioner was standing with a group of women in a street in the city of Voronezh in south-western Russia's Voronezh Oblast region when she was struck by the falling debris.

The incident was caught on CCTV cameras in the city, and residents have now called for authorities to do more to clear snow from roofs.

The woman was leaning on a metal fence on a pavement when a large pile of snow and ice suddenly slid from an overhead roof and landed on her.

She was knocked to the ground and lost consciousness. It is not clear whether she sustained any serious injuries.

Three other elderly women who were chatting nearby were unhurt.

The other women initially ran out of the way but then returned to check on the unconscious woman.

The CCTV footage shows the pensioner lying motionless as the other women gather around her, glancing nervously upwards in case more snow and ice falls.

All four had reportedly been waiting for a milkman to make a delivery from a nearby dairy farm.

Local residents summoned a female doctor who lives in a neighbouring block of flats to administer first aid.

The doctor quickly called an ambulance, which rushed the unnamed woman to hospital for treatment to her injuries.

After viewing the footage, one resident, Yaska said: 'Community workers should have cleared the roofs of snow and if not they should be held responsible. But I am sure they will get away with it.'
