Trump Rides a Market Wave, but Business Looks for Results
Trump Rides a Market Wave, but Business Looks for Results
The investor enthusiasm that began with President Trump’s unexpected victory in November has burst out anew on Wall Street, even as Washington remains gridlocked and evidence of any real pickup in the economy is scarce. Stocks have surged 5 percent since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. And that is on top of the 6 percent rally that followed his win in November. The cause for bullishness on Tuesday was Mr. Trump’s new call to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent — deficits, perhaps, be damned. “C.E.O.s are pragmatists,” said Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor who formerly ran Medtronic, the giant medical-device maker. “If you cut my taxes and ease up on regulations, then I will like you. The bigger question is, can he get anything done?” Advertisement The market impact of the Trump presidency is based so far on prospects — with details and congressional dynamics left to be sorted out — rather than accomplishments. Advertisement But plenty of other factors are providing a tailwind for traders, including unexpectedly strong earnings reports from blue-chip companies like Caterpillar and McDonald’s and the receding chances that French voters will turn their backs on Europe. Technology giants like Apple, Facebook and Amazon have shown robust growth, lifting the Nasdaq index past 6,000 for the first time on Tuesday, a 26 percent gain from a year ago. Blair Effron, a founder of Centerview Partners, a prominent independent investment bank on Wall Street, said he believed that beyond any immediate policy shift in Washington, investors had taken their cue from signs of healthier growth globally. Advertisement “Europe and emerging markets are doing better,” Mr. Effron said, “and there is an underpinning of global stability and growth that are having much more of an impact than people think.” Winners and Losers Under Trump Since President Trump was inaugurated, stocks have posted a gain of 5 percent over all, but the success have not spread evenly across industries. Technology stocks have grown at twice the overall rate, and the energy and telecom sectors have declined. Not all the signals domestically are coming in strong, however. The government’s initial report on the economy’s first-quarter performance is due Friday, and it is expected to be weak. Advertisement And even if Mr. Trump manages to get Congress to pass a tax overhaul, and corporate profits then boom, that will not necessarily translate into better overall economic performance, warned Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago. “We have to distinguish between pro-profit and pro-growth policies,” she said. “A pro-profit approach increases the share of the pie going to corporate earnings and shareholders. Pro-growth policies increase the size of the pie.” So far, Ms. Swonk said, the Trump administration seems to favor the former. And while Wall Street will always reward rising corporate profits with higher share prices in the short term, the country’s long-term prospects will be undermined if that trend is not accompanied by policies that lead to faster economic growth.
