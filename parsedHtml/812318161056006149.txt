In an earlier statement, Brazzers, which directly employees Ms Benz as one of its biggest stars, said it respected the rights of its actors.

It said: ““Brazzers considers performers’ consent, boundaries and limits and safety to be fundamental and paramount issues and unequivocally stands for the respect of the performers. Brazzers does not condone nor does it tolerate conduct by producers that would jeopardise a performer’s security or well-being.”

Ms Benz was not happy with the company's original response, branding it a "PR stunt".

A representative for Tony T told gossip ​website TMZ he “denies the allegations and laments the actions taken by Brazzers”. He is reported to be confident his name will be cleared.
