Sickening new ISIS video shows toddler shooting prisoner in PLAYGROUND


A sickening video appearing to show a toddler shooting a prisoner dead in a ball pit in Syria has been published online by Islamic State.

In the video, the child is seen walking across a ball pit, full of broken plastic balls, towards a prisoner who is tied to a fence by his wrists.

A man then hands the toddler a gun, and he is seen aiming the gun before seemingly pulling the trigger.

The footage then ends just after a shot is fired.

The child is seen walking over to the prisoner and handed a gun by the man in the background

He then aims the gun at the prisoner's head, who has been tied to the side of the ball pit

The child then seemingly pulls the trigger and the video ends swiftly afterwards

Screenshots of the video were published on the Twitter account, @Raqqa_SL, with the caption: 'new #ISIS propaganda video make small children Slaughtering And executed people #syria #ISIL' (sic).

The video comes after Iraqi forces took control of the eastern end of the southernmost bridge in Mosul, Iraq, today.

Elite Counter-Terrorism Forces (CTS) 'reached the Tigris River from the eastern (side) of the fourth bridge,' Sabah al-Noman told news agency AFP.

The news was also confirmed by Iraqi army Staff Lieutenant General Abdulamir Yarallah.

Their push to the banks of the Tigris River marks a symbolic and tactical victory for the Iraqi forces but they have much work left to do to take full control of Mosul's eastern side.
