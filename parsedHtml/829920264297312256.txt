Katy Perry Releases "Chained to the Rhythm," f/ Bob Marley's Grandson, Skip Marley 
Shortly after it was announced Katy Perry would perform at this week’s Grammy Awards , the 32-year-old singer began teasing a new track called “Chained to the Rhythm.” Perry shared a snippet of the song via an Instagram video, and also released a map that showed the locations of 24 disco balls around the world, where fans could plug in their headphones and hear the cut in its entirety . The rest of the world had to wait a little longer.

And, as many people predicted, it features Skip Marley, a new Island Records signee and the grandson of legendary musician Bob Marley. Perry showed love to Skip earlier this month, praising his new song “Lions,” and referring to him as “the voice of our revolution.” 🚨SKIP MARLEY. The voice of our REVOLUTION.

The project was expected to drop in late 2016; however, sources say the album was pushed back so Perry could include tracks about the 2016 presidential election . Ok back to the studio for me. 2017 is gonna tight af. 🔥 “Chained to the Rhythm” was co-written by Sia and is available now on iTunes , or you can stream it below via Spotify.
