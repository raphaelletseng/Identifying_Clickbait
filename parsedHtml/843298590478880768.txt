A woman in Darwin is recovering in hospital after she was seriously assaulted this morning then forced into a car that sped off, sparking a police chase.

NT Police said they went to the East Arm Boat Ramp just before 3:00am after being told by a member of the public about a woman being assaulted by a man that she knew.

"Upon seeing police, the driver sped off and a pursuit commenced through Berrimah and along the Stuart Highway towards Palmerston," Detective Sergeant David Allan said in a statement.

The police chase lasted about 10 minutes and the man's four-wheel-drive was followed to where the vehicle drove down a dirt track near Robertson Barracks.

The Police's elite Territory Response Group then used road spikes to stop the vehicle and searched for the man on foot.

The driver of the car, 39, then surrendered to police.

"A 38-year-old female was located within the car suffering injuries consistent with an assault," Detective Sergeant Allan said.

"She is currently in Royal Darwin Hospital where she is being assessed by medical staff."

Police have called for anyone who witnessed the assault to contact them.
