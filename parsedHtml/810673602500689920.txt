Despondent Rosie O'Donnell: 'I Hate What Has Become Of US'
Rosie O’Donnell wrote a powerful poem about sadness and despair in the current state of America on her website. On Monday, she published “ONE WEEK” and detailed her thoughts and emotions in the wake of the election of Donald Trump. A few paragraphs later, she wrote: She went on to implore the electors ― the 538 of whom will gather on Dec. 19 for the Electoral College vote to choose the next president ― not to vote for Trump. (Electors are chosen by party leaders, and in many states are bound by law to vote the way of the popular vote for their respective states, the New York Times noted. However, there’s still a “moon shot” chance .) O ’Donnell has been urging government leaders to investigate Russia’s interference in the U.S. election , and has been retweeting quotes against the leadership of Trump.

we have 7 days left

to pull off the impossible

stand up and say no

no to the darkness
