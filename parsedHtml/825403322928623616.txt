A teacher who had sex with her pupils said they made her “feel good” about herself.

Brianne Altice, from Utah, blamed “self-esteem issues” for the incidents with underage students.

The 37-year-old, who was married at the time of the events, was arrested after one of her 16-year-old victims notified the police.

Two other 17-year-olds then stepped forward and also claimed they had been having sex with the English teacher.

Altice, a mother of two, was jailed for 30 years in 2015 after pleading guilty to forcible sexual abuse and has now made an appeal for parole.

"They said this and that and made me feel good about myself. So I justified everything. There's no justification for it,” she said.
