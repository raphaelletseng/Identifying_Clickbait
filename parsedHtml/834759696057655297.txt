CPAC day one: Kellyanne Conway, Mike Pence and Steve Bannon speak – live

in Fort Washington, Maryland              Conway on feminism Conway used that short session to set out some of her ideas about women’s equality, although she probably wouldn’t put it like that herself. She rejected the term “feminism”, saying it was perceived as “anti-men” and “pro-abortion”, and said she was raised as a strong, independent woman without anyone using the word feminist or discussing politics. Her “I’ll have what he’s having” anecdote was a memorable call for equal pay, although it was clearly a call for each woman to fight for that equality individually rather than something that she felt could or should be achieved widely through legislation. She applied the same basic philosophy to the story of her mother, who she said got past the disadvantages life had given her by force of will - “she just figured it out” – rather than through any help the state or society might be able to offer. Given the opportunity by Schlepp, Conway tried to humanise Trump, although some may doubt the ability to “absorb information” of a man who at times has seemed woefully underprepared to weigh in on complex political issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Her claim that CPAC was now becoming “TPAC” seemed somewhat backed up by cheers for her remarks about Trump not being a typical politician and intending to shake up the system.      Conway says that during her career she found it difficult to ask for the amount of money she felt she was worth. In 1996 there was an incident when she did not know what sum to name for her speaking fee. So, referring to a fellow male speaker, she said, “I’ll have what he’s having.” “When in doubt just say, ‘I’ll have what he’s having,’” she says, to cheers. There is another standing ovation as she leaves the stage.      Schlepp asks how college students can “survive” in liberal institutions. “Don’t live online, live in real time,” Conway advises. “Make sure people see something other than the top of your head.” Join different clubs, start different clubs, write letters to the editor. Be willing to hear the word no more than you say it, she says. She also thanks the “old timers like me” in the audience for “sticking with the conservative movement”.      Trump replaced the “fiction of electability” with the “revelation of electricity”, she says. There are cheers when she says he is not a typical politician and that he is going to shake up the system.      What is Trump like in private? Conway says he can be kind, generous, and humorous, and a family man. “He’s a man who just absorbs information,” she says. The “typical motivators” of a politician – “power, money and fame” – he had all that, she says, implying that doesn’t motivate him. His biggest compliment is to say someone is “really high energy”, she says. “He works harder than anyone.” How has Trump impacted the conservative movement? “I think by tomorrow this’ll be TPAC!” she says, to some laughter.      Schlapp starts by asking Conway about her early life and becoming the first successful female campaign manager for a major party and her current job as counsellor to the president. Conway says that is a blessing. She says she was raised as a strong and independent woman “without anyone saying the word ‘feminist’ or having a political conversation”. She says it is not widely understood what a great boss Donald Trump is to women. She says that during the election women looked past “the commonality of gender” to vote for him. She says she is not comfortable calling herself a feminist because the term is “anti-male” and “pro-abortion”. She talks about how her mother overcame disadvantages by relying on her “moxy” – “she just figured it out”. She claims a lot of women “just have a problem with women in power”. Schlepp says “conservative women and men in this room – we support you”, to applause.      Conway gets a short standing ovation as she arrives.      Good morning from the Gaylord Convention Center just south of Washington DC. In the main hall Welcome to the Jungle by Guns ‘n’ Roses and NRA ads have given way to the pledge of allegiance and a Jimi Hendrix-style electric guitar version of The Star-Spangled Banner. Attendees – most dressed smartly, with the odd “socialism sucks” T-shirt and historical reenactment outfit in the mix – are beginning to gather for the opening speaker, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, who will be interviewed by Mercedes Schlapp of the Washington Times. Attendees begin to arrive at CPAC #CPAC2017  pic.twitter.com/DGufJKLHOI CPAC 2017 has kicked off! #CPAC2017  #CPAC  pic.twitter.com/ZbNNZo8puK Updated       When Donald Trump abruptly dropped out of a speaking slot at last year’s Conservative Political Action Conference amid threats of a walk-out and claims that he wasn’t a true conservative, his campaign put out a statement reassuring the annual rightwing grassroots gathering that he “looks forward to returning next year, hopefully as President of the United States”. Trump will indeed be returning as president this year – and not alone. Like the Republican party and the Washington DC establishment before it, CPac has become subject to a hostile takeover. This bastion of libertarianism and small-government, free-trade conservatism will this week be forced to reckon with the nationalist populism that has now become the dominant force in rightwing politics in the US. Perhaps no one besides Trump represents this strain of thought more clearly than , the White House chief strategist and former Breitbart boss who will speak today alongside , the White House chief of staff. The relationship between the upstart firebrand who the Democrats have called a white supremacist and the establishment former RNC chair in many ways symbolises the struggle for control of Trump’s agenda, and the way the two interact on stage will be fascinating to watch. Opening the day is another key Trump ally, adviser to the president , who since last year has made a career out of touring the TV studios channelling her master’s voice – and his disregard for the truth. Her coining of the phrase “alternative facts” may come to be remembered as one of the key phrases of post-truth politics, but one senses that despite this and other controversies, Trump probably enjoys and respects her scrappy style and her constant willingness to stick her neck out for him ( and his daughter’s businesses ). Later comes education secretary , whose performance at her confirmation hearing was judged so weak that Mike Pence was forced to use the vice-president’s Senate casting vote to confirm a cabinet nominee for the first time . Some of the issues that so exercised Democrats – such as her support for spending public money on private schools – will hardly worry this audience, but she may be keen to shift a perception that she has failed to master her brief. will round out the day – like Priebus a traditional conservative who is likely to use the opportunity to build bridges with his fellow rightwingers by emphasising the elements of Trump’s record so far they will appreciate – his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court, for example, or his executive order banning international NGOs from providing abortion services if they receive US funding. In among all these Trump loyalists a former enemy has snuck in: , who came first in the CPac “ straw poll ” of presidential candidates last year (Trump came third). Of course, Cruz eventually went on to endorse Trump, but not before being booed at the Republican convention for telling delegates to “ vote your conscience ” following a bad-tempered primary campaign in which the two men argued about each other’s wives and Trump infamously suggested Cruz’s father might have been involved in the assassination of JFK. The Texas senator is due to discuss the constitution today, and is likely to be more emollient, although any mention of the separation of powers or freedom of religion is bound to be interpreted as a dig at a president who has shown little appreciation for either. Trump will address the conference tomorrow, and some in the crowd may remain to be convinced. As baffling as it may seem on the left, some traditional conservatives still fear their new president is a liberal in sheep’s clothing, who couldn’t care less about their values and ideology and is willing to spend massively and undermine free trade to meet his promises to rust belt voters who want to see manufacturing jobs return and immigration curtailed. Conservatives “don’t think he’d ever read their novel, their policy paper, their magazine article — or even listen to them for more than five minutes,” anti-tax activist Grover Norquist recently told the New York Times . But perhaps it’s more likely they will put aside their differences and make nice with the man who stunned both their party and the country. Nothing succeeds like success. More on that tomorrow.
