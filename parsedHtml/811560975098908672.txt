Well that’s just rude! Cheeky chimp flips the finger at tourist


Chimps may not always be able to get their feelings across to humans, but this cheeky monkey has no problem expressing himself.

He stuck his middle finger up at holidaymaker Gil Gofer after he spent three hours 'tracking' him.

But rather than being offended, Gil, 28, said: 'It was the shot of a lifetime.'

It was taken at Kibale Forest in Uganda.

Gil, from Israel, said: 'It was the shot of a lifetime. We followed him for several hours and he was easy to follow because he moved at a relaxed and slow pace.

'The park ranger later told me that our chimpanzee star had a disorder in his hand and he obviously didn't mean to harm anyone's feelings.'
