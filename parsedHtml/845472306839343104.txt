The best photos from the NCAA Tournament so far
The best photos from the NCAA Tournament so far


The second weekend of March Madness action is underway, and the Sweet 16 has lived up to the hype.Â

On Thursday, Oregon and Gonzaga survived upset bids to reach the Elite 8. Xavier, an 11-seed, continued its Cinderella run by knocking off the Arizona Wildcats (a 2-seed).

And then there is Kansas, winning by a cool 31 against Purdue to move into the tournament's quarterfinal.

Chances are, by now your bracket is completely busted. But that's ok! Once your bracket is ruined, the only thing you have to worry about is enjoying the games.

And there are plenty ofÂ good ones! Most notably, the Sweet 16 features a Kentucky-UCLA matchup that will have NBA scouts salivating. But Florida-Wisconsin, UNC-Butler, and South Carolina-Baylor should all be fun, too.Â

To get yourself ready for the rest of the Sweet 16 and beyond, we compiled a list of our favorite photos.

Enjoy the rest of the tournament!
