Bizarre! Female Cricketer Scores 160, Teammates 0 In The Most Lopsided Batting Scorecard You' ll Ever See There are many occasions on a sporting field when bizarre things happen. And in one of those scenarios, a female teenage cricketer smashed 160 runs in a T20 game but her teammates failed to score even a single run. Yes, you heard it right. This happened at the Cricket South Africa's Under-19 Girls National Cricket Week's T20 match between Mpumalanga and Easterns in Pretoria when Mpumalanga's Shania-Lee Swart scored a blistering 160 off 86 balls and then proceeded to take 2/21 to help her team beat Easterns by 42 runs. While Swart managed 160, with nine extras Mpumalanga posted 169. The rest of her team-mates combined for a grand total of 0. Apart from Swart, who opened the innings, each one of her team-mates who came out to bat remarkably failed to open their accounts; three batters registered golden ducks, while No.10 Nicholate Phiri remained unbeaten on 0 as Mpumalanga got to 169 in their 20 overs. With Phiri, Swart managed a record partnership of 61 for the ninth wicket with Phiri facing only three balls in the entire partnership. With her superlative effort, Swart managed to score 95 per cent of her team's total. The Easterns, in reply, managed only 127/6. For the record, New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson has highest percentage or runs scored in a completed Twenty20 international innings when he scored 42 out of a total of 60 (70 per cent) against Sri Lanka in the 2014 World Twenty20.
