1MDB scandal: Singapore files 16 charges against Falcon branch manager amid bank probe

Updated

Singapore prosecutors have filed 16 charges against the local branch manager of Swiss-based Falcon Private Bank AG, as part of an ongoing investigation tied to scandal-hit state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).

The bank, which is also under investigation in Switzerland, was the second Swiss lender whose Singaporean unit was ordered to cease operations last year after BSI Bank Ltd.

1MDB, founded by Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak, is the subject of money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States.

US investigators traced nearly $US700 million that was sent from an account at Falcon in Singapore in 2013 to accounts in Malaysia belonging to "Malaysian Official 1", which US and Malaysian officials have said refers to Mr Najib.

Mr Najib, who also chaired 1MDB's advisory board, has denied wrongdoing and said Malaysia will cooperate with international investigations.

1MDB has also denied wrongdoing.

In Singapore, prosecutors filed 10 charges of providing false information, five charges of failing to disclose suspicious information and one charge of failing to submit suspicious transactions against Swiss national Jens Sturzenegger, who headed Falcon's local branch.

Falcon's Mr Sturzenegger intends to plead guilty at a hearing on January 11, his lawyer told the court.
