Former Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson was banned from a QuikTrip store in Gwinnett County, Georgia, after police said he exposed himself to a store clerk Wednesday, according to Steve Burns of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Per TMZ Sports: "The clerk reported a black male had walked into the store early Wednesday morning, slurred something and started handing over money. He started walking around the store. A short while later he walked up to the clerk and took out his penis and started masturbating."

The clerk then called 911. The call can be heard below:

The clerk decided against pressing charges, per Burns, so Anderson was issued a warning for criminal trespassing, meaning if he returns to the store he will be arrested.

Anderson appeared to be intoxicated, according to authorities, who ordered him an Uber to take him home, per TMZ.

It's the second time in recent months that Anderson has run afoul of the law. In August, he was charged with a suspended license and a move-over violation, per Burns, and he has also been arrested on DUI charges in both Hall and Gwinnett counties in the past. He was also arrested on drug possession charges in 2009.

Anderson, 44, spent eight seasons in the NFL (1994-2001), all with the Falcons.
