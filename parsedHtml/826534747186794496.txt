This is the heart-warming moment a mother gorilla planted a loving kiss on her two-month-old baby's cheek.

The cute baby had been sucking on his fingers as he cuddled up to his mother in Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda.

And the adult ape was so overwhelmed by her youngster had she couldn't help but kiss his cheek and reassure him as they sat in the dense vegetation.

The tender moment was caught on camera by photographer Nelis Wolmarans from Cape Town, South Africa, who was visiting the park.

The 42-year-old said: 'They were both completely wrapped up in each other, and showed no interest in our presence.

'The strong maternal bond was so evident by the gentle manner in which she nurtured her baby - she was so in love with this little bundle of fur.

'At times she would press the little one against her chest, and then lift it up again and just stare at it, as if in disbelief.

'We kept our distance and there was never a reason for her to feel threatened - but I have no doubt that she would protect this little one to her last breath should the need arise.

'I've completed 42 mountain gorilla treks, and every trek is as exciting as the first one.

'It's an experience that I can't express in words, as nothing I am able to describe will do this experience justice.

'There is such a strong connection between humans and these majestic primates, both physically and emotionally.

'Sitting in such close proximity to these gentle giants is an overwhelming experience.'
