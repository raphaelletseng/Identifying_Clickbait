This is the beginning and in future I hope you will get more recognition. My love and best wishes are always with you. Keep fighting hard." Heena felt that the Indian contingent's performance was an inspiration for her. "Being an athlete is very tough. It is full of ups and down.

It's a proud moment for me to see any other athlete, across sports, across nations fighting their way through the tough times. It is inspiring for everyone," she said. "I am also going through a rough patch, Saina has been going through with her knee surgery and all. So, we are always looking for a source of inspiration and you guys have given us that today" Saina, who took time out from her busy training schedule as she prepares for the India Open Superseries that starts Wednesday, said it was refreshing to be in their company and felt inspired to do well in her career too. "I feel fresh after coming here today. I was continuously training for the Indian Open but seeing you today has given me the strength that if you can so should I. We being a normal athlete cannot even think of winning 73 medals but you guys have done it. It's an emotional day but a day to celebrate for us," she said, drawing loud cheers.

Saina then reiterated the importance of developing sporting culture and also expressed her disappointment at India not being able to produce athletes in proportion to its population. Nevertheless, she is happy with the change in attitude in the past few years that has seen the government and corporates taking more efforts to support the budding athletes.

"We are all very special because there aren't too many sportspersons in India. I feel very sad about it. Population wise we are second only to China but when it comes to sports we are very far at the back," she said. "10-15 years ago, we weren't getting the support like we get today. So, I would like to thank the government for that. Corporates are also coming forward now. What else do we need?"

Saina lso had a message for the upcoming generation: "Becoming an engineer or doctor is fine but being a sportsperson is equally important."

Speaking at the occasion, Air Marshal, Denzil Keelor, CEO of Special Olympics Bharat said, "These (special) children participating do not want any money. They want to be treated fairly and accepted to be the way they are. They want respect and nothing else. Respect them for their abilities, not disabilities."
