People reveal the EXACT moment they knew they'd met the one


The turning point in a relationship can come when you least expect it.

A Reddit user asked others to share the moment when they knew they wanted to spend the rest of their life with their partner - and many responses weren't conventionally romantic.

Rather than a lavish gift or elaborate gesture from their other half inspiring their undying devotion, one woman says she knew she'd met The One when she got sick in his car on their third date and he didn't run a mile.

Rather than becoming angry, the woman says her partner brought her home, looked after her, and waited with her until he knew she was alright.

Many Reddit users said they knew a partner was a keeper when they actually wanted to spend time with their family - rather than feeling obliged to do so.

And one woman was especially touched when her then boyfriend taught her to drive the moment she mentioned that she didn't know how to.

Other frank confessions came from people said it was when they were finally comfortable enough to be able to pass wind in front of each other.

Lots of people seemed to realise that their partner was a keeper when they nursed them through an illness

Others said the moment they realised was when they realised they wanted to spend all day in pyjamas playing video games and eating - and their partner said it was a 'perfect' idea
