Is this the ultimate mobile home for the apocalypse?
Is this the ultimate mobile home for the apocalypse?


When preparing for the apocalypse most people opt for an armoured, underground bunker - but what if your apocalyptic bunker had a 400-litre diesel engine stuck on the front?

Painted in military green, weighing more than 20 small cars and fitted with six giant off-road wheels, the supersized 'Action Mobil Globecruiser Family 7500' would not look out of place in a war zone.

The massive vehicle was designed by Austrian firm Action Mobil for people driving on long road trips in tough terrains. It has a 530-horsepower engine and comes with a £630,000 ($765,000) price tag.

Each monster camper weighs eight tonnes, around 18,000kg (40,000lbs), and measures just under 10 metres (33ft) long and 3.8 metres (12.5ft) high.

It stores enough fuel to last users days out in the wilderness and can hold 1,000 litres of fresh water on board. Along 240 Watt solar panels, some might say, it has everything you need to survive an apocalypse.

The vehicle is described as a 'motor home for global cruises' by Action Mobil, who claim that they designed the vehicle for comfort in the harshest of conditions.

THE PERFECT POST-APOCALYPTIC VEHICLE? The Globecruiser Family 7500 is the perfect vehicle for the apocalypse. Its huge 400 litre, 530-horsepower diesel engine and 6x6 chassis mean it is designed to deal with any rough terrain, and holds enough fuel to last several days on the road. The average human uses around 20 litres of water a day for hydration and sanitation. The 7500's impressive 1000 litre fresh water capacity means one person could live out of the vehicle for around 50 days. Four 240 Watt solar panels fixed to the roof of the vehicle means it will power its appliances long after it has run out of fuel. The state-of-the-art electrical oven, microwave, induction hob and fridge/freezer system allow survivors to cook up a quick meal in no time. Two 2,400 Watt air conditioning units will keep users cool and dry in the potentially brutal post-apocalyptic heat. Satellite television will offer much needed escapism from the hopeless post-apocalyptic world.
