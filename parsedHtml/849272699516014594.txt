Actor Alec Baldwin has opened up about his personal and professional life in a new memoir that reveals the regrets and pain with which he says he has learned to live.

In an appearance Monday on Good Morning America to promote the new book, titled Nevertheless, the 30 Rock alum and newly minted Saturday Night Live star told host George Stephanopoulos that a 2007 voicemail to his daughter Ireland — subsequently leaked to the media — caused a “permanent break” in their relationship.

“It’s thrown in your face every day,” Baldwin said of the audiotape that made headlines nearly ten years ago. The voicemail caught Baldwin calling his then-11-year-old daughter a “rude, thoughtless little pig.”

“There are people who admonish me, or attack me, and use that as a constant spearhead to do that,” the actor said. “It’s a scab that never heals because it’s been picked at all the time by so many people. I think my daughter, that’s hurt her in a permanent way.”

It seems, however, that the Boss Baby star and his daughter have put the incident behind them.

In 2015, they posed in a photo together seemingly making light of the voicemail incident.
