Smurfette Is Shunned in Israeli Ultra-Orthodox City

Bnei Brak, Israel (AP) -- Israel's pious ultra-Orthodox Jewish community has long chafed at public displays of women, whether the images are of female public figures or ordinary women. Now even animated characters appear to be a no-go. The PR company promoting "Smurfs: The Lost Village" movie, which opens Thursday in Israel, says it has removed the images of Smurfette — the only female among the Smurf characters — from promo posters in the central Israeli city of Bnei Brak. The Mirka'im-Hutzot Zahav company says it did so as not to offend the city's ultra-Orthodox residents. The original poster shows Smurfette alongside friends Brainy, Clumsy and Hefty. But in Bnei Brak, she's nowhere to be found. The ultra-Orthodox press in Israel has previously avoided publishing pictures of Hillary Clinton during last year's American presidential race.
