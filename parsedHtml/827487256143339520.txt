I’ve lost faith in men. They seem incapable of genuine affection or loyalty

am a woman in my 40s who has lost all faith in men. My first husband was unfaithful, my second racked up vast debts and lost our home. I then had a relationship with a long-term friend, with whom I fell deeply in love, but he treated me cruelly in the end and I had a breakdown. Recently, a man I thought of as a friend sexually assaulted me, leaving me traumatised. I have concluded that men are incapable of genuine affection or loyalty, and that most of them actively dislike women. When I was married, I felt like a skivvy and replacement mother figure. Since I have been single, men seem to think the only thing I am good for is sex. I don’t want to feel this way. I enjoy sex and miss the intimacy of a relationship. What can I do to get myself out of this rut of negative thinking and move on with my life? Topics  Relationships
