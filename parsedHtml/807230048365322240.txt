Raiders Punter Marquette King Had a Savage Response to Travis Kelce Stealing His Dance
Raiders punter Marquette King is having himself one hell of a week, isn’t he? On Sunday, he made headlines after he picked up a penalty flag and danced with it on the field, which then resulted in getting a flag: Marquette King = 🐐 https ://t.co/OWectsEyLk He then made headlines again after he accused a Bills player of ratting him out to a referee as he did his dance: Oooooo so that's how I got caught... 😏 pic.twitter.com/VPuvLWcvFK And during the Raiders/Chiefs game on Thursday night, NFL fans went wild after Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce mocked King by doing his dance right in front of him after his teammate Tyreek Hill scored a touchdown on a punt return. Kelce was flagged for doing it, but he didn’t look like he cared: How savage is @tkelce rn?! pic.twitter.com/WlECajiGwO Following the game, Kelce was asked about why he decided to dance in front of King, and he said that he did it because King told him he doesn’t "have any rhythm": “He told me I didn’t have any rhythm.”  “... Trust me, wait until I get in the end zone, i’ll show you some rhythm.” https://t.co/sfMIc89HDC When Kelce started dancing, King didn’t seem all that upset about it. The two did briefly exchange a few words, but that was as far as it went. However, after King saw that the NFL posted video of Kelce dancing on its official Twitter account, he responded by letting the world in on what he said to Kelce after he stole his dance: I told him I don't need a reality show to find a girl lol... https://t.co/O54A8nCA0b Damn! Of course, Kelce and the Chiefs ultimately got the last laugh by winning the game 21-13. But still, King is really representing for punters everywhere this week, huh?
