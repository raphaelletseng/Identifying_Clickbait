Yay! It’s Women’s Day! Rejoice, girls! It’s the only day of the year when you will be made to feel relevant to the society – the only day when you’ll be respected for being born in a gender other than male.

Feeling happy that, at least, for one day in the entire year, women are considered respect-worthy? Singer Shalmali Kholgade says, “Why just today?!”

Woke up with your phone flooded with women’s day wishes? Shalmali Kholgade also did.

“These messages sound more like a formality and less of a feeling! But the sad truth is that this gratitude and love is limited to this day, and takes a backseat on the other 364 days of the year,” she wrote to TOI.

And yeah…when will we celebrate women’s dignity? Do we need a day for that too?

“Because Women's Day might come and go but I'm not sure if I can vouch for the same regarding a woman's dignity.”

We don’t need celebration. We need equality, right? And no judging eyes tracking us constantly!

“Let's work towards ensuring that a woman is not judged for being overtly ambitious or for choosing to give up a job to raise her children. I hope we have a day, in our near future, where women and men are both celebrated, free from prejudices and judging eyes, where equality comes through in its true form. That's the day I wish to celebrate!”

You know, why men’s day is not celebrated with enough enthusiasm? Because every day is men’s day, isn’t it?
