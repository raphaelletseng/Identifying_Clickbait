Ever Wondered Why Some People Have That Tiny Extra Hole In Their Ear?
Ever Wondered Why Some People Have That Tiny Extra Hole In Their Ear?
Ever Wondered Why Some People Have That Tiny Extra Hole In Their Ear? It might look like a piercing just above the top of the ear cartilage. In fact, for a few people, it is barely even noticeable. But this hole is also known as the ear pit and connects the ear to the sinuses inside. Just 0.1 percent of the population have it in the US, 0.9 percent in the UK, and as many as 4 to 10 percent in Asia and parts of Africa, according to one study. In South Korea, the same figure could be as high as 5 percent, as the ear pit is most common in people of African or Asian descent. The ear pit is, in fact, actually a congenital disorder called preauricular sinus. Although harmless in itself, it can be susceptible to infection. It is caused by the first and second pharyngeal arches. This is a structure found in all vertebrates and occurs during embryonic development. In some mammals, the ear pit goes on to form the structures of the head and neck, but in fish they help develop into their gills. It’s this odd connection that led Neil Shubin, an evolutionary biologist, to speculate that the holes could be an "evolutionary remnant of fish gills." Of course, that’s currently a theory that hasn't been scientifically tested yet. But when you think of our tailbones, goosebumps, and appendixes from our evolutionary forebearers, it's certainly not impossible.
