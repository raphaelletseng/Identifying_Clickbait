Camila Cabello Exits Fifth Harmony: Social Media Reacts

Fifth Harmony is now four. The pop group dropped a pre-Christmas bombshell with the revelation that singer Camila Cabello has departed, with the remaining members Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane Hansen and Lauren Jauregui committed to moving forward as a four-piece.

After forming on the second season of the American version of The X Factor in 2012, Fifth Harmony released two full-length albums: Reflection from 2015 (which reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200) and 7/27 from earlier this year (peaking at No. 4).

Cabello has already enjoyed fame outside of 5H. Her duets with Shawn Mendes and Machine Gun Kelly ("I Know What You Did Last Summer and "Bad Things", respectively) have both cracked the top 20.

News of Cabello’s departure from 5H broke Sunday following the year's final Jingle Ball performance, leaving many to share their thoughts, tears and conspiracy theories on social media. See how fans and observers reacted.
