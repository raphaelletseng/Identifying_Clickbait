Letters: Fights, faints, frustration – the daily commute on Southern railways

IR – The Southern rail dispute is near crisis point for commuters caught between management and unions, with little hope of a resolution and a Government that seems not to care. We are supposed to “carry on regardless”. Southern rail has not been able to provide a decent service for months, if not years. Staff shortages mean that cancellations are a normal part of the commute even on non-strike days. It speaks to management incompetence, union belligerence and government inadequacy. It seems obvious, but south London and surrounding counties need a railway that works, for the well-being of the capital and the national economy. Yet the Government buries its head in the sand and there appears no desire to resolve the dispute. I am not really sure what it is about any more. Is it simply about who closes the train doors or is there a deeper agenda either to crush the unions or nationalise...
