(CNN) Obviously it was a tongue-firmly-planted-in-cheek kind of tweet. But in this climate where people perceive anything and everything through their own political prism, it didn't go over well.

Betsy DeVos, the new Secretary of Education, sent out this tweet soon after starting her job.

Tweeters responded in droves.

Some took a jab at her lack of experience for the job.
