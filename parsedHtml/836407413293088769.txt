Donald Trump Managed to Make Oscars Screw-Up About Him
If there's one thing you can bet your life on, it's that Donald Trump will always find a way to spin a story back in his direction. After last night's Academy Awards ceremony ended with winning for Best Picture only to find out that should have been given the award, you knew Trump was somehow going to make this about him. Oh, and if you had him using "Oscars" and "sad" in the same paragraph in your office pool, you won! The most surprising part of Trump's commentary about the Oscars was that he had nothing to say about the show's host Jimmy Kimmel , who was goading Trump all night long. Hey @realDonaldTrump u up?

“I think they were focused so hard on politics that they didn’t get the act together at the end,” Trump told Breitbart in an exclusive interview. “It was a little sad. It took away from the glamor of the Oscars. It didn’t feel like a very glamorous evening. I’ve been to the Oscars. There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad.”
