This Video of Marshawn Lynch Exploring Scotland Is the Best Thing You'll Watch Today 
Marshawn Lynch needs his own TV show. We came to that conclusion after seeing his incredible appearance on back in September. But just in case you somehow managed to sleep on Lynch surviving out in the wild, he just took part in yet another incredible video that proves he’s made for TV. Lynch didn't slaughter any hogs or cut off any of his dreads to make a campfire this time around, but he did take a trip to Scotland to talk to people about the Super Bowl. And in the process, he also visited an ancient castle, got into a sword fight, discussed kilts, played the bagpipes, and did a bunch of other stuff that’ll leave you wondering how he doesn’t have TV executives banging down his door trying to give him his own show. In fact, just about everyone who has seen the hilarious video today has taken to social media to call for someone—anyone!—to give Lynch a show. If it’s even half as funny as what he’s put together in this three-minute clip, people think it would be a hit: Please somebody give Marshawn Lynch his own show pic.twitter.com/w2RR45zjSF Please somebody give Marshawn Lynch his own show 😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀😂😂💀💀💀😂 pic.twitter.com/tfuhp7VSY8 Marshawn Lynch getting a TV show is the best idea since indoor plumbing.
