It's fair to assume that the next step for most on the plane was to find the nearest bed. This rings particularly true for 38-year-old linebacker James Harrison, who played all but three of Pittsburgh's 58 defensive snaps and was involved in arguably the biggest play of the game.

Instead, Harrison went to an early morning gym session.

Between the New York Giants wide receivers' controversial Miami trip, Antonio Brown's Facebook Live mishap and now Harrison, this NFL season, if nothing else, has provided us a range of interesting reactions to wins.
