Kim Jong-nam assassination: Malaysia expels North Korean ambassador Kang Chol

Updated

Malaysia has expelled the North Korean ambassador to the country, asking him to leave within 48 hours and declaring him "persona non grata" after his comments Malaysia's investigation into the murder of Kim Jong-nam could not be trusted.

The move came nearly three weeks after the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was murdered at Kuala Lumpur's airport with a toxic nerve agent.

US and South Korean officials have said he was killed by agents of the North Korean regime.

Kang Chol, North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia, said last month his country "cannot trust" Malaysia's handling of the probe, and also accused the country of "colluding with outside forces" in a veiled reference to bitter rival South Korea.

Malaysia's Foreign Minister Anifah Haji Aman said in a statement on Saturday that Malaysia had demanded an apology from the ambassador for his comments, but none was forthcoming.

"Malaysia will react strongly against any insults made against it or any attempt to tarnish its reputation," Mr Anifah said.

Indonesian woman Siti Aisyah and Vietnamese woman Doan Thi Huong remain in custody as suspects in the murder, while three North Korean suspects are at large but are believed to still be in Malaysia.

Police released another North Korean suspect, Ri Jong-chol, on March 4, due to a lack of evidence.
