You thought you was Kobe?"

Early this morning, "The Truth" fired back with a vicious subtweet that's lighting up the Twitter-sphere today:

The Warriors can still point to the scoreboard, though. Their comeback win over the Clippers last night at Oracle Arena, highlighted by a 50-point third-quarter explosion, was their 10th straight win over their heated adversaries dating back to the 2014-15 season. It's the second straight season Golden State has swept the season series.
