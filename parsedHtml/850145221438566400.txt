What followed was entirely predictable: people were (rightfully) outraged, French initially defended himself with specious arguments about his family history, and then he apologized, saying on the Breakfast Club that "I ain't know 'nappy' was a racist word."

If you've followed French Montana's career up to this point, you know there were plenty of other times he said something he probably shouldn't have. Below, our list of the (other) most notable times French put his foot in his mouth.

"I think everybody should say 'nigga.'"

During an interview on Vlad TV, French was asked his thoughts on the n-word. The Moroccan rapper replied, "I think everybody should say 'nigga.' There's a lot of bitch-ass niggas, bitch-ass bitches... people want to get too mathematical with shit."

The only reasonable response?

"I don't even know how to use an email."

During a sit-down with Angie Martinez, French revealed a very, um, interesting reason why he chose not to sign with Kanye West.

"Kanye doesn‚Äôt have a phone. If you need to get in contact with Kanye, you have to email him," he said. "You can‚Äôt tell me how to do that. I don‚Äôt know how to use an email, so I guess me and you is never gonna talk, and I‚Äôma put my career in your hands?"

"All the lyrical rappers is broke."

While talking to Angie again two years later (you'd think everyone involved would have learned their lesson), French let fly another gem.

French's publicist: You‚Äôre a citizen now? A green card don't make you a citizen? French's publicist: No. He can‚Äôt vote so we‚Äôll skip that question.

The 10 Snipe Commandments

Yet again, French's birthday got him in trouble. In 2016, Montana revealed to the world that he had gotten a gift from Drake: a framed version of their 10 Snipe Commandments‚Äî"rules" they'd developed for dealing with women. Yes, it's real. He put it on Instagram, so that the whole world could see important (and strangely specific) laws like "Thou shall never tell a ting about another man‚Äôs splash in order to execute his own splash" and "Thou shall only splash unprotected if the ting a must splash or you are too fry or you trust the vibe or you plan to keep the vibe for a minimum of 6 months with 4 interactions within the allotted time period."
