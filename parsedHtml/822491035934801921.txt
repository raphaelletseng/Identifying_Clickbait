Mr. Trump painted a dismal picture of the state of the nation Friday, blasting what he called the “American carnage” of the past. He ticked off a list of problems in the U.S.: “Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.” “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” he said. He promised “winning like never before” and victory in the fight against “radical Islamic terrorism.” As protesters clash with police officers in the streets of Washington, D.C. Mr. Trump also attempted a call for unity in his address, declaring “when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice” in the nation. “Whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots,” he said.

Mike Pence gets sworn in as vice president. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York takes the stage, saying he is “confident” in the U.S. because of the American people. “Whatever our race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity; whether we are immigrant or native-born; whether we live with disabilities or do not; in wealth or in poverty; we are all exceptional in our commonly held yet fierce devotion to our country, and in our willingness to sacrifice our time, energy, and even our lives to making it a more perfect union,” Schumer said, just minutes before Mr. Trump would take the presidential oath of office. Prayers start at the inauguration ceremony. The inauguration ceremony, several minutes behind schedule, begins with the introduction of Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump.

President George W. Bush wrote a letter to Mr. Obama in 2009 and President Bill Clinton wrote one to Bush in 2001. In the letters, Bush congratulated Mr. Obama but warned, “There will be trying moments. The critics will rage. Your ‘friends’ will disappoint you,” and Clinton told Bush, “The burdens you now shoulder are great, but often exaggerated. The sheer joy of doing what you believe is right is inexpressable.” Hillary Clinton arrives at the U.S. Capitol to witness Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony.

Conway said the president-elect will “take a couple of executive actions” Friday, and then by Monday she predicted “you’ll see him rolling back some of the job killing regulations” that he considers to be “unconstitutional measures.” When asked whether that would include environmental regulations, Conway said “possibly, yes.” Just as the president-elect readies for the inauguration ceremony, U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies are looking at interceptions of both communications and financial transactions as part of “a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald J.

“From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” he said. He promised “winning like never before” and victory in the fight against “radical Islamic terrorism.”

7:15 a.m. ET Kellyanne Conway, a top aide to Donald Trump, gave an inside look at the president-elect’s inaugural address early Friday, promising a “beautiful, elegant speech” personally written by the celebrity businessman.

“You’re going to hear a man of action, a man of resolve in what we all know to be a divided country,” Conway told “CBS This Morning.” She predicted he would “lay down an important marker to try to unify the country” and promised that he would reach out to those who didn’t support him.

Conway said the president-elect will “take a couple of executive actions” Friday, and then by Monday she predicted “you’ll see him rolling back some of the job killing regulations” that he considers to be “unconstitutional measures.”

When asked whether that would include environmental regulations, Conway said “possibly, yes.”
