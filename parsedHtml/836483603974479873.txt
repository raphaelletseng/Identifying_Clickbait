SpaceX Will Take Two Travelers Around The Moon On A Trip Beginning Next Year!
SpaceX Will Take Two Travelers Around The Moon On A Trip Beginning Next Year! SpaceX plans to launch two paying passengers on a tourist trip around the moon as early as next year, the company announced on Monday. This will be the first privately funded tourist flight beyond the orbit of the International Space Station. Space Exploration Technologies Chief Executive Elon Musk said the launch is tentatively going to happen in late 2018. Musk, however, did not specify the chargers and neither did he identify the customers. He did say that it is “nobody from Hollywood”. He also said that the two future-tourists will undergo “extensive training before going on the mission”. "I think there's a market for one or two of these per year," he added. According to this travel plan to the moon, the two people will be flown around 480,000-640,000 km from Earth past the moon before Earth's gravity pulls the spacecraft back into the atmosphere for a parachute landing. Musk said the privately funded moon expedition would take place after his California-based company begins flying crew to the International Space Station for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
