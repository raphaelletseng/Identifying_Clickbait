It’s no secret that fans have been vocal about YG’s albums being shut out of the Best Rap Album category. In 2014, when My Krazy Life was snubbed from the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, he told Power 106 Los Angeles that it was a “slap in the face.” It sparked protests by his fans who decided to picket outside of the Grammy Museum.

YG’s next release, Still Brazy, received more accolades from critics, yet the album wasn’t nominated for the 2017 Grammy Awards. You can watch a round-up of other omissions below.

Hopefully, Elarbi’s statement nudges the Grammy committee to give YG the nomination he deserves. His next project is Just Re'd Up 3 that finds him reuniting with DJ Mustard again.
