Are these the most awkward heavy metal bands ever?
Are these the most awkward heavy metal bands ever?


From overweight KISS wannabes to pouting rockers in Marie Antoinette wigs, these hilarious photographs show that heavy metal bands come in all shapes and sizes.

The collection of bizarre images, which were shared on Awkward Family Photos, capture the outrageous members of more than a dozen groups bringing out their best outfits for the camera.

Some stick with convention in over-the-top leather outfits and sky-high mullets while others push the style boundaries - dressing up in police hats, wrestling belts and ripped neon tights for their photo shoots.

Meanwhile a handful of the heavy metal enthusiasts look more like bank clerks than musicians - eschewing leather and glitter in favour of a shirt and tie.

Here, FEMAIL reveals some of the best awkward band photos.

Less is more: These KISS-inspired musicians let their bodies take centre stage as they pose topless for the camera

Smouldering: Pouting with their hands on their hips, this rock band is channeling their inner red carpet star with their pose

Outrageous: A lace-up leather corset, animal-print chaps, a wrestling belt and a Marie Antoinette wig all make an appearance

Where to begin? It is difficult to know what this group were thinking with this picture - or why a pizza cutter was used as a prop

Too cool for school: One rocker flashes his best smile, left, while another ditches leather and denim in favour of a shirt and tie

Golden gang: Matching old lam√© outfits, black platform boots and lots of bare skin compete for attention in this picture

Tough stuff: This band showed off their weapons as they struck a pose in wrestling boots, leather hotpants and biker vests

Take one: White-and-black striped tights, oversized necklaces and strange posing make this picture one of the most bizarre

Take two: Trying something new with the next shot, the band brought in their instruments... and straddled a sex doll

Unimpressed: While this band went some way towards co-ordinating their outfits, two of them look like they're bored to tears

Neon nights: Heavy metal is given a rave twist by this group, who accessorised their crop tops and tights with bands and belts

Thumbs up! Wigs in disarray, these slightly dazed rockers want to spell out exactly what their group is about

Colour clash: The amount of plastic in this band's outfits is rather alarming - but at least their eye shadow's impressive

Blue steel: This rockstar - with some elaborate props - looks as though he's been taking inspiration from Zoolander

Boyband charm: This group look more like they're going to woo you with love songs - not shake you with heavy metal belters

What is that? There must have been something very fascinating out of shot - or else they have just seen their fringes

Ultimate costume: Bat wings, studded wristbands, flamed boots and a 'Demon Boy' belt should have created the perfect look

Picture perfect: The soft touch of rouge on their cheeks makes it look like these rockers have been made up by their mother

Oiled up: Bringing a caveman vibe to their album cover shoot, the members of Manowar pose in furry bots and leather pants

Fierce: While the blue lipstick, wigs and leather outfits might not work, at least this band is fully committing to the shoot

Bikini body ready: Eager to show off their toned torsos, Manowar opted to squeeze their pecs into low-cut tops
