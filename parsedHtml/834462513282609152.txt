Samsung Electronics is planning to move hundreds of manufacturing jobs currently operating in Mexico to the United States, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Citing several sources, the Journal said Samsung, known best as a cellular phone manufacturer, is in talks to move 500 of its range manufacturing jobs northward in a yet-to-be-determined time frame.

Though no commitment has been reached, if Samsung successfully moves those jobs to the United States, they may also choose to shift other appliance production lines.

Those products would include the company's washers, dryers and refrigerators.

The corporation's consideration for a move to America was influenced by President Donald Trump's overtures toward businesses willing to help revitalize blue-collar industries, the Journal reported.

"This is a complex process that ... will not be made final until it is determined through proper due diligence and planning that it is the best option for Samsung," the South Korean company told the paper.
