German grandma 'buried her dead friend in a tomato patch'
Grandma 'buried her dead friend in a tomato patch'


A grandmother has gone on trial in Germany for burying her dead friend in her garden tomato patch and claiming nearly £120,000 of her benefits.

Marie-Luise Schmidt, 75, interred her 81-year-old friend Elise Wagner, who lived with her, in the garden of her home in Giessen over a decade ago.

She shared the tomatoes that were planted on top of the corpse with neighbours who had no clue as to what was fertilizing them.

Marie-Luise Schmidt, 75, from Giessen, Germany, was sentenced to three years in jail for burying her dead friend in her garden tomato patch and claiming nearly £120,000 in benefits. But as it was never authorised by a higher court, she remains free

But she kept Ms Wagner's social security and pensioner benefits for herself.

Last year she was sentenced to three years in jail for the swindle but Germany's often torturous legal process meant that the term was never authorised by a higher court and she remained free.

The trial this week, which is being held in a bid to put her behind bars, the court heard that Ms Wagner - who had no family or friends - died of natural causes.

But the local authority alerted police when she was no longer seen around town.

A verdict in the case is expected on April 26.
