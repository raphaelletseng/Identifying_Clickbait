With the victory, India completed a hat-trick of Asia Cup titles as they had won the previous one in UAE (2014) and shared the inaugural tournament with Pakistan in Malaysia (2012). India, coached by the batting legend , defeated the hosts by 34 runs in the final. Chasing a 274-run target, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 239 in 48.4 overs. Sri Lanka started the chase in top gear, scoring 27 for no loss in three overs, but soon lost Vishva Chathuranga in the fourth. The wicket did not slow the chase though as Reven Kelly and Hasitha Boyagoda took Sri Lanka to 75/1 after ten overs. The introduction of spinners slowed down the Lankans and while trying to increase the run rate they lost Boyagoda (37) to Abhishek Sharma in the 19th over to be at 105/2. Kelly continued to play solidly and with his captain Kamindu Mendis took Sri Lanka over 150-run mark. But after reaching his fifty, Kelly became the second victim of Sharma in the 31st over. Kelly's watchful knock of 61 came off 101 balls and included a six and five boundaries. The scale kept tilting in favour of the Lankans as Mendis and Krishan Arachchige scored freely, before spinner Rahul Chahar took a brilliant catch off his own bowling to dismiss Arachchige for 14. The hosts' situation worsened with another wicket soon, this time through a run out, to be stranded at 201/5 in the 41st over. Sharma then removed his counterpart Mendis for 53 and made Weerasingha his fourth scalp to finish his spell at 10-1-37-4. Chahar complimented his captain well as he reduced Sri Lanka to 225/9 with a double strike in one over and finished with impressive figures of 3/22 in ten overs. Earlier after electing to bat first, Himanshu Rana and Shubman Gill scored impressive fifties to help India post a competitive total of 273/8.
