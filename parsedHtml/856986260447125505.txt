Bloomberg on Sanctuary Cities: 'The Law Is the Law' - 'You Should Obey the Law' - Breitbart
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I) weighed in on sanctuary cities by arguing that people can’t decide which laws they should obey, and “The law is the law. You should obey the law.” Bloomberg said, “You cannot…have everybody deciding which laws they should obey. The law is the law. You should obey the law. And if you don’t like the law, get your legislative body to change the law, but society breaks down if we can all decide what’s right and what’s wrong. Can’t do that. We have a system of laws, have to live with it.” (h/t Grabien )
