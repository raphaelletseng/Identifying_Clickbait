Bleacher Report's Expert Consensus Free-Agency Predictions
Bleacher Report's Expert Consensus Free-Agency Predictions
Bleacher Report's Expert Consensus Free-Agency Predictions The clearance sale of the year in the NFL is about to begin. On Thursday at 4 p.m. ET, free agency opens across the National Football League. We're already in the midst of the "legal tampering period," where teams can negotiate with players but can't finalize contracts. Just don't think that anyone's paying clearance prices, especially not in the early days of free agency. Teams with cap space to burn are about to dole out hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed coin to the best and brightest pros on the open market—players they hope will put their squads over the hump and into the playoffs. Which of those teams will go on the biggest spending spree, a splurge akin to general manager Jerry Reese's defensive overhaul with the New York Giants last year? Defensive end Olivier Vernon was the big beneficiary of that, landing an $85 million megadeal. Which free agent in 2017 will hit a similar jackpot? Which team will make the shrewdest moves? What lucky player will be the most overpaid? Which deal makes too much sense to happen? And where will some of the bigger-name free agents of 2017 wind up? We've gathered six of the NFL writers here at Bleacher Report to answer those questions and more. Biggest Spenders (4 votes)  There isn't a team in the National Football League with more salary-cap space than the Cleveland Browns. When free agency opens, the Browns will be sitting on a war chest of over $105 million in wiggle room, according to Spotrac . Given the sorry state of the team's roster, that's a good thing—it has holes all over the field. Executive vice president of football operations Sashi Brown cautioned reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis that the Browns won't be aggressive just because they can, but he said they are "going to look at every [opportunity], including free agency, to upgrade our team." The franchise needs those upgrades at more positions than not, so it comes as no surprise it has been mentioned as a potential landing spot for several of this year's biggest free agents. Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports reported recently that many in the league believe Cleveland is the most likely landing spot for quarterback Tyrod Taylor. "League sources said the Browns have significant interest in Taylor as a free agent. Taylor has strong ties to some on the Browns staff already, and if/when he hits the open market, I would be shocked if the Browns don’t make a real push for him," he wrote. "Many in the league believe that's where he will end up. La Canfora also reported the Browns are high on Arizona Cardinals safety Tony Jefferson, who's coming off a career year in the desert. Taylor may well get the biggest contract in all of free agency, and Jefferson isn't going to come cheaply. Add in an extension for wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr. (hopefully), and it's easy to see why it will be hard for other teams to match Cleveland's spending. Especially since only one (the San Francisco 49ers) has anything resembling the Browns' resources this year. If only they could use them wisely for once.  San Francisco 49ers (1 vote); Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1 vote) Most Overpaid Player (3 votes)  This is one of those categories teams would just as soon be mentioned in. I think the players are OK with it. It's a fact of free-agency life. With the salary cap spiking in recent years, teams have money to burn. There is over a dollars of cap space among the NFL's 32 teams in 2017. And that means they are going to overpay some fortunate souls. NFL National Lead Writer Mike Tanier cast his vote for Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson, who may be about to become the highest-paid glorified kick returner in quite some time. "Teams with too much money to spend are going to fall in love with Patterson's eyeball value, post- Norv Turner minisurge and fluky Pro Bowl status," Tanier said. "Patterson will remain a great kickoff returner and screens-and-bombs threat in the slot. But some overenthusiastic team will pay about $12 million a year for it." For this writer, it's Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Mike Glennon. He attempted all of 11 passes over the last two seasons, but soul-searing desperation will lead some squad to see things that just aren't there with the lanky 27-year-old. According to Charles Robinson of Yahoo Sports, multiple league sources think Glennon's next contract will pay him in the neighborhood of $14-15 million a year. However, Kansas City defensive tackle Dontari Poe garnered the most votes. Poe is a two-time Pro Bowler and former No. 11 overall pick, but after tallying 45 tackles and six sacks in 2014, he has only 66 stops and 2.5 sacks in the last two years combined. Poe is a solid young nose tackle. But there's a good chance a team swimming in cap space and hard up in the middle of the line like the 49ers or Washington Redskins will pay him like an elite one.  Mike Glennon, QB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1 vote); Cordarrelle Patterson, WR, Minnesota Vikings (1 vote); Kenny Stills, WR, Miami Dolphins (1 vote) Most Impact-Player Signings (3 votes)  It's the goal of every NFL team. Use cap space wisely and target the players who can help your franchise. And when it's done right, the effect can be drastic. Just look at the New York Giants defense a year ago. Bleacher Report NFL Analyst Brent Sobleski singled out new San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch as a man about to make a big splash in free agency. "While the Cleveland Browns own over $100 million in salary-cap space," he said, "the San Francisco 49ers aren't far behind with over $90 million to spend. What's the difference between these two teams that combined to win three games last season? A fresh start can excite free agents. John Lynch may be a first-time general manager, but he's a well-regarded former player. Plus, new head coach Kyle Shanahan is considered one of the game's premier offensive minds. With wide receiver Alshon Jeffery already linked to the 49ers, a couple more signings could revamp a talent-deficient roster." I want to agree with NFL National Lead Writer Mike Freeman, who thinks the Browns will have the most impactful buying spree. But I wasn't sure if he meant a positive or negative impact, and unfortunately, knowing the Browns' history, I was afraid to ask him. That brings us to the Titans, who nearly made the playoffs in 2016 after a flurry of quality acquisitions last offseason. The franchise is in position to make a similar leap again in 2017, thanks to the fifth-most cap space in the NFL and a pair of first-round picks in the 2017 NFL draft. With over $63 million in cap room, Tennessee has more than enough space to patch holes at wide receiver and cornerback. Or the team can add a pass-rusher and hit those positions in a deep draft in those spots. The Titans may not sign the most free agents. But if they're able to shore up their weaknesses and make a run at an AFC South championship, it will be hard to argue their signings didn't make the biggest dent. Quality over quantity.  Cleveland Browns (1 vote); San Francisco 49ers (1 vote); Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1 vote) Move That Makes Too Much Sense to Happen (2 votes)  Tyrod Taylor is not the best starting quarterback in the NFL. He isn't the fifth-best starting quarterback. He also isn't the fifth-worst starting signal-caller. In fact, he tied Matthew Stafford of the Detroit Lions last year, ranking 10th at the position, per Pro Football Focus . That makes Buffalo's decision to move on from Taylor after two seasons all the more curious. The Bills haven't declined Taylor's option yet, but Vic Carucci of the reported from the combine (via WGRZ.com ) that rumblings are growing the team will release the 27-year-old. However, Jason La Canfora wrote for CBS Sports that new head coach Sean McDermott is lobbying general manager Doug Whaley to reconsider. "McDermott and [owner Terry] Pegula have become close," he said. "McDermott and his staff are not convinced they will find an upgrade over Taylor and see no problem with paying Taylor $17M a year, the sources say." The Bills should listen to their coach. No, Taylor isn't Drew Brees . But he's decent. The Bills' quarterback of the future (outside Taylor) isn't on the roster. This year's draft doesn't have a can't-miss quarterback, and the last time the Bills reached at that spot, they selected EJ Manuel at No. 16 overall. It's unlikely Tony Romo will play out the string in Western New York. And Jay Cutler , Brian Hoyer and Mike Glennon aren't upgrades over Taylor. Sometimes the devil you know is better than the devil you don't. And fixing things that aren't broken isn't going to end Buffalo's long playoff drought.  DeSean Jackson to Patriots (1 vote); DeSean Jackson to Eagles (1 vote); Martellus Bennett to Giants (1 vote); Kevin Zeitler to Miami Dolphins (1 vote) Most Shocking Signing (2 votes)  It's an annual occurrence in free agency. At least one contract will be signed in the next few weeks that will leave jaws agape, whether it's due to the size of the pact or the player and team involved. For NFL Analyst Brad Gagnon, the stunner of free agency in 2017 would be the equivalent of a league unicorn—Green Bay Packers general manager Ted Thompson prying open his checkbook and making a big-money signing. "The Packers actually spent decent money on an outside free agent by signing Jared Cook last offseason, and that paid off," Gagnon said. "Signing Julius Peppers in 2014 also worked out rather well. I wonder if that'll embolden Ted Thompson to take a chance on a lucrative long-term contract for an elite free agent. I know that's not usually how the Packers operate, but they've got money to spend, and pressure is mounting for them to capitalize on Aaron Rodgers ' prime. They can't enter 2017 with the unreliable Damarious Randall and Quinten Rollins slated to start at cornerback, so I'm going out on a limb and predicting they make a splash on a guy like A.J. Bouye." There's no doubt the Packers have a need in the secondary. And given that Bouye could easily command over $11 million a season, a contract of that size would be a rarity in Titletown. The Dallas Cowboys, on the other hand, have been all about splash signings for years. That's why the team has the least cap space in the NFL. Dallas will get quite a bit of relief if/when it releases Tony Romo, and it will no doubt get creative to add more. The shell game in Big D is another annual tradition in free agency. The Cowboys have more pressing needs than at wide receiver, but the acquisition of Brandon Marshall would give Dallas one of the most imposing wideout trios in the NFL—coupled with the game's best offensive line and the NFL's 2016 rushing king in . Now, admittedly, this isn't the most likely of scenarios. A landing spot like Baltimore seems a much more obvious fit for Marshall, and Jeff Zrebiec of the wrote the Ravens are expected to at least kick the tires on the soon-to-be 33-year-old. But this category is most signing, and no one has dropped more jaws in the offseason over the past 20 years than Jerruh Jones.  Brandon Marshall to Ravens (1 vote); A.J. Bouye to Packers (1 vote), DeMarcus Ware to Cowboys (1 vote); Mike Glennon to New York Jets (1 vote) Biggest Steal (3 votes)  If our writers are correct, it's could be a frustrating offseason for Green Bay Packers GM Ted Thompson. One year after watching Casey Hayward lead the NFL in interceptions after leaving the Packers for the San Diego Chargers, four of the six scribes who voted singled out a Green Bay free agent-to-be as the biggest steal of 2017. For NFL Analyst Sean Tomlinson, tailback Eddie Lacy has value written all over him. "Sure, there's still plenty of concern surrounding Eddie Lacy because of the weight issues he had to claw back from and the ankle surgery that limited him to only five games in 2016," he said. "But those concerns start to matter so very little, or fade away altogether, with the cellar-dwelling contracts that annually greet running backs on the open market." "Suddenly, then, Lacy has high steal potential if we focus on what he did during his few games in 2016 rather than just on the missed time. Lacy averaged 5.1 yards per attempt over his 71 carries and recorded a run for 25-plus yards in four of his five games. It was a brief flash cut short by injury, but for a time, he started to look like the old Lacy again." However, one of Lacy's teammates received the most nods. Micah Hyde has been a defensive Swiss army knife for the Packers, playing all over the field at both cornerback and safety. Hyde told Rob Demovsky of ESPN.com that he feels his versatility brings a lot to the table for potential suitors. "Maybe there's a couple of guys who can play any position in the secondary," Hyde said. "But if you put all that together, no one's back there returning punts, returning kickoffs or being the fullback on the punt team. That's why my confidence is at an all-time high." Hyde's going to get paid more than Hayward was in 2016 ($1 million base salary), especially with safeties who can play the slot all the rage in today's NFL. But if Hyde continues to improve and approaches Hayward's success in 2017, he'll still be a huge bargain.  Kenny Britt, WR, Los Angeles Rams (2 votes); Eddie Lacy, RB, Green Bay Packers (1 vote); Logan Ryan, CB, New England Patriots (1 vote) Alshon Jeffery Landing Spot 4 votes  It's fact time. Fact: The San Francisco 49ers have the most cap space of any team in the NFC—over $98 million, to be exact. Fact: The Niners have a bigger need at wide receiver than any team on Earth. This is a club that just re-upped Jeremy Kerley and that's a thing. As such, it's hardly a surprise that some are already connecting dots between the Niners and the player most people believe to be the best free agent at the position in 2017. Per Benjamin Allbright of 104.7 FM in Denver, the 49ers are expected to make a "serious run" at Jeffery. Josina Anderson  Whether it's wise to sink big money into a wide receiver who has battled injuries and hasn't had a 1,000-yard season since 2014 (and picked up a performance-enhancing drug suspension last year) is another question altogether. But the 49ers aren't in a position to be overly picky, and if Jeffery can stay healthy, he'd make the San Francisco pass-catching corps exponentially better.  Tennessee Titans (2 votes) Dont'a Hightower Landing Spot (3 votes)  The Patriot Way is about to be tested again. After trading away both Chandler Jones and Jamie Collins last year, it was thought that New England would make every effort to retain the services of its last remaining front seven stalwart. However, the Pats were unable to agree to terms on a long-term deal with inside linebacker Dont'a Hightower and elected not to apply the franchise tag to the 26-year-old. With Hightower about to hit the open market, he's been mentioned as a fit with around 32 teams. Elliot Harrison of NFL.com highlighted the Colts as an especially good one. "The Colts must rebuild the defense straight up the middle," Harrison wrote, "and have the dollars to do so." To say that the Colts need help at inside linebacker is an understatement. The team ranked 25th in run defense last year, and it parted ways with D'Qwell Jackson, its leading tackler in the linebacking corps, in February. With almost $58 million in cap space, the Colts can easily afford the big contract Hightower will command. And given that perfect storm of need meets resources if Hightower leaves Beantown, it's easy to see it being for a short trip west... And a whole bunch of money.  Miami Dolphins (1 vote); New England Patriots (1 vote); Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1 vote) Adrian Peterson Landing Spot  Running back Adrian Peterson wants one thing to be clear. Despite being 31 years old and coming off a career-low 72 rushing yards in 2016, he is not "done." As Andre Vergara wrote for Fox Sports, Peterson recently uploaded a video of himself working out on social media, including the caption, "not on a decline, rather an incline!" Peterson also appears to have indicated an interest in playing in the Big Apple, posting on Twitter last month that, "The Giants been making some interesting moves" after Big Blue released veteran tailback Rashad Jennings. Given how the Jennings signing worked out for the Giants, many fans of the team likely aren't blown away by the notion of burning precious cap space on a player the wrong side of 30 with fewer than 100 rushing yards in two of the last three seasons. However, the Giants do need running back help, and the free-agent class at the position is soft. GM Jerry Reese showed last year he isn't averse to getting aggressive in free agency, and Peterson has proved his doubters wrong in a big way before. With the Giants in win-now mode given Eli Manning's age (36), if they could get even one year of the Adrian Peterson who will one day be enshrined in Canton, Ohio... Well, Big Blue were a playoff team last year despite ranking 29th in the NFL in rushing. You do the math.  Cleveland Browns (1 vote); Detroit Lions (1 vote); Minnesota Vikings (1 vote); Oakland Raiders (1 vote) Terrelle Pryor Landing Spot (3 votes)  The Cleveland Browns raised a few eyebrows across the NFL when they chose not to franchise-tag wide receiver Terrelle Pryor. After all, the team can afford it, and Pryor was easily the Browns' best offensive weapon during a miserable 2016 season. To hear GM Sashi Brown tell it, Cleveland is prepared to let Pryor go if the numbers aren't right. "We'd like to have Terrelle back, and that's a priority for us," Brown said, Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com . "That said, we're not going to panic if he's not back, also. But he's a good player, works hard, we think he fits in our system, had a lot of success with our coaches, so we think this is a great place for him to continue his career." This gambit is baffling. With over $100 million in cap room and no other player worth tagging, the Browns could have avoided the possibility of Pryor's leaving and made him back up his career season before shelling out $25-plus million in guarantees. It's possible this will blow up in the team's face. It's the Browns, so it wouldn't be surprising. But Pryor has indicated a desire to stay in Cleveland, per Cabot , and the team has more cabbage than any franchise in the National Football League. So it's possible the Browns might know what they're doing here. I wouldn't count on it, but stranger things have happened.  , San Francisco 49ers (1 vote); Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1 vote); Tennessee Titans (1 vote) Calais Campbell Landing Spot (2 votes)  Make no mistake. The Arizona Cardinals don't want veteran defensive end Calais Campbell to leave town. However, after applying the franchise tag to outside linebacker Chandler Jones, the team is staring at some harsh financial realities. Sure enough, per Kent Somers of the , word at the combine was the Redbirds will likely lose both Campbell and safety Tony Jefferson to free agency this year. According to Paul Gutierrez of ESPN.com , one of the Raiders' first calls in the legal tampering period should be to Campbell, especially with the Raiders set to feature more three-man defensive fronts in 2017. "Imagine, then," he wrote, "the Raiders going after Calais Campbell and all-in with a 3-4 defensive alignment, with Campbell and Mack at the ends and Bruce Irvin and Aldon Smith at outside linebackers. "Even in a 4-3, Campbell, who has averaged seven sacks for the Arizona Cardinals since 2009 and had eight sacks last season along with three fumble recoveries and six pass deflections, could play inside. He also has had at least 48 QB pressures in each of the past four seasons, per Pro Football Focus." For the first time in a long time, the Raiders are in a position to be players in free agency, sporting over $44 million in cap space. That's more than enough to acquire Campbell, who would be frightening lined up opposite Khalil Mack.  Seattle Seahawks (2 votes); Denver Broncos (1 vote); Indianapolis Colts (1 vote) Most Guaranteed Money (3 votes)  We'll wrap this article up with the biggest individual beneficiary of free agency. The proverbial lottery winner. The player who brings home the most guaranteed money. Two writers here at Bleacher Report, including NFL National Lead Writer Mike Freeman (and myself), believe the QB fever that grips the league will lead to Mike Glennon hitting the jackpot. "Mike Glennon isn't any good," Freeman said, "and there's a good chance he'll be Osweilerian, but teams are so desperate for quarterbacks he'll get big money." "Osweilerian?" Man, that hurts. However, the player who received the most votes seems an even bigger long shot to strike it rich—at least relative to where he was a season ago. At this point a year ago, A.J. Bouye was just a guy a sub-package cornerback for the Houston Texans who played fewer than 200 regular-season snaps in 2015. However, injuries thrust the 25-year-old into a starting role this year, and Bouye didn't look back. The four-year veteran finished 2016 with career highs in combined tackles (63) and passes defensed (16) en route to a top-10 ranking at his position from PFF . As Albert Breer wrote for The MMQB, one AFC executive thinks that season is about to translate into one whopper of a payday. "What did Janoris Jenkins get again?" he said. "Bouye will be the clear king of the class, assuming the guys we believe will be franchised actually are." For those of you wondering (I know you were), Jenkins' deal with the New York Giants a year ago was for $62.5 million over five years, almost $29 million of which was guaranteed. It's good work if you can get it.  Mike Glennon, QB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2 votes); Dont'a Hightower, ILB, New England Patriots (1 vote)  Like the new article format? Send us feedback !
