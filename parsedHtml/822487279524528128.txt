Inauguration Day: Live Coverage
Inauguration Day: Live Coverage
Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Welcome! We will starting our live analysis and coverage of the inauguration ceremonies starting around 10 a.m. Friday morning. Please check back then to join us.   Morrigan McCarthy    Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Welcome to our Trump inauguration coverage. We’ll be following all of the action across the capital today, with input and analysis from our correspondents who are scattered across Washington.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  We’ve also got some special guests to join us, such as the historian Jon Meacham to put all of this in perspective. Welcome, Jon!   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  At the moment Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, are arriving at the White House where President Obama and Michelle Obama are greeting him.     Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Mrs. Trump gave Mrs. Obama a kiss on both cheeks and presented her with a gift. It appears to be from Tiffany.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  After a quick photo-op, inside they go for coffee.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Good morning. The consensus at the Capitol is that the crowd arriving for the ceremonies is much smaller than the past few inaugurations, particularly President Obama’s first in 2009.   Morrigan McCarthy  From Lincoln to Obama, How Crowds at the Capitol Have Been Counted People have descended on Washington to witness, celebrate and protest for 150 years. Here’s how we’ve estimated the size of the crowds. The New York Times   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Good morning folks, it’s great to be here with you.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, have just arrived.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  I’m duplicating Twitter here, but Melania Trump is channeling Jackie Kennedy with her powder-blue dress and fitted suit jacket over it.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Good morning on a remarkable day. This is the first time since George Washington took the oath at Federal Hall in New York in April 1789 that a president without political or military experience will assume ultimate power. So, in a way, an unprecedented day.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Jon, this was also a strikingly acrimonious campaign.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  The  greeting between the Trumps and the Obamas was slightly awkward in terms of the body language.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump has, for five years, questioned the legitimacy of Obama’s presidency by falsely insisting he may not have been born in the United States.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  It’s remarkable watching the two of them with their arms around each other.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  This won’t be the first time Donald Trump has spoken on the West Front of the Capitol, though obviously not in such a setting.   Back in September 2015, he joined a rally there with Sarah Palin and others against the Iran nuclear deal. It was seen at the time as a sign of the seriousness of his political intentions.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  On the birther and body language point, Maggie, I’ve heard for a year and a half that Mrs. Obama was even more worried about Trump than the president was – a concern driven by how Mr. Trump’s conspiracy theories fomented paranoia and hatred toward her husband. So it’s a miracle that it wasn’t even more awkward out there – and a tribute to the Obamas’ grace.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon, two of Trump’s top aides, just arrived at the Capitol.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Bannon wearing a suit, no less.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Conway is looking very patriotic, wearing a red, white and blue dress.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  And Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser, has just arrived.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  We’re about an hour and a half away from the swearing-in ceremony.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  One person who will have a starring role today probably won’t be too well known to most Americans. Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, will serve as master of ceremonies. He is the chairman of the inauguration committee by virtue of being chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. He survived a tough re-election last year against a strong Democratic challenger.  Told me yesterday he wasn’t worried about a thing.   Morrigan McCarthy    Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  And Senator Blunt is a big history buff; he and I once had a long conversation about Andrew Jackson, so I bet this is fun for him.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Mr.  Blunt’s role is also why you will be hearing from the Missouri State University Chorale later! Power has its privileges.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Ah, politics. When Senator Chuck Schumer did the job, we had a lot of New York bands.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Chuck Schumer is on the program as well. He will deliver remarks and introduce Justice Clarence Thomas to swear in Mike Pence.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  One thing I would say about Trump’s speech – which a senior adviser told me is expected to be anchored in the Jacksonian tradition – it won’t necessarily tell us about the type of president he will be. For that I would look to what has come before. But it will tell us about how he views his place in the canon of U.S. history.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Former Speaker John Boehner on hand.  He has a relationship with Donald Trump. And they both love golf.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Newt and Callista Gingrich are also making their way. A reunion of former House speakers.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Boehner was an original member of the leadership with Newt Gingrich after the 1994 Republican takeover.  Boehner was knocked out in 1998, as was Gingrich, but was able to bounce back.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Maggie, on the Jackson point: I think this is all coming from Steve Bannon. You know the new president vastly better than I do, but I talked history with him in May 2016 and Jackson never came up. The only role model Trump cited then was Ronald Reagan, and that was only in passing. What strikes me most about today is that the new president truly sees himself as singular figure.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Newt and Callista are talking to Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  As our readers may recall, Adelson essentially kept Gingrich’s campaign for president alive in 2012. And Gingrich was Adelon’s preferred secretary of state.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Jon, there is no question this is coming from Bannon.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  For all of the understandable criticism of Bannon, he is also the only person around Trump besides Pence with a deep sense of U.S. history and the presidency.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump sees himself as singular, and for many reasons.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  But Trump has also really liked the comparisons that some of his aides - mostly Bannon and Kellyanne Conway - have made of his rise to Jackson’s rise.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Bob Dole is arriving now.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Good morning all. Among the dignitaries arriving now are members of the clergy. Trump has more clergy praying for him in this inauguration than any previous president. Trump has six, outdoing Nixon, who had five.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  This has already been a divisive morning, faith-wise. The featured preacher at the service Trump attended today at St. John’s Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House, was the Rev. Robert Jeffress. He’s a Southern Baptist from Dallas who has condemned Mormons, Muslims and gays in very vitriolic language, and said that Obama has paved the way for the Antichrist.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Bill Frist and Trent Lott, two former Republican Senate leaders, also on hand.  Frist, from Tennessee, was Senate leader the last time Republicans controlled the entire government in 2006.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Hillary Clinton just emerged from a black Lincoln with Bill at the Capitol.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Clearly a difficult day for them.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  It is really surreal watching Hillary Clinton walk in.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  And it will be significant to watch how Trump deals with her presence, which I suspect may make him uncomfortable.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  It just has to be so difficult for her to be going through this.  Hard to imagine. But she also is aware that is part of her role.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  All former presidents and first ladies are invited to inaugurations and there were some questions about whether they would attend.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Knowing Trump, he will make some reference to how hard she fought and what a competitor she is.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  I can’t imagine how painful this is for her, Carl. But you’re right that she knows this is what’s expected and not doing it would send a signal she might regret.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  It appears that the rain is holding off for now. Trump joked last night that rain wouldn’t be so bad because it would prove his hair is real.   Morrigan McCarthy    Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  While Representative John Lewis made headlines for saying he does not consider Trump a legitimate president, he was elected legitimately, and Clinton herself has said that.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Mrs. Clinton definitely wants to show she can rise above it.  The presidential loser often has to share the inaugural stage.  Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Al Gore ….   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  On Jackson again: The moment is clearly Jacksonian, in that Jackson was the first president of his kind–the first one who was neither a Virginia planter nor an Adams from Massachusetts. But Jackson had been a judge, a senator, a general, and had run for president before. He had a temper and could be erratic, but he knew how to control himself and leveraged those skills in negotiations. To me the key question for the new president is whether he will be able to do the same.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Yes, Jon, Trump’s lack of grounding in government or public service is completely outside the norm.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  And I don’t know what it will translate into.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Dan Quayle!   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  On the Cheneys, remember this is a small dynastic moment for them: Liz is now a Wyoming member of Congress, nearly half a century since her dad came to Washington and 40 years since he became the youngest White House chief of staff, at age 34.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  I agree that this is a moment for the Cheneys.  You will remember that Liz first wanted to run for Senate, but ran into a buzzsaw of opposition and support for the incumbent, Mike Enzi.  Now in the House, her ascension to the Senate will have to wait.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Jon, I wrote a piece that ran on Election Day about how hard it is to lose a political race, almost like a death. At the time, I thought I was writing a piece about how Trump, who’d never lost a race, would handle this.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  How wrong I was.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  After losing to Bill Clinton in 1996, Senator Dole walked over to George McGovern, who had lost to Nixon in 1972. “George, when does it stop hurting?” McGovern’s reply: “I’ll let you know.”   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Just saw Nikki Haley. To those who criticize her lack of global experience, I commend a small story from the life of Bush 41. After Bush lost to Lloyd Bentsen in the 1970 Senate race, Nixon nominated Bush for the United Nations. “George, what the [expletive deleted] do you know about foreign policy?” one of his oldest friends, the Democratic congressman Lud Ashley, asked him. “Ask me in two weeks,” Bush replied.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  House members are arriving at the Capitol.  Republicans are jubilant, while Democrats are bracing for a difficult two years but hope they can bounce back in 2018.  Midterms are when there is typically a backlash to the party in power.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump and Obama should be departing the White House shortly to make their way to the Capitol together.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The crowd is starting to fill in across the National Mall. Officials are expecting around 900,000 people coming to Washington for the main event. That’s about half as many as the 2009 inauguration.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  In 1981, on “the ride” from the White House to the Capitol, Jimmy Carter, who was exhausted from last-minute negotiations on the hostages in Iran, had little to say to Reagan. Reagan, who hated silence, started telling Hollywood stories. When Carter got out of the limo at the Capitol, he asked Gerald Rafshoon, his communications director: “Who the hell is Jack Warner? He keeps talking about Jack Warner.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  A bunch of familiar faces are showing up on the C-Span feed, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; a former Trump campaign adviser, Rick Gates; and the House GOP leadership.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The makeup of the crowd looks to be more reflective of Trump’s supporters, more white and less diverse than the last two inaugurations.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Crowd counts are always problematic and the National Park Service doesn’t want to make one. But from my own experience at these - this is my 7th - I think they will be hard pressed to hit 900,000.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Omarosa Manigault, Trump’s first-season “Apprentice” star, just arrived.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  She’s been given an amorphous job in the White House, one in the office of public liaison. She has privately told people she is the next Valerie Jarrett. However, she is not, and the number of people around Trump describing themselves that way is not small.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  According to a White House pool report that was just released, President Obama has left a letter to Trump in the Oval Office. That is in keeping with the tradition of presidents offering well wishes and advice to their successors.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Senate members are arriving on the platform.  There are some hard feelings between Republicans and Democrats right now over the pace of Cabinet confirmations.  Republicans are unhappy that only two - defense secretary and secretary of homeland security - will be confirmed today.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Bernie Sanders and John McCain walk down the stairs simultaneously.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  When Reagan left Bush 41 his note in 1989, Reagan used cartoon notepaper with the caption: “Don’t Let the Turkeys Get You Down.”   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Also the tea reception that is happening at the White House right now is not just Obama and Trump having a final chat. There are 20 people there, including the Republican and Democratic leadership.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Jon, that memory of Bush 41 is poignant. I quoted from Bush 41’s diary entries about the pain of being wrong about the polls after his loss in that story. I tried to interview Michael Dukakis, who I think has gotten weary of giving those types of interviews and declined. Dole talked about losing when he was on the ticket as vice president and Hubert Humphrey buying him ice cream and giving him a pep talk.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Sean Spicer, the incoming press secretary, chewing gum as he is led down the stairs.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  House Democrats are wearing buttons with  #ProtectOurCare in support of the Affordable Care Act.  Of course Republican determination to repeal the Obama administration’s signature law is the first big fight of the Trump era.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Does anyone know what was in the Tiffany box that the Trumps brought to the Obamas? I’m betting a picture frame. Who’s in?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  It was also a slightly awkward moment when the president stepped away to hand it off to someone, leaving him briefly absent from such a momentous occasion.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Jon, we don’t know what was in the box, although the internet is going wild with guesses.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump will love every aspect of this day. He is tremendously focused on aesthetics and people looking the part. I’m really curious how he reacts to being on Air Force One the first time, when he discovers it isn’t like it’s portrayed in the movies.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Trump just left the White House together.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Notable that there are just eight Supreme Court justices on hand.  Republicans blocked the nomination of Merrick Garland to replace Antonin Scalia, infuriating Democrats. Now there is likely to be a huge court fight beginning next month.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  The look on Michelle Obama’s face as she is escorting Melania Trump is not happy.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  And here is Trump and Obama. Trump clapped as they walked out. Obama gave a salute.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  It’s worth reminding our readers that Melania Trump plagiarized portions of Mrs. Obama’s D.N.C. speech in her own R.N.C. address.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  I agree, Maggie, that she did not look thrilled.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  On the Presidents’ Club front (hat tip: Nancy Gibbs and Mike Duffy’s amazing book): There will be five presidents on the platform after the oath: Trump, Obama, Bush 43, Clinton, Carter. Last time five were together was opening of Bush 43’s library in Dallas: Carter, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, Obama. Before that, opening of Reagan library: Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush 41.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  And now Obama has left the White House for the last time.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  (as president)   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Hillary Clinton also does not look thrilled.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  You really can see her steeling herself for this.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Obviously the Obamas did not want their tenure to end this way.  But I think they are also looking forward to being free of some of the restrictions of the White House and getting on with their lives.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Carl, I totally agree with you.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Fortune has truly smiled on Mike Pence.  He was in trouble in his own re-election for governor in Indiana and in minutes will become the vice president of the United States.   Morrigan McCarthy    Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Worth recalling that the larger role of vice presidents is a fairly recent historical development, largely because tragedy and scandal brought several to power after Dallas and Watergate. Walter Mondale was really the first fully-involved vice president, followed by Bush, Gore, Cheney, Biden and now Pence. Much more prominent office than the days when John Nance Garner (“Cactus Jack”) under F.D.R. said it wasn’t worth “a bucket of warm [spit].”   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  As for Obama, remember how young (and healthy) he is–he’s just 55. If he lives as long as Ford or Bush 41, he could have another 40 years!   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  It is going to be different to have the outgoing president remaining so visible in Washington.  Big question is just how visible he will be. But I don’t expect him to be a wallflower.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  More on the loss of elections: After Nixon lost to Kennedy in 1960, he stood late one night at the Capitol, looked at the view west, and told himself, “I will be back.” I don’t think Hillary can do that, and there’s an element of human tragedy there.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Jimmy Carter and his wife just made their way to the main platform.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Carter became president a biblical 40 years ago today.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  In some ways, Hillary’s day will be tomorrow in Washington when tens of thousands of women take to the streets to protest Trump’s election and lament her loss.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Hillary Clinton just shared a bit more about her feelings on Twitter, explaining that she is honoring America’s democracy today.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  I’m here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values. I will never stop believing in our country & its future. #Inauguration — Hillary Clinton on Twitter ( hillaryclinton )   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump is about to be surrounded by former presidents who not only did not support him, but ran against him and, in the case of his own party, signaled that they felt that he was a danger to the democracy.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Jimmy Carter is still teaching Sunday school at his Baptist church in Georgia, and leading an initiative on racial reconciliation.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Bill and Hillary Clinton make their way down the blue carpet to the platform, smiling.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  I’ve been to President Carter’s Sunday school class in Plains; highly recommend the trip. It’s a fascinating global and theological tour d'horizon at Maranatha Baptist Church.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  KellyAnne Conway is in @Gucci for #InaugurationDay - she called the red white and blue coat “Trump revolutionary wear. — Elizabeth Paton on Twitter ( lizziepaton )   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Our colleague Elizabeth Paton, who covers fashion from London, has some details about Conway’s dress, which is getting lots of attention. It’s made by Gucci and she referred to it as “Trump Revolutionary wear”.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  One thing that we should mention in terms of the Trump-Clinton relationship - Trump savaged Clinton and subjected her to next-level humiliations by parading her husband’s accusers at a debate.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  That said, she ran an epically bad campaign, replete with bad decisions by advisers and of her own. It was clear to me in 2013 that something was off, as she engaged a striking sweep of highly paid speeches, in a year when income inequality was the dominant issue for Democrats.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  She’s now surrounded by Democrats at this swearing-in who privately blame her for losing, even as they condemn the alleged interference of a foreign government through the email hacks.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Does anyone know if Comey is at inauguration?   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Worth thinking about: A farmer from Plains; a kid from Arkansas; a scion of a great family; a fatherless mixed-race law professor from Hawaii; and now a child of Queens. Can’t say we don’t have a biographically diverse collection of (male) presidents.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  I have not seen Comey, but I have missed a number of these arrivals.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  My colleague Matt Rosenberg, who is covering the protests, reports that violent protests have broken out in downtown Washington near Franklin Square.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The first signs of violence: Protesters broke shop windows in downtown Washington. A Bank of America branch had all its windows shattered, and a Starbucks was left with a gaping hole in its glass front door. Police in riot helmets moved in quickly, using pepper spray to break up groups of protesters, who spread out and kept breaking windows. What exactly they were protesting was not clear – a witness said they saw a lot of black anarchist symbols, and most of protesters appeared to be young men.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  And here are the current president and the soon-to-be president.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Bittersweet for President Obama  as he arrives on the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol.  He served there himself but Senate Republicans led by Mitch McConnell were able to thwart so much of his agenda the past six years.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The Trump family is making its way. Ivanka and Tiffany are wearing bright white.     Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  The Trump adult children look a little nervous, understandably.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Don Jr. is wearing a double breasted coat and Eric is dressed in a dark suit and red tie, similar to what his father tends to wear.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Maggie, any reporting on why Trump never buttons his suit coat?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Mr. Trump’s youngest son, Barron, is also in attendance. He will be finishing his school year in New York this year before moving to Washington.   Morrigan McCarthy    Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  This was apparently done by anarchists, according to our colleague Sopan Deb. Somebody spray-painted the letter “A” with a circle around it on the wall here, apparently an anarchist symbol.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Another thought about the platform: Every politician up there, from the most obscure House member to Hillary Clinton, is, as Albert Gore Sr., once told me, looking at the presidents and wondering, “Why not me?”   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Jon, the old line is that every senator looks in a mirror and sees a president.  But few make it.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Yes indeed, Carl. And remember the other old congressional joke: You spend the first year wondering how you got there, and then the rest of your career wondering how everybody else did.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The aerial shots of the Mall seem to show a relatively sparse crowd so far, but there is still about 30 minutes until Trump actually takes the oath.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump’s sister Maryanne, a federal judge, is there. Trump also has another sister who is never talked about, Elizabeth, whom I know little about.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Michelle Obama would do well to remember there is a camera on her, methinks.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  If you’ll indulge this Bush 41 biographer: He opened his address in 1989 with a prayer of his own composition: “Help us, Lord, to use power to help people.” A worthy prayer for today and – come to think of it – every day.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Maggie, a question: Is Joe Biden thinking he should be taking the oath today?   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Jon, I think absolutely.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Mrs. Obama looks very unhappy throughout.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Although perhaps she doesn’t really care - she is fiercely protective of her husband and was deeply angered by the birtherism, as you noted, Jon.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Jon, I think Biden deeply regrets not running. And he did it after some intervention from Obama.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Can’t help but love that Bernie Sanders and John McCain are hanging out together.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  I think there are many Americans who also think Joe Biden should be taking the oath and could have mounted a better campaign.  But as Maggie said, the White House was not enthusiastic at all about such a run. And it would have been a difficult primary with Hillary Clinton.  His previous runs were not strong.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Iris Weinshall, Chuck Schumer’s wife and the former transportation commissioner in New York City, just entered.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Our colleague Yamiche Alcindor reports that some people on the lawn by the Capitol shouted, “Lock her up,” as large screens broadcast Mrs. Clinton sitting on stage.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Melania Trump is being escorted outside to the platform now.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  It looks like things are about 20 minutes behind schedule right now.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  I am struck by how much more solemn this ritual seems than it typically does.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  What is the button Nancy Pelosi is wearing?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Obama and Biden are walking down the steps together. Obama looks pretty serene and just whispered something to his VP.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  I agree with Maggie on the tone.  This is missing some of the celebratory air of past inaugurations.  Everyone seems a bit tense.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  I think she’s wearing a button about saving health care.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  The one that Carl mentioned earlier.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  For Trump, this is going to be a moment of enormous victory.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Schumer, Pelosi, Biden and Obama are all making their way to the platform.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump views life through heroes and villains, just not of a historical nature, but rather in his own life. And he will come to that podium having proven an enormous number of people wrong.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Obama just reached out and gave Hillary Clinton a handshake.   Hamilton Boardman Editor  ‘Hail to the Chief’: The Musical Strains of Presidential Power Jimmy Carter shunned it. A first lady demanded that it be played to draw notice to her husband, a president of “small stature.” Here’s a brief history of the tune. The New York Times   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Our colleague David Sanger is on the mall and reports a thin crowd. He says that there are very short security lines - as a comparison, much shorter than those at an average day at the airport.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Cheers of “Trump” are heard loudly from the crowd.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump is walking down the hall alone behind Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. He looks stone faced.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  If Trump isn’t humbled by this spectacle as well as thrilled, we’re in trouble.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  In talking to some of the longtime aides to Mike Pence over the past few days, even they find the sequence of events that led him being here as surreal.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  The tone is going to be, as I said, less significant in terms of what Trump will do going forward, but how he sees himself in history.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Quick overcoat story. In 1989, Bush told his aide, Tim McBride, to leave his overcoat in the car. Then Bush, in the Capitol, realized that Reagan was bundled up. Not wanting to show up the president by appearing to be sporty when the president was in a heavy coat, Bush told McBride to get his coat – but it was too late. So Bush put on McBride’s and walked down the steps.   Morrigan McCarthy    Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  I just thought of part of the last line of Robert Penn Warren’s “All the King’s Men”: Now he is “walking out of History, into History, and the awful responsibility of Time.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  This is a daunting moment for every president. But Trump is the first with no previous experience in government.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump just stared right into the camera and gave a little wink.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump also just mouthed something into the camera.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Dark overcoat, red tie. Classic Trump.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Jon, I’d stick more to Redford in “The Candidate” in the final scene.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Pence makes his way down the steps shakes hands.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Mike Pence: The Establishment’s insurance policy.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Trump is a man who likes control and even though he is about to become president, this is an extremely choreographed ceremony.  Not what he is used to, I don’t think.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Here we go. Trump is making his way down.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  He gives a thumbs up as he walks, then stops and pumps his fist to the crowd.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Always with the full name at the inauguration. Donald John Trump.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  He gave Mrs. Obama a kiss and shakes hands with Obama  and Biden.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  This is closest Trump and Hillary Clinton have been to each other since their final debate. He did not greet her.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  No handshake for Clintons. Bad form, methinks. Good manners cost nothing and can win you everything.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Yes, Jon, that is striking.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  And in his mind I’m sure he thinks it’s justified. But it is telling about the future.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Roy Blunt is a very rare lawmaker - he has been in top leadership posts in both the House and Senate.   Morrigan McCarthy    Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  This is the Transitive Property Presidency. Trump does not care much about conventions and proper form, and millions of people voted for him, so therefore they don’t care either about proper form/no one cares about proper form.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  That is the process of thought. Not judging it, just describing it.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Blunt talking about 1801, 1865, 1933. Pretty dramatic allusions–a sign that the subtext of division may not be all that sub.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Yes, very good point.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, just called up for the invocation, did publicly take Trump to task in an editorial during the campaign for bashing immigrants. He is reading from the Book of Wisdom, where King Solomon prays to God for guidance to lead Israel.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Love Cardinal Dolan. Word has always been that he was not far behind Francis in the last papal conclave.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  There are cardinals far closer to Pope Francis than Cardinal Dolan. But Dolan is the one who’s summoned to pray at the Republican and Democratic conventions. He’s also speaking at the anti-abortion March for Life next week.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Rev. Samuel Rodriguez told me he had been for Jeb Bush, then Marco Rubio. He was invited to join Trump’s evangelical advisory board, and told me he refused.  But he’s really gotten on board since the election.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Back to our discussion from earlier about Jackson versus other presidents - Trump is not only singular, he had language that bordered on authoritarian during the campaign at many points.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  How he controls those impulses is a real open question. But remember, he is cinematically obsessed with the visuals of a strong media. That is not how this country functions typically.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  To Maggie’s point, Eleanor Roosevelt worried that, in 1933, the crowd responded more fervently to F.D.R.‘s saying he might need emergency powers in the Depression than it did to his language of unity.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  One thing lacking from the program is a poem. I think that had become a fairly standard element in recent inaugurations.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  The pastor who is speaking now, Paula White-Cain, is very controversial.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  You’re right, Maggie. A lot of evangelicals have condemned Paula White-Cain because she’s associated with “prosperity gospel” preaching. Those are the televangelists who say, if you send me money, God will bless you. Paula has been trying to distance herself from this camp recently. Of all the clergy here today, she is by far the closest to him personally, having known him, she said, for 15 years.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  One thing is certain about the presidency, even more so than in other realms of life: style is substance. The glower, the tangents, the solipsism, the obsession with red-and-blue maps: They will all mean even more in about 10 minutes.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Nobody read from Two Corinthians.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  But the joke about “Two Corinthians walking into a bar” has been told on Twitter repeatedly.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  In terms of Trump, we should also point out the degree to which his slash-and-burn style has continued throughout his transition, and it’s taken a toll on his approval ratings.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  For the historical background of the religious elements of the ceremony, I recommend Robert Bellah’s classic essay “Civil Religion in America.” Go read it.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Unusual, though not unprecedented, to pray publicly the “In the Name of Jesus Christ.” Most ministers tend to more deist language in such settings.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  He is entering with the lowest approval rating of any president.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  It is going to be very, very hard for him to get those numbers lifted. And if there is one thing Trump cares about, it’s his numbers.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump has a serious problem keeping still, as well. According to a source who was watching a different feed, Trump didn’t bow his head or close his eyes during the prayer.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump is also not particularly religious.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Jon, as for the hand-shaking with the Clintons, it’s very possible that he is nervous and simply forgot.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Maybe, but we’re now paying him not to be nervous in such moments.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Trump may not be personally religious, but he succeeded in surrounding himself with pastors who prayed over him and turned out their flocks to vote for him.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  This is the Missouri State University chorale performing right now.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Senator Schumer is up to make some remarks.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  He bemoans “a politics, frequently consumed by rancor.”   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Schumer’s remarks seem highly unusual to me. Can’t remember similar moments in previous years. Am I wrong?   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Senator Schumer invokes “fractured media” and divisions of the moment.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  I don’t think you are wrong about Schumer’s remarks. Very striking to me. Typically, the divisions are sort of pushed into the background.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  This is really striking to me too.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  I really can’t recall another instance of an opposition politician offering wide-ranging remarks on the nature of the country and the issues of the hour. Schumer is offering a full homily on unity.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  This is like a prebuttal, reminding Trump that the office is bigger than the person sitting in it.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Schumer has presided over a previous inaugural, so he knew he would have an opportunity to make a strong statement.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Justice Clarence Thomas is about to swear-in Pence.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Pence said he will take the oath on the Reagan family bible, which President Reagan used in his inaugurations. Pence said he would have it open to the passage in II Chronicles 7:14, which begins, “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and pray…”   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Thomas rarely speaks publicly.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  When Reagan was inaugurated, the Bible was opened to the Chronicles passage about how the people should turn to God, and if so He would prosper and bless them.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Less than 10 minutes left in the Obama presidency, for those interested.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Paul Ryan looks very happy for his friend right now.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Impossible to underestimate how much momentum Pence gave to Trump’s campaign among religious conservatives. It was a brilliant choice.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Justice Thomas, in private, is great company. Very funny and interested in history and theology. Spends as little time in Washington as possible; he and his wife drive an RV around the country when the court is not in session.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Yes, Laurie, Pence was an inspired choice. The person who championed that selection was Paul Manafort, with the help of Kellyanne Conway.   Hamilton Boardman Editor  ‘This Is Our Right’: Protests Erupt in Washington With Mission to Disrupt A resistance has descended on Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, prompting police officers, some in riot gear, to employ crowd-dispersing sprays. The New York Times   Hamilton Boardman Editor  Cannot overstate contrast between the calm ceremony at the Capitol and the feeling in the streets. — jodikantor on Twitter ( jodikantor )   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Here comes the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to sing “America the Beautiful.”   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  The choir is the pride of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but some members didn’t want to sing for Trump. Mormons tend to vote Republican, but Trump alienated some of them.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  They are quite good, if I may say, and always are.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Always moved by the line: “Who more than self their country loved…in liberating strife.”   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Mr. Trump is using two Bibles for his swearing-in: one his mother gave him and the same Bible used by President Lincoln and by President Obama in both his inaugurations. Trump apparently passed up a Bible he owns that was signed by the evangelist Billy Graham. That Bible was given to Trump by his friend, Pastor Paula White, who will give an invocation today at the inauguration.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Chief Justice John Roberts is being introduced to give Trump the oath.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump and his family are standing at the podium.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Many Republicans still hold Justice Roberts responsible for not overturning the health care law.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump waved to the crowd before putting his hand on the Bible. For Trump, all of this is about the crowds.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump is now sworn in. The transfer of power is complete.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  At 12 p.m. sharp.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump’s children, particularly Don Jr. and Tiffany, look thrilled.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  And so it begins.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump and Obama are shaking hands. Trump waves to the crowd.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  For those of you reading with us, Trump has been running for president in some form or another for 30 years. It began with his 1987 publication of “The Art of the Deal,” and a draft effort out of New Hampshire. It then went into 2000 when he considered a run on the Reform Party line, which was planned more seriously than he acknowledges. Then in 2011 he weighed running, and began his birther focus.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Donald J.  Trump is now president of the United States.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Our colleague Eric Schmitt reports that a United States defense official said that a B-52 bomber and drones attacked a “core” Qaeda camp in Syria yesterday, killing more than 100 fighters.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Obama going out with a bang, literally.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump takes the microphone and thanks the former presidents, Americans and people of the world.     Morrigan McCarthy    Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Why is he thanking the people of the world?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump: “Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.”   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump thanks the Obamas for “their gracious aid” throughout the transition. Calls them “magnificent.”   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump says, “We are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.”   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Trump calls the Obamas magnificent.  He did not always hold them in such regard.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  The military guard behind him seems unusual; am I right?   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Yes, and they’ve dispersed, but was it because it was raining?   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump’s speech is populist so far. We have not seen a text of it in advance.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  “This moment is your moment; it belongs to you.” Will be headline, I suspect.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump says what party controls the government does not matter, what matters is that government is controlled by the people.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  This speech so far is written as though the whole country is with him: “this is your day.” Wonder if he’ll acknowledge the division?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump: “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump used the word “rulers” to describe citizens taking back their country.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  It makes me think of Obama’s line at the convention, in which he said that Americans don’t like to be “ruled.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump has a new Twitter account, folks.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  The latest Tweets from President Obama (@POTUS). Dad, husband, and 44th President of the United States. Tweets may be archived: http://t.co/eVVzoATsAR. Washington, D.C. — President Obama (@POTUS) | Twitter ( )   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump: “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  “American carnage” is a vivid phrase.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump, talking unity, says, “We are one nation, and their pain is our pain.”   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Neither Obama nor Bush look very happy about being told they’ve presided over “carnage” at home.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump says his oath is one of allegiance to all Americans.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  I know that the staff is claiming that Trump wrote this himself. But this speech is very much channeling Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller, his policy adviser.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  This is a campaign speech, as best as I can tell.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Agree with Maggie.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Very much like his convention speech too. Sticking to the script so far.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Remember his line from that speech, Alan? “I alone can fix it.” I wonder if he will channel that here.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  “Redistributed” may be his Bush 43 “nuclear” pronunciation problem.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Trump again hitting need for infrastructure bill but Hill Republicans have so far pushed that to the back burner.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump: “America first, America first.”   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  These negative and critical remarks about Washington reflect not only on Democrats but also on Republicans who have been in charge of Capitol Hill for two years and in the House for six.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump is reiterating “America First,” a phrase he learned from our colleague David Sanger in The Times’s interview with him.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Must be weird for Obama and Clinton to hear this speech in person.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Ponchos are out, the forecasted rain is falling.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump: “America will start winning again, winning like never before.”   Morrigan McCarthy    Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  I’m sorry, I know I’m overly historically-minded, but “America First” just can’t be liberated from Lindberghian politics and isolation that led to cataclysm.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump vows to eradicate “radical Islamic terrorism” from the face of the earth.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump: “When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  I do too. This is a pure rejection of the three presidents sitting up there. Trump’s line about uniting “the civilized world” against “radical Islamic terrorism” is a jarring contrast to those presidents, and it is also a reminder that the fundamental view of portions of this White House is that the United States is in a clash of civilizations.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  He just quoted Psalm 133.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Now Trump is calling for unity and solidarity.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Is he really not going to pay some tribute to Hillary? A big mistake, I think, to fail to do so. Looks small-minded.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Alan, this is always what Trump does, as you know. He describes the yin, then the yang. And people hear whatever they want to hear.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump says that the military, law enforcement and God are protecting the American people.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Does God know that?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump: “The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour for action.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  “Now arrives the hour of action.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  What Trump has done so far in this speech is not call for unity. Instead, he has anchored himself in the globe, by beginning by thanking the “people of the world.”   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Trump has been hearing from many of the preachers surrounding him that God chose him for this moment.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump leans into unity slightly, saying that people of all colors “bleed the same blood of patriots” and “we all salute the same great American flag.”   Morrigan McCarthy    Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump to Americans: “You will never be ignored again.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump bristled at the reports that Stephen Miller was writing his speech, so there was the claim he was writing it himself. It’s possible he wrote the words. But these are Stephen Miller’s ideas.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump ends with “We will make America great again.”   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump pumps his fist as he says “God bless America.”   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  As we reported earlier this week, it was a brief speech.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Obama says “good job” as he shakes Trump’s hand.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  No contact between Trump and Clinton as he greets the people around her.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Trump did not shake either Clintons’ hands, did he?   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  He did not.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Has there even been acknowledgment by Trump toward the Clintons?   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  None other than in the speech thanking the presidents.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Trump had three clergy deliver invocations, and now he’s got three more for benedictions and scripture readings. Six is an inauguration record. Most have two, Nixon had five.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  The rabbi, Marvin Hier, founded the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles to fight anti-Semitism and bigotry. More than 3,000 people signed a petition asking him not to participate in this inauguration because they said Mr. Trump has only encouraged bigots. Rabbi Hier stood by his decision. He is friendly with the family of Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and an Orthodox Jew. His family are big donors to the Wiesenthal Center.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Franklin Graham addresses Trump directly, saying that rain – that started right as Trump approached the podium – is a sign of God’s favor. His father, Billy Graham, prayed at the inaugurations of Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Then he passed the baton to Franklin, who prayed at George W. Bush’s first inauguration.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  I will say this about the address: most inaugurals are generic and thus forgettable. This one underscored his nationalist (and perhaps isolationist) and populist campaign themes. No doubt that he is promising to upend the political order.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Hello all. I’d like to note that there is always a rupture between the America described in political speeches and America the reality. But I’m struck how the America Trump described just now is at odds in so many ways with reality of America at large. Trump spoke of “carnage,” but unemployment is low, the market is booming. Most crime is dropping.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  The “carnage” line was the standout, Nick, I agree.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  It goes to the point that he is speaking to a specific slice of people–those in rural America and some small towns where there really is carnage: Hopelessness, job loss, social decay.   Morrigan McCarthy    Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Franklin Graham ends his prayer, “In Jesus’ name, amen.” He got in some trouble for that at George W. Bush’s first  inauguration, but it’s become less controversial.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  This is not in any way the type of inaugural speech we are used to hearing.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Do we all agree that if you were not with Trump a half-hour ago, you are almost certainly not with him now? He did not open his arms. He pumped his fist.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  The social decay in many towns - and in some cases it is found in cities, in states with large white populations - is not just about joblessness, it’s also about the opioid crisis.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  If Trump does not make progress on some of those fronts, it remains an open question how his base handles it.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  And yes, Jon, he emerged literally pumping his fist. Then did it rhetorically.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  This last benediction is from Bishop Wayne Jackson, a black prosperity gospel preacher who shocked everyone when he invited Trump to come to his church in Detroit for an “interview.” Jackson took a lot of flak from his community for that.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Most striking to me about the speech is that President Trump continues to describe a nation that is very different from the nation millions of others see.  Hard to overcome that fundamental divide.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  I wonder if Hillary Clinton is actually happy that they didn’t shake hands.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Yes, Carl, it’s very striking.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  This was an issue for Mitt Romney in 2012, when he described a doomsday version of America that was not reflected in a majority of people’s lives.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  That said, Jon, Obama’s critics would argue that beyond campaign stops, the 44th president did little to reach out to the other side.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  But Trump’s description of America under siege is really what is striking.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  One thought for the coming hours and days: St. Augustine once defined a nation as a multitude of rational beings united by the common objects of their love. Big question for us in the Age of Trump: what do we love in common? And, even more fundamentally, who’s “we”?   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Trump spoke of Washington almost as an enemy camp that he was invading and breaking up.  Which is somewhat his view of things.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Classic populist rhetoric, Maggie. “An evil overclass/5th column is sucking the country dry, and I will wipe them out.”   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Here’s my take: “O.K. my friends here with me on the dais, you’ve ruined our country, enriched yourselves while your fellow citizens suffered, your time is over. Now, I’ve worked up a presidential-sized hunger, how bout some lunch?”   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Obama is saying some goodbyes now. He just warmly greeted Bob Dole, who is in a wheelchair.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  That does it. They are departing the platform.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  Not rhetoric we usually hear in a modern inauguration address, however.   Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent  And the line about “American carnage” was really striking.   Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent  Yes, Nick, they are not on the same page on multiple elements. And the tone of his remarks also held them accountable for the state of things.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  For that matter, Trump frequently neither buys American nor employs American.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Jon, Dole also a weird emblem of the swirl of special interests around Trump. His lobbying firm takes credit for nudging Trump toward recognition of Taiwan.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Dole is a living emblem of a vanishing Washington. And of the Washington that the new president just announced had allowed “carnage” loose in the land.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Would love to be able to hear the side chatter between George W. Bush and Hillary and Bill Clinton.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  How’s that “pivot” working out?   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  News flash: You can keep waiting on that pivot.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Trump will govern as he ran. No surprise to those of us who have watched him in politics.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  So far the view on Fox News is that Trump was saying what needed to be said, per Tucker Carlson, who notes, this was not a conservative speech, it was populism.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  The speech gave new meaning to the Springsteen lyrics “We take care of our own,” which was the Obama 2012 anthem.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Seriously!   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  One big question I have is what expectations Trump supporters really have from his administration. Some reporting suggests that they don’t expect that much to change, necessarily. They aren’t going to punish him for walking back the wall, for example.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  To my mind, trade and infrastructure are the two domestic areas where we might see something new arise, some kind of policy fusionism between Trumpism and Republicanism.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Yup, though approach and what else is laid into a infrastructure bill will have a lot to do with how that’s received more broadly.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  How happy do you think the Bush 43s are to be heading back to Dallas?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Obama and Trump are leaving the Capitol together.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The Obamas are about to depart and head to Palm Springs for vacation.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Obama, smiling widely, in part probably happy to be going home. I also wonder if he has a politician’s appreciation for Trump’s speech, regardless of what he thinks of it himself.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Jon, I’ll never forget being in Midland, Tex., when W. came home there in 2009. Relief was palpable.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Obama and Biden exchange a big hug on the steps as Biden and his wife depart.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  As always, I am struck at how the presidency has aged Obama – in so many ways such a youthful president.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Wonder what Trump just muttered to Obama there.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Mrs. Obama is pretty expressionless as her husband chats amicably with Trump.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  On foreign policy–man, that’s going to be interesting. Trump’s speech discussed his foreign policy as having basically two points: 1) America is not getting our money’s worth from the current international order and 2) Islamic terrorism is the single biggest priority.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  I’m going to go with this moment as the most awkward small talk of all time.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Melania Trump looks quite uncomfortable.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  And so does Michelle Obama.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Perhaps Obama is making a final pitch on the merits of Obamacare.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  I mean, the speech described his presidency as a failure, verging on apocalyptic.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  When W. flew off there were some off-color gestures from the inaugural crowd, curious if there will be any of that now.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Jim, earlier a few folks chanted “lock her up” at Hillary Clinton.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The two families making their way toward the chopper.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump has his hand on Obama’s shoulder. They make a final embrace.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  That “lock her up” chanting was striking though perhaps it shouldn’t have been.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump gives Michelle two kisses and shakes her hands as he whispers something to her.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Obama turns and waves one last time as he steps onto the helicopter.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Michelle puts on a brave face, at least if our assumptions about what she is really thinking are at all accurate.     Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  And President Trump and the new first lady walk back.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  The Obama story will be written about, to borrow a phrase of Churchill’s, as long as the English language is spoken in any corner of the globe–and beyond.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Trump was a punch line at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner a couple of years ago. Now he’s president.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Jon, what are you expecting in terms of the media relationship going forward? Will past be prelude, and have we seen anything like it before?   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  Jim, as you well know every president feels persecuted by the press. But they’ve all tended to accept basic conventions – the press room, taking questions, etc. Now we have a president who has his own direct pipeline, if he chooses to continue to use it, to the people in an age of totally fractured media. (We’re all the media now, right? All you need is a social media account.) So I think the traditional reporting task has gotten much harder, and is likely to grow only more so.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  On Fox News: Bret Baier asks his panel if it can come up with anything good to say about Obama. Tucker Carlson says his initial election, and that was that.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Trump’s speech has this sort of generalized attack on elites, people shipping jobs away, big corporations. And yet his administration is stocked with people who have been on the long end of the winner-take-all economy. One really interesting question is whether his supporters see any conflict.   Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent  Pope Francis just released his message to President Trump, and it’s got some pointed language in it: PopeFrancis just released his message to #DonaldTrump, 45th President of the United States of America #inauguration2017 #἟B἞6#἟A἟8 — Salt + Light on Twitter ( saltandlighttv )   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  When was the last time in history we were here, pre-Civil War, maybe post-Civil War for a little bit? That is, in terms of the fractured landscape?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Classic Biden – he’s taking the train from Union Station back to Delaware. Same as it ever was.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  All aboard!   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  A final thought from me: Americans like to bounce from guardrail to guardrail in their choice of presidents. We moved from a naval engineer who loved detail to an actor, union president, and corporate spokesman who hated it (Carter to Reagan); from the embodiment of the sacrifices of the World War II generation to the epitome of appetite-driven Baby Boomers (Bush 41 to Clinton); from an unabashedly gut player to an intellectual law professor (Bush 43 to Obama); and now the intellectual law professor to a real-estate, reality-TV entertainer-in-chief with the briefest of attention spans (Obama to Trump). And we’ve always come out the other end O.K. Now we’ll test that proposition again.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Jon, I would note that Obama also used his large social media presence, and the official White House press and photo apparatus, to go around the press. Like Trump, he also used regional and local media to avoid the national press corps, sometimes in the hopes of getting a more direct line to his intended audience. His administration has also gone after whistleblowers and subpoenaed reporters aggressively, including our own James Risen.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Sometimes the atmospherics and lip service can be misleading.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  The difference is that Trump uses Twitter as a means of attack and discrediting.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  It’s very personal and very negative.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Yup, Nick, Obama set the table, now Trump can feast.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  I am not sure which is worse, in the end.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump is going to be making his way to Statuary Hall where he will have lunch with lawmakers and other special guests.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Then they will do the big parade to the White House.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Ben Carson has a look on his face like he just can’t believe this is all happening.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Stick with us for more analysis of this big day.   Jon Meacham Presidential Historian  In reply to Jim on media: Yep, this is an 1850s moment in terms of the landscape – a largely partisan press, inflaming rather than illuminating. But remember, too, that the 20th century idea of press neutrality is something of an historical anomaly. When Adolph Ochs bought The Times in 1896, he went with the “without fear or favor” in part because there were so many party-affiliated papers in New York.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Right, so easy to forget that, “fractured” media was the way it was for so long.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Correction: Marine One is for now “Executive One” now that Obama is a former president.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Jon, thanks for joining our live chat today!   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Thanks, Jon!   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Thanks, Jon, for joining us!   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The Obamas have landed in “Executive One” at Joint Base Andrews, where they will catch their next flight.   Morrigan McCarthy    Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  This seems like a good time to pivot to policy!   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Margot Sanger-Katz, welcome!   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  I wonder how much business talk – side conversations – there will be at this lunch. Any idea how that might go regarding Obamacare, Margot?   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  One thing that seemed notable to me in Trump’s speech is he barely mentioned health care at all.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  That surprised me, because he’s been talking about it as his No. 1 domestic policy priority in recent weeks.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Yeah too true. You think the Democrats will take Obama’s advice, not help Republicans replace Obamacare?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  For anyone who is getting hungry, here are some of the tasty items on the inaugural lunch menu: Maine lobster and Gulf shrimp with saffron sauce and peanut crumble, followed by grilled Seven Hills Angus beef with dark chocolate and juniper juice, accompanied by potato gratin.   Hamilton Boardman Editor  Lobster and Beef, but No Fries, on the Menu for Inaugural Lunch The tradition of an inaugural luncheon at the Capitol began in 1897, when the Senate Committee on Arrangements held one for President William McKinley. The New York Times   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  (Obamacare is also missing from the new White House website .)   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Wonder if any replacement becomes “Trumpcare” … Obama didn’t initially love the name, then came to embrace it, right?   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  It seems like the Democrats are holding together in opposition to changes for now. A big challenge for Republicans is that any big health reform plan will need quite a few Democratic votes in the Senate to get through. And the Democrats know that gives them power.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Big cheers as the Obamas walk through Joint Base Andrews. It looks like he’s going to say a few words.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  And you have to wonder how eager they are to show some turnabout-as-fairplay for Mitch McConnell.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Yes, I remember when he did it. He said, “I really do care.”   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Yeah. Memories (cue song)   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  At Joint Base Andrews, Obama is getting serenaded with chants of “Yes, we can!”   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Senator Schumer’s comments so far have been pretty strong about his intention to stay out of the Republican health care plans.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  A lot of Democrats, angry, will be holding him to that, especially in his home town, natch   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Margot, let’s assume a shift from Obamacare to one of the Republican plans – “state lines” abolished, move the sick into high risk pools, no mandate. What happens to health care for the notional forgotten man of Trump’s speech?   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  If you look at who has benefitted from Obamacare most, it really is that “forgotten man” demographic.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  And those people may really stand to lose out under the Republican plans, which will be much less generous to low-income people, and people who have health problems.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  And to that end, Margot: I remember when I covered George W. Bush in 2006 and the Republicans were trying to push a plan similar to the one they’re talking about now, and they couldn’t get it through Congress, and this was before their big losses later that year.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Of course, we don’t know all the details of the Republican plan yet. Trump has been promising something more expansive than Obamacare, with more people covered and lower costs.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Obama: “Michelle and I, we’ve really been milking this goodbye thing.”   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Quick side note: Obama is addressing staff and supporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, before he flies to Palm Springs. I don’t know if it’s typical. But the networks are carrying it.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  And we saw in Trump’s speech today that he is still comfortable maintaining some distance between his own policy preferences and those of Republicans in Congress.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Of course, Obamacare repeal and replacement, if it happens, will be a legislative matter. So I am paying a bit more attention to Congress than President Trump on what the policy will look like.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  I do think the political moment is substantially different than 2006.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Nick, I covered Bush’s return to Midland, in Midland, Tex., he gave a little speech when he landed there, on a stage in a little park, so yeah.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump is signing some orders, surrounded by family and congressional leaders, as Obama speaks.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Pre-Obamacare, there was a fair amount of agreement that there were problems with the health care system. But most Americans were basically happy with their own arrangements, so that created enormous inertia against any sort of big change.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Alan, any sense of which orders he is signing?   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Trump jokes about whether Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state nominee, is confirmed. Someone jokes, “It’s coming, Chuck, right?”   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  This is Trump’s first act as president. History.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Like it or not, these are Trump’s new business partners, gonna be some four (eight?) years.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  This is the best mood I think I’ve ever seen Trump in, up close.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  These seem to be related to his cabinet nominees.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  The congressional leadership is negotiating over which pens they will keep as mementos.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Trump, in gesture, asks Nancy Pelosi if she wants the pen he used to sign his confirmation of Elaine Chao as Transportation Dept. secretary. Pelosi directs the pen to Mitch McConnell, Ms. Chao’s husband.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Pivoting back to Margot’s earlier point for a second: Do you think there is now a similar inertia working in Obama’s favor?   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  It is easy for me to imagine them working out a replacement that would slow the transition down so much as to escape political any liability. But that doesn’t necessarily get it passed.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Nick, on Fox News, Chris Wallace noted that there is more support for provisions of Obamacare – which need other aspects in order to work – than Team Trump may appreciate.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  I think inertia is a really powerful force here. We are starting to see public opinion shifting in favor of the health law, after not moving for seven years.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Margot – I’ve been curious: So, if Trump wants to keep coverage for dependents up to 26 years old, and coverage for pre-existing conditions, is that all easily doable with something like the mandate?   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  I think we’re seeing some loss-aversion. People still don’t like the health care system, but they’re worried about losing what they have.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  The under-26 provision is quite easy to keep, and almost certainly will be preserved.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  The mandate is more challenging.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  If they keep the requirements on pre-existing conditions and keeping your kids, they’re creating more costs for insurers without more revenue, right?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Trump on Nikki Haley, his pick to be ambassador to the United Nations: “I think Nikki’s going to do a good job, a great job actually.”   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  That’s true, Nick, especially if they also eliminate or scale back the subsidies for middle-income people to buy insurance.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  If the goal is a system where anyone who wants insurance can buy it, then there needs to be some way of getting younger and healthier people to buy it.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  The mandate was one way to do that.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  There’s a joviality right now between Trump and the congressional leaders (whom he just trashed) that’s fascinating to watch.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Republicans have some different strategies, like punishing people with higher prices if they let their insurance lapse. That could also create an incentive for healthy people to buy insurance.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  With the ceremonial signings out of the way, they head to lunch.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  But they will need 60 votes in the Senate to pass a law that establishes a system like that. Right now, they are on track to just do away with the subsidies and the mandates.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  That could lead to a very broken insurance market. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the plan could cause 18 million people to lose their insurance next year alone.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Margot, what I’m fascinated by here is K Street. The drugmakers are gearing up to go to war against Trump, who wants to negotiate cheaper drugs, but as our colleagues have reported, the insurers are flat on their backs.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Insurers are in a tough spot. They want to have a seat at the table whatever comes next, so they’ve avoided coming out against a repeal.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  The insurance industry has had really mixed feelings about Obamacare. Some of the companies got lots of new customers, particularly in the Medicaid expansion. But many lost a lot of money in the Obamacare marketplaces.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  This Town: You stink. Pass the salt?   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  The kind of system that Republicans envision might be pretty good for them. Fewer customers, but much less risk.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  The lunch gives Trump an opportunity to make some gesture toward the Clintons, who are there, too.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Doctors are also really divided. Some are really worried about the ways that Obamacare has been changing their business model. You can count Tom Price, Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, among them. But others are worried about their patients losing access to care.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Yes, Price, no doubt channeling some doctors, has argued about the caregiving mandates in Obamacare–the best practices stuff meant to raise quality of care and bring down costs. It’s not clear to me whether he is speaking for many, most, or some doctors.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  There’s a real divide between doctors. Specialists, like Price, liked the old system, where they were well-paid and had a lot of autonomy.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Of course, there’s also a huge political divide among the medical specialities, too. Specialists are much more likely to be Republicans, and primary care docs tend to be Democrats. Is that cause or effect?   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  But some of the more primary care specialties have been more welcoming of the changes.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Remember, “bringing down costs” means cutting someone’s paycheck.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  After mingling with his staff and supporters, the Obamas walk down the red carpet onto their plane to depart for one last time.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  I wonder what it will feel like for them the first time they order room service in Palm Springs.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The Trumps are entering Statuary Hall now for the luncheon.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  And a handshake between Trump and Hillary Clinton.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  You could see him mouthing “Thank you” to her.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  This luncheon dates back to 1897, when the Senate Committee on Arrangements hosted a lunch for President McKinley and other guests at the Capitol. Inaugural Lunch Menu: Lobster and Beef, but No Fries The tradition of an inaugural luncheon at the Capitol began in 1897, when the Senate Committee on Arrangements held one for President William McKinley. The New York Times   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Has anyone noticed if Steve Bannon is in the luncheon?   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Bannon reminds me right now of the early days of Rove, when he reveled as the man behind the curtain, in the shadows   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  The luncheon took its current form in 1953, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower, his wife and 50 other guests of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies dined together.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  That year they ate creamed chicken, baked ham, and potato puffs in the Old Senate Chamber.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  But they will serve “J. Lohr 2013 Arroyo Vista chardonnay, Delicato Black Stallion 2012 Limited Release Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon and Korbel Natural “Special Inaugural Cuvée” California Champagne.”   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Today, we eat, tomorrow we fight.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  I’m celebrating Dryuary so this makes me super jealous.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  The president, of course, does not drink.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  I have to say, as a news person, the congressional story is going to be fascinating, from both sides.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  I am really eager to see if there is a Trump caucus, one that breaks away from Ryan.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  And Nick, yeah, Ryan has to be worried about that – there’s a recent precedent for it! McConnell’s money constituency - the Chamber of Commerce, etc. – can’t be thrilled with talk of protectionism and so on.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  I think I’m most fascinated by McConnell, while Ryan is important too.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Ryan’s an effective speaker but hardly a populist.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  On trade, Medicare, Social Security–he and the president are not on the same page.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  McConnell, meanwhile, has been such a master of politics through the Obama presidency. It will be interesting to see him in a policy-making mode now.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Interesting parting line from Obama as he spoke to his supporters before he took off: “This is just a – this is just a little pit stop. This is a – this is not a period, this is a comma in the continuing story of building America.”   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Trump has been making a lot of promises that will be hard to keep. On health care, it seems almost impossible to imagine him pulling off the kind of populist reform he’s promised–better for everyone, and cheaper.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Trump and Ryan seem to like both like the idea of tax reform. I’m betting it gets combined with infrastructure.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Back when I covered Albany, they used to call that a “big ugly.”   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  Oh, tax reform would be a crazy, interesting fight.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Goes to Jim’s earlier point about how they will likely bundle lots of policies together.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  I’m curious how McConnell handles that. Because Nick, haven’t a lot of businesses spent many millions on PACs McConnell supports that will want to block at least some of the Trump agenda. Will he feel caught between a rock and hard place, donorwise?   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  It’ll take a while to get official crowd estimates, but DC’s metro offered a ridership snapshot that suggests turnout was way down from recent inaugurations.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  Metro Ridership: As of 11am, 193k trips taken so far today. (11am 1/20/13 = 317k, 11am 1/20/09 = 513k, 11am 1/20/05 = 197k) #wmata — Metro on Twitter ( wmata )     Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Some of the trouble on the streets today is coming from anarchists, I wonder if they’ll be in the mix of tomorrow’s protests, which will be a different crowd, a mix of professionals.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  A question that has  been on my mind is just how high expectations are among Trump supporters, or how consistently they will judge him on outcomes.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Nick – expectations are a huge deal. I remember right after Obama won, his aides realized they’d promised his followers the moon, and Congress doesn’t tend to deliver the moon, in the best of times.   Margot Sanger-Katz Reporter, The Upshot  His speech would seem to set expectations awfully high.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  There’s been a discussion in conservative circles lately about how Trump represents the “attack the other team” aspect of their own world whereby a good conservative is someone who regularly outrages liberals or Democrats.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  I think it will also depend on Trump’s ability to spin outcomes so that people think things have gotten better.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Which is to say–some Trump supporters delight in Trump to the extent he angers the people they hate.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  And campaign talk is very much removed from governing. But great point, Alan   that’s where he excels.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  He’s done that in a way with highlighting companies announcing new hiring and projects in the United States. The numbers might not be huge, but it gives people the sense he is fulfilling promises.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  There was a great Gallup poll making the rounds showing that the percentage of Republicans who thought the economy was doing well shot up as soon as he was elected, by a pretty huge amount.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  Part of his appeal to some voters is simply his presence – he speaks for them, they identify with him, so they feel heard. It is a powerful thing.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  It would not surprise me to see Trump remain popular with his voters notwithstanding any tangible improvement in their lives, simply because his presidency, his voice, exists.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Yup, and his supporters are willing to suspend a lot of judgment to him. They’ll give him a lot of room.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  I do wonder, though, what happens if numbers inch up on unemployment (given how low they are now), etc.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Protests are starting to take over the screens of MSNBC and CNN.   Jim Rutenberg Media Columnist  Protesters are throwing rocks at police, but numbers seem pretty low.   Nicholas Confessore Political Reporter  On Facebook, liberal users are already circulating a countdown clock for the end of Trump’s term.   Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent  And there’s an impeachment website: http://www.impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org

The first signs of violence: Protesters broke shop windows in downtown Washington. A Bank of America branch had all its windows shattered, and a Starbucks was left with a gaping hole in its glass front door.

Police in riot helmets moved in quickly, using pepper spray to break up groups of protesters, who spread out and kept breaking windows. What exactly they were protesting was not clear – a witness said they saw a lot of black anarchist symbols, and most of protesters appeared to be young men.
