Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley was a consensus first-round pick in fantasy football drafts this summer.

He's been a bust.

After finishing as last year's No. 5 rusher, despite only getting serious action four weeks in, the 22-year-old former Georgia Bulldog ranks 19th in fantasy production, per FF Today.

That's fine for an RB2, but Gurley was drafted to be a superstar.

In Thursday night's 24-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, which marked the semifinals in most fantasy leagues, Gurley rushed 14 times for 38 yards. One Twitter user was so frustrated that he challenged Gurley to a fight:

The running back countered:

Pull up then. https://t.co/EmZBhVvZk0 — Todd Gurley II (@TG3II) December 16, 2016

The mic-drop line came from the heckler, though:
