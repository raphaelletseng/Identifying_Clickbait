Denim-garbed Canadian snowmobile daredevil is your new role model
Welcome to the gratifying world of reckless snowmobile aerobatics. A world very few of us knew existed, and even more few of us actually take part in. But something that all of us can enjoy. Denim-swathed YouTuber Larry Enticer of Canada spends a lot of his time doing insane jumps on his 1979 340 Yamaha Enticer snowmobile and he has the fearless unflinching bravado to match it. Watch him bravely "send it" into the sky, only to land preeeeetty hard. After totally biffing on his two jump attempts, he dismisses the failure with, "Snow's too soft. Another day, another beer." Simple sentiments that I think we can all agree with in these trying times.
