Ed Sheeran Drops Official Lyric Video for Irish-Tinged 'Galway Girl' on St. Patrick's Day: Watch  by   FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS  Sheeran also revealed that the song will be his next single. Ed Sheeran Â may be from England, but he paid tribute to his Irish roots in his track "Galway Girl" -- and just in time for St. Patrick's Day, he gifted fans with the song's official lyric video. The colorful visual features words amongst a broken up division sign (identical to the blue-and-black illustrationÂ one on his cover)Â with cute animations depicting lyrics, including pac-man like figures for the line "chatted some more, one more drink at the bar."Â Fittingly, theÂ chorus' opening line "She played the fiddle in an Irish band" features theÂ word "Irish"Â colored in the country's flag colors of green, white and orange.  And when it came time for that Irish fiddle to play, SheeranÂ -- whose Irish heritage hails from his dad's parentsÂ -- decided that the perfect image would be a giant green clover. The current Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200 chart-topperÂ may not have officially said "St. Patrick's Day," but this will definitely suffice. While announcing the new video on Twitter, Sheeran also revealed that the song will be his next single fromÂ following his initalÂ double-release of "Shape of You" and "Castle on the Hill."
