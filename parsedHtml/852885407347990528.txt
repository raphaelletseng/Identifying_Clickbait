17 Times Chris @PrattPrattPratt And @AnnaKFaris Were The Funniest Parents On Twitter
My baby's sleep number is he don't.    Keep singing Gloriana's new song "Can't Shake You" to my infant son just as a reminder to myself.    Train museum! For the 120th time!!!    Train museum! For the 223rd time!    I feel really lucky to have birthed the child of Star Lord-though I'm slightly annoyed that our son can't fly. Can't win 'em all, I guess.    My son just threw his fork across the room-and when Chris made him apologize Jack said"I can't!I can't see!I'm so sick!" An actor prepares!    245 pm. My son just told me I had a mustache like daddy's. #ThanksgivingThrowdown    Hahahahaahaa!!! Jack was watching some video on my phone and somehow posted about play-doh to my twitter. Oh man!!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ or is he a genius?    I got diarrhea for a second cause I thought I got hacked.    Oh thank God he didn't find my drafts folder. Little shit. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚    My genius baby just invented the new hollywood diet: sand!! Kid-tested, mother-approved (it's sooo cheap!)    So awesome my child can feed himself-now I can go back to bed    The numbers aren't in yet-but we're expecting jack's IQ to be 140+ considering the space boat he built    You know how when your child goes into your bathroom and gets quiet? And things seem okay? Then your eyeliner is gone    You know how when you're talking to a friend, catching up, and your child is playing quietly in the other room? Huh.    Potty training is going so great! I'm a natural! @prattprattpratt    Those are swim shorts. Put him in the pool and that's perfectly acceptable behavior. I'm proud of both of you. https://t.co/XU5uBaRDKh
