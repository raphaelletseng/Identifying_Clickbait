10 stunning side-by-side photos show just how destructive Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami were


March 2017 marks the six-year anniversary of Japan's TÅhoku earthquake and tsunami, which caused theÂ Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, a series of hydrogen explosions that were the worst since Chernobyl. Â

Though the nuclear disaster itself killed no one, the string of devastating events left more thanÂ 18,000 people dead, and over 100,000 people had to be evacuated from the area around theÂ FukushimaÂ Daiichi power plant.Â

Below are 10 before-and-after images, taken in 2011 and in 2016, of the areas affected by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake, the resulting tsunami, and the power plant accident. The images shown on one side were taken shortly after the earthquake and tsunami, while those on the other were taken more recently, after five years of cleanup.
