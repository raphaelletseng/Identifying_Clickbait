Mom Didn’t Sell Any Knitted Goods At A Fair, So Twitter Bought It All
Twitter showed a man some love after he tweeted about his mom struggling to sell her knitted wares at a craft fair. On Nov. 26, Martyn Hett of Manchester, England texted his mom, Figen, to see how she was doing. He tweeted out her heartbreaking response: My mum has set up her own stall at a craft fair and has messaged me to say she hasn't sold anything yet and my heart is breaking pic.twitter.com/cdzHn77pM5 The 28-year-old then mentioned his mom had a Depop page , which is similar to Etsy, where people buy and sell homemade goods. A friend of Hetts bought a glove creature from his mother’s Depop page : My heart is melting, thank you @LiamLambrini for being her first customer pic.twitter.com/m7xjNDz9Cc And a few more people followed along and bought goodies as well: Omg guys please continue to buy things, THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY. Her shop is here: https://t.co/wjSvW7sxVQ  pic.twitter.com/iQ0WL4qW3Z Then, in the very best way possible, knit hit the fan: What a beautiful end to this story 😭😭😭 I'm weeping.

Since it went viral, she’s decided to donate money from her earnings to a local charity, Beacon Counselling .” He also told Indy 100 that she’s getting requests from people who want her to make specific hearts to honor relatives who have passed . In regards to the response, Hett thinks the whole thing is hilarious.
