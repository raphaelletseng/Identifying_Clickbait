It’s no secret that the beauty industry is a booming business but according to new research, we Brits are spending an absolute fortune on our façades. Does your heart race when you spot a new shade of lipstick or the latest anti-ageing, bottom-lifting, elixir of youth? Well, you’re not alone because a study by Groupon has revealed that British women spend on average £70,294 on their appearance in their lifetime.   Kanye West is launching his own makeup line called Donda That’s £1,352 a year or £112.65 a month. The survey, which asked 1,000 British women about their buying habits, found that women shell out on everything from gym memberships and manicures to minor cosmetic procedures to help keep them looking and feeling good.
