Rick reaches out, attempting to reason with him - but The Governor starts a war when he proceeds to decapitate poor old Hershel instead.

6/10 "Look at the flowers" (season 4, episode 14) In a standout episode from the show's fourth season, Carol is forced to take drastic measures when young teenager Lizzie murders her sister Mika in the belief that she'll live on as a zombie. Realising Lizzie's depraved mind would endanger those around her, Carol puts a gun to the young girl's head and, telling her to "look at the flowers," pulls the trigger, fighting back the tears.

7/10 Carl's bullet to the eye (season 6, episode 9) Season six returned from its mid-season break in typically dramatic fashion when an iconic moment from the graphic novels came to life: Carl takes a bullet to the eye.

8/10 Beth is killed (season 5, episode 8) Upon being kidnapped, Beth (Emily Kinney) is taken to Grady Memorial Hospital managed by Atlanta Law Enforcement. Forced to reside there against her will, the group - including Rick and Daryl (Norman Reedus) - eventually find her - only for her to be accidentally shot in the head by her captor. The worst thing? Her sister Maggie (Lauren Cohan) had just arrived outside.

9/10 Negan kills Abraham Season seven opened in brutal form as we discovered it was Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) at the opposite end of Negan's baseball bat. "Suck my nuts," the soldier growls as the Saviours' leader brings Lucille raining down on his head until nothing remains but a pulpy mess.

10/10 Negan kills Glenn Negan decides to punish the group once more after getting clocked round the face by Daryl. Without expectation, he thwacks Lucille round the head of poor Glenn. With his eyeball popping out of his head, he manages: "I'll find you, Maggie before Negan proceeds to finish the job ending the former pizza delivery boy's life.

Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green)

Things are not looking good for Sasha. Last time we saw her, she was imprisoned in a cell at the Sanctuary having just been handed a suicide pill by Eugene, determined to kill herself before being used by Negan to hurt her friends. Whichever way things go down, it's tough to see poor Sasha getting out of the finale alive - especially considering Sonequa Martin-Green has been cast as the lead in new TV series Star Trek Discovery. Say your goodbyes.

Eugene (Josh McDermitt)

Eugene turned his back on his fellow Alexandrians earlier this season, so he's most certainly higher up on the list of people who deserve to perish. Not that we'd like to see it; Eugene joined forces with The Saviours out of nothing but cold hard fear of Negan. He'll no doubt be put to use in whatever horrible plan Negan has in store for Alexandria, especially if he discovers he gave Sasha the poison,. That, and he's in David Lynch's upcoming Twin Peaks revival.

Gregory (Xander Berkeley)

In Gregory, we have another coward on our hands - and one who goes out of his way to abate The Saviours so readily seems destined for the most gruesome of deaths. Currently, it seems like old Gregory is on his way to the Sanctuary to - as promised - fill Simon (Steven Ogg) in on the shenanigans the Hilltop Colony and surrounding communities are planning for The Saviours. This could completely backfire on him. He could also be used to scupper Rick's plan - this man hasbeen the Hilltop leader for some time now so will undoubtedly have people who'd be sad to see him go.

Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos)

It'd be one hell of a shocking turnaround should Rosita bite the bullet especially after being handed a lifeline by Sasha a few weeks back when the latter locked her out of their plans to assassinate Negan. Rosita is still feeling grief over Abraham's murder and is completely plagued with guilt over what happened to Olivia so she'll be gunning for The Saviours more than anyone when the ultimate showdown arises. And let's not forget, she damaged Lucille - Negan most certainly won't forget that soon.

Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride)

Following a brush with death this time last year, Carol's been relatively out of the line of fire for an entire season - rare for a character who is usually unafraid to get her hands dirty. It seems she's now on board with Ezekiel's plan to go into battle against The Saviours so she's going to thrust herself right back into it. This season opened with the death of an original cast member - perhaps things will come full circle and rid itself of another. It's tough to see Rick, Carl and Daryl going at this stage which would leave Carol. Please no.

The Walking Dead concludes its seventh season this Sunday (2 April) and the following evening in the UK (3 April) at 9pm on FOX.
