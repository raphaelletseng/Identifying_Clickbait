Scott Weinger andÂ Linda Larkin voiced Aladdin and Jasmine in the 1992 animated feature, which follows a street-wise youth who tries to woo a princess and defeat an evil sorcerer after he stumbles upon a magic lamp and isÂ granted three wishes by a genieÂ trapped inside.

Big FishÂ writer John August penned the screenplay for the feature, which is being produced by Dan Lin via his Lin Pictures banner, with Jonathan EirichÂ executive producing.

Recently, Disney had a similar casting call for the leads in the live-actionÂ MulanÂ remake, asking that those who audition speak "fluent English and Mandarin Chinese." The casting notice was posted on Twitter earlier on Thursday.
