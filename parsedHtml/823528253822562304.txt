India Rest Ashwin & Jadeja For T20Is Vs England While Mishra Comes In
India Rest Ravichandran Ashwin & Ravindra Jadeja For T20Is Vs England While Amit Mishra Comes In Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin, India's two premier spinners have been rested for the three-match T20 series against England beginning January 26. In a statement released by BCCI, legspinner Amit Mishra and Jammu and Kashmir allrounder Parvez Rasool have been named in place of them. Jadeja and Ashwin combined for seven wickets in the three ODIs with the offspinner going wicketless in two matches. Jadeja on the other hand, following a fruitful Test series, could manage only 29 with the bat. Considering the plethora of injuries sustained by the Indian players, the move is understandable on the part of the board as Ashwin and Jadeja have been playing constantly. Mishra last played an ODI during the fifth game against New Zealand where he took a five-wicket-haul to lead India to a 3-2 series win. He was also named the Man of the Series for picking up 15 wickets at an average of 14.33. Rasool on the other hand, has played only one ODI for India - against Bangladesh in 2014 - where he finished with 2/60. The three T20I's will be played in Kanpur, Nagpur and Bengaluru.
