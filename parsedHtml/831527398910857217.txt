Russia Appears To Defend Michael Flynn With Super-Weird Message On Twitter
Russia Defends Michael Flynn With Super-Weird Tweet
The Russian Embassy sent out a cryptic message on Twitter on Monday that appeared to be in defense of Michael Flynn , the national security adviser to President Donald Trump who quit that evening . Flynn has been facing accusations that he discussed lifting U.S. sanctions against Russia in a phone call with the ambassador before Trump’s inauguration. The embassy’s tweet claimed it didn’t happen ― and included an odd image: #Peskov : There have been no talks between #Russia and the #UnitedStates about the lifting of sanctions https://t.co/KWhjB3UMj1  pic.twitter.com/IUTlmXMTEL Here’s some of the reaction:  @RusEmbUSA  @mfa_russia  @KremlinRussia_E  @RusCons_TX  @consulrussiaSF  @GK_Seattle  @GovernmentRF  @minpromtorg_rus  @MinistryEconomy  pic.twitter.com/0fHiEM58V4 @RusEmbUSA Don't get me wrong: I love hamburgers and all.
