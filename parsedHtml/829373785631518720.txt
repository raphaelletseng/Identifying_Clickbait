9 up-and-coming healthy fast food chains that should scare McDonald's


Legacy mega-brands like McDonald's, KFC, and Burger King have dominated the fast food industry for decades.

But within the last few years, many American consumers have shown a growing interest in healthier fast food that incorporates more low-calorie ingredients and fresh produce while remainingÂ convenient and affordable.

In late 2016, top food executives from PepsiCo and Campbell Soup CompanyÂ told Fortune that cleaner food isÂ not just a trend, but a movement. And that shiftÂ isÂ spilling over into the fast food market too, forcingÂ legacy chains toÂ try to keep up. In the last four years, Taco Bell has pledged to cut artificial ingredients and use cage-free eggs, and has introduced a lower-calorie menu. McDonald's has Â worked with dietitians, removed antibiotics from its chicken, and added more salads to its menu.

But new healthy fast food chains are also seizing the opportunity to compete with legacy brands, creating low-calorieÂ menus for similarÂ prices. These new US chains are regional (for now), but they'reÂ growing in popularity.
