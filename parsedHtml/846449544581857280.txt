Bros at a city council meeting demand a 12-foot statue of Paul Walker and it's perfect
Dudes demand a 12-foot statue of Paul Walker at a city council meeting
These two dudes put on their best graphic tees and "bacon" beanies, watched a video called "How to Tie a Tie," and rolled up to San Clemente's City Council meeting with one prerogative: get a 12-foot statue of Paul Walker built on the San Clemente pier, stat. Why? Because it'd be inspiring, duh. Paul Walker helped countless dudes work up the courage to "ask out Shelby," and, like, "stand tall." Plus, they're "pretty sure Paul's cousin went to San Clemente high school for at least a few semesters," and "everyone is so steamed," right now, it'd be the perfect solution to calm down a world that's really, really "P.O'd." If anyone can make it happen, it's these two.
