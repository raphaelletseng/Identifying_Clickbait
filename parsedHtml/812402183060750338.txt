Things Santa Claus' beard looks like:

The stuffing inside of a teddy bear

A bunch o' cotton balls

An overflowing bubble bath

A fur stole made from a white bunny

Cotton candy without dye

And, as artist Dudolf proves, a sheep.

He drew a sea of St. Nicks, featuring one adorable sheep doing his best to blend in.Â

Can you spot the sheep?
