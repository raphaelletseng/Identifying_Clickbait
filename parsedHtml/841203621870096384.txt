Many of us have experienced that sinking feeling when we accidentally send a message to the wrong person.

But next time you make an awkward typo just think to yourself: it could be worse. Much worse.

At least it (hopefully) wasn't an explicit text intended for your boyfriend that you accidentally sent to your boss.

That's exactly what happened to a few unfortunate employees who shared their blunders on the anonymous secret-sharing website Whisper.
