Farmer kills girlfriend and has sex with her corpse to satisfy needs


Sunday Ushie who says he killed his girlfriend

A farmer killed his girlfriend and had sex with the corpse because he said the mother-of-two would not sleep with him when she was alive.

Sunday Ushie, 35, said he had been dating the Nnena Samuel, 30, for a couple of months and showered her with cash but she never let him sleep with her.

After inviting her to his flat in Nigeria, the farmer claimed he butchered her and had sex with her mutilated body.

The suspected murderer said: 'Out of anger, I killed her and took that thing she has been denying me of.

'It was strange sleeping with a corpse.

'I never had sex with her when she was alive because she never gave me that opportunity.

'I was always giving her money, but she didn't allow us to have sex.'

Ushie is being held in custody over the killing in Adijinkpor, Nigeria.

Parts of the victim's body, including her mouth, hand and leg, were mutilated and Ushie blamed the savage slaughter on Satan.

'It is the work of the devil,' the cocoa farmer told reporters after his arrest.

'I do not know how it happened. I am the one who killed her with a knife.

'She was always coming to my place and I spent a lot of money on her.

'She was my girlfriend and I knew her for two months before this incident.

'I slept with her corpse after killing her.'

Police Commissioner Hafiz Inuwa confirmed the suspect has been arrested for the killing

Police Commissioner Hafiz Inuwa said: 'The suspect has been arrested in connection to the crime and he confessed that he killed the woman before having carnal knowledge of her.

'Her right hand and left leg and mouth were severed by the suspect.

'The children of the deceased, Hezekiah, 11, and Ezekiel, nine, confirmed to the police that their mother was invited out by the suspect but did not return home.'
