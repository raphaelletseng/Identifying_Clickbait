Flesh eating bacteria: Two adults in western Sydney hospital battling rare and painful infection

Updated

Two people are being treated in a Western Sydney Hospital for a rare flesh-eating bacteria.

What is necrotising fasciitis? Necrotising fasciitis is a flesh-eating infection

It kills the body's soft tissue, and is extremely painful

It is not contagious, and normally enters the body through a break in the skin

The 57-year-old man and 46-year-old woman contracted nectrotising fasciitis and are in a stable condition in Blacktown Hospital.

The ABC understand the man's condition is life threatening and that he has had significant amounts of skin removed in several operations.

Dr Jon Iredell, director of infectious diseases at Westmead Hospital, said contracting the infection was just "bad luck".

"It can cause terrible infections and sometimes these require intensive care and surgery to control them," he said.

"You or I could contract this if we had the right bug in the wrong place at the wrong time.

"These sorts of things can get through any breach in the skin, scratching an insect bite or something like that would be one way to do it."

A combination of surgery and antibiotics are used to combat the infection.

A New South Wales Health statement said there was no risk to the public, and the community should not be alarmed.

"The infection tends to undermine the tissues a bit and so you have to often operate more than once," Dr Iredell said.

"You can often end up taking away a lot of skin and soft tissues, that's why it's such a ghastly infection and why its so scary I think."
