She ranks at No. 7 among women in the stretch; Mariah Carey leads with 55 million, followed by Celine Dion (52.6 million), 2016 Women in Music Icon award-winner Shania Twain (34.7 million), Britney Spears (33.5 million), Reba McEntire (30.5 million) and Taylor Swift (29.8 million).

Looking at Madonna's digital song sales (since Nielsen began tracking downloads in 2003), 2008's "4 Minutes," featuring Justin Timberlake and Timbaland, leads with 3.1 million sold.

Following are 1986's (7-times Platinum); (5-times Platinum); and and (each 4-times Platinum). Hi Gary, As 2016 comes to a close, lots of songs we loved this year will give way to new songs for our ears as soon as 2017 starts. So, I would love to share my favourite tracks of this year with you and readers. (I chose only one song per artist.) Let's do this! First, five honorable mentions: "Roses," by The Chainsmokers feat. Rozes "Capsize," Frenship feat. Emily Warren "Hurts So Good," Astrid S "The Greatest," Sia feat. Kendrick Lamar "Million Reasons," Lady Gaga Now, my top 10: 10, "Freak of Nature," Broods feat. Tove Lo Both of these artists released brilliant, underrated albums in 2016 and this song perfectly combines their styles and voices, starting with a smooth hum from Georgia Nott (Broods' vocalist) all the way though to when the song reaches a climax with both artists' finest vocals this year. 9, "Do You Miss Me at All," Bridgit Mendler Wow, 2016 Bridgit is a whole lot more mature than 2012 Bridgit. The production team did an amazing job with this one, as well. After repeated listens, I was captivated; definitely give it two or three listens. 8. "Work From Home," Fifth Harmony feat. Ty Dolla $ign Not only do all the group's members sing flawlessly and harmonize (ha) perfectly together, but this song also showed how successful a catchy song can be. 7, "One Dance," Drake feat. WizKid & Kyla I especially love the little echo it's got going in the background. 6, "False Alarm," The Weeknd Although I absolutely love "Starboy," I can't deny that this song is just a little bit better. From its vocalization to its chorus, it's just a true milestone of 2016.  5, "Spoon Me," Elliphant feat. Skrillex I chose it because I felt like I had the most fun with it. Just jokingly screaming the lyrics with friends while dancing to Skrillex's beats makes it one of the standout songs for this artist. (Also a shoutout to "Where Is Home," featuring Twin Shadow, which I almost equally love.) 4, "This Is What You Came For," Calvin Harris feat. Rihanna The track that got everybody to the dancefloor this year, punctuated by its No. 1 rank on 's year-end Dance Club Songs chart for 2016. 3, "Stone Cold," Demi Lovato Demi just slays. The most emotional song since Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" is delivered with the feels. And … when she hits that last note. 2, "Desperado," Rihanna Yes, I know I said no artists twice but, technically, "This" is Calvin's song. And who can blame me for putting perhaps the most omnipresent artist of 2016 here again? I get chills every time I listen, from my favourite artist of all time. 1, "Into You," Ariana Grande Her album is full of songs to last. Beginning in May, I found myself coming back to this song almost every day and I still love, love, love it. The production is on point, it's so catchy, her vocal performance is crazy and, overall, the whole tune just feels so good. I hope you enjoyed my rundown, and I'd love to know your and other readers' picks! Norman GroÃe Saxony, Germany Thanks, Norman, for getting the ball rolling on readers' year-end favorites for 2016. Great picks, by the way; I hope "False Alarm" becomes a single, while "Into You" stood out to me as the best song on the first time I heard the album (even if the title cut and "Side to Side," featuring Nicki Minaj, have become bigger hits on the Billboard Hot 100 , each hitting the top 10 as opposed to the No. 13 peak of "Into You.") And, always great to see songs like Astrid S' "Hurts So Good" shining a spotlight on what hits readers around the world like that may not have found mainstream success in the U.S. (although that track did reach No. 7 in May on the U.S.-based Billboard + Twitter Emerging Artists chart.)

READERS' FAVORITES OF 2016

Hi Gary,

As 2016 comes to a close, lots of songs we loved this year will give way to new songs for our ears as soon as 2017 starts. So, I would love to share my favourite tracks of this year with you and readers. (I chose only one song per artist.) Let's do this!

First, five honorable mentions:

"Roses," by The Chainsmokers feat. Rozes

"Capsize," Frenship feat. Emily Warren

"Hurts So Good," Astrid S

"The Greatest," Sia feat. Kendrick Lamar

"Million Reasons," Lady Gaga

Now, my top 10:

10, "Freak of Nature," Broods feat. Tove Lo

Both of these artists released brilliant, underrated albums in 2016 and this song perfectly combines their styles and voices, starting with a smooth hum from Georgia Nott (Broods' vocalist) all the way though to when the song reaches a climax with both artists' finest vocals this year.

9, "Do You Miss Me at All," Bridgit Mendler

Wow, 2016 Bridgit is a whole lot more mature than 2012 Bridgit. The production team did an amazing job with this one, as well. After repeated listens, I was captivated; definitely give it two or three listens.

8. "Work From Home," Fifth Harmony feat. Ty Dolla $ign

Not only do all the group's members sing flawlessly and harmonize (ha) perfectly together, but this song also showed how successful a catchy song can be.

7, "One Dance," Drake feat. WizKid & Kyla

I especially love the little echo it's got going in the background.

6, "False Alarm," The Weeknd

Although I absolutely love "Starboy," I can't deny that this song is just a little bit better. From its vocalization to its chorus, it's just a true milestone of 2016.

5, "Spoon Me," Elliphant feat. Skrillex

I chose it because I felt like I had the most fun with it. Just jokingly screaming the lyrics with friends while dancing to Skrillex's beats makes it one of the standout songs for this artist. (Also a shoutout to "Where Is Home," featuring Twin Shadow, which I almost equally love.)

4, "This Is What You Came For," Calvin Harris feat. Rihanna

The track that got everybody to the dancefloor this year, punctuated by its No. 1 rank on Billboard's year-end Dance Club Songs chart for 2016.

3, "Stone Cold," Demi Lovato

Demi just slays. The most emotional song since Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" is delivered with the feels. And … when she hits that last note.

2, "Desperado," Rihanna

Yes, I know I said no artists twice but, technically, "This" is Calvin's song. And who can blame me for putting perhaps the most omnipresent artist of 2016 here again? I get chills every time I listen, from my favourite artist of all time.

1, "Into You," Ariana Grande

Her album Dangerous Woman is full of songs to last. Beginning in May, I found myself coming back to this song almost every day and I still love, love, love it. The production is on point, it's so catchy, her vocal performance is crazy and, overall, the whole tune just feels so good.

I hope you enjoyed my rundown, and I'd love to know your and other Billboard readers' picks!

Norman GroÃe

Saxony, Germany

Thanks, Norman, for getting the ball rolling on readers' year-end favorites for 2016. Great picks, by the way; I hope "False Alarm" becomes a Starboy single, while "Into You" stood out to me as the best song on Dangerous Woman the first time I heard the album (even if the title cut and "Side to Side," featuring Nicki Minaj, have become bigger hits on the Billboard Hot 100, each hitting the top 10 as opposed to the No. 13 peak of "Into You.")

And, always great to see songs like Astrid S' "Hurts So Good" shining a spotlight on what hits readers around the world like that may not have found mainstream success in the U.S. (although that track did reach No. 7 in May on the U.S.-based Billboard + Twitter Emerging Artists chart.)
