Tim Kurkjian breaks down how MLB players and owners were able to reach agreement on a five-year labor contract. (2:41)

It took nearly around-the-clock bargaining over the past two days and nights, but Major League Baseball and its players' union have kept their 21-year streak of labor peace intact for another five years.

Shortly before 9 p.m. ET Wednesday, the two sides reached agreement on a five-year collective bargaining agreement that will run through the 2021 season. The deal was agreed to just over three hours before the previous CBA would have expired at 12:01 a.m. ET Thursday.

The new agreement averts a potential lockout of the players that would have frozen baseball's hot stove and pulled the plug on the major league portion of next week's winter meetings.

Editor's Picks Agent: New CBA deal 'increases the likelihood of a work stoppage in five years' A union memo underscores questions about negotiating mistakes that could not only hurt players this offseason, but could lead to future labor strife.

Could teams actually pay a 92 percent luxury tax under the new CBA? Yes â¦ and no. How much could penalties for spending big cost the teams with MLB's highest payrolls? Here's the math, using the Dodgers and Yankees as case studies.

Earth-shattering? Not quite, but new agreement generating buzz Some key points in baseball's new labor deal -- including a hard cap on international players -- already have the industry talking. 2 Related

By the time the deal was reached Wednesday, the two sides had been negotiating almost continuously for more than 24 hours -- on little or no sleep. It is believed that the final hurdle was an agreement on a new luxury-tax system, in tandem with an end to draft-pick compensation for free agents signed by all but a handful of teams.

In announcing the agreement, MLB said it will make specific terms available when drafting is complete.

"Happy it's done, and baseball is back on,'' Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy said.

Some additional points to the deal (which covers the 2017-21 seasons), according to ESPN sources and The Associated Press:

The league that wins the All-Star Game no longer will get home-field advantage in the World Series, which instead will go to the pennant winner with the better regular-season record.

Smokeless tobacco will be banned for all new big leaguers.
