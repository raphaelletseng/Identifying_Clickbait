This season, All-Star Game starters were determined by voting from fans (50 percent), current players and media (both 25 percent).

While Westbrook was first in voting among both players and media, he finished third in the fan voting. Stephen Curry, who will start alongside James Harden at guard for the West, finished first.

After being informed Westbrook didn't get the starting nod, Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers told ESPN: "Fake news. I am just shocked the fans don't see the same thing we see."
