‘Massive landscapes, deep valleys, canyons … it’s a trick of the eye’: Joseph Philipson’s photographs of lines in the sand

Photographer Joseph Philipson saw more than just cuts in the sand on the shores of Long Beach, Calif. He saw the “code that constructs our visual reality,” or the mathematical phenomenon of fractals, mathematical sets that show a repeating pattern at every scale. In nature, fractals can be seen not only on coastlines but also river systems, blood vessels and crystals, to name a few. Philipson noted to In Sight that his images could be “massive landscapes, deep valleys, canyons … it’s a trick of the eye but I’m really only maybe five feet over.” More on In Sight: Surreal photos of crashing waves caught in motion on Lake Erie What the melting of Greenland looks like Entrancing photos of oil interacting with water
