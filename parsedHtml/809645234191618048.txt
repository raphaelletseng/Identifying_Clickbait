It has also asked for documents showing all communications between the Bureau and far-right website Breitbart News, including its former executive chairman, Steve Bannon, who is now Mr Trump’s chief strategist. Vice News and Mr Shapiro have filed three previous lawsuits seeking information from US law enforcement agencies relating to the 2016 presidential election and Mr Trump’s financial dealings. The FBI's release of documents relating to President Clinton’s pardon of Mr Rich came four days after it controversially announced it was investigating new emails as part of its probe into Mrs Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as US Secretary of State. That announcement, 11 days before polling day, was met with a barrage of condemnation from former Justice Department officials, Democrat politicians and other commentators. FBI Director James Comey faced accusations he was attempting to influence the outcome of the election but said it was simply his duty to inform Congress of the new enquiries. The FBI announced the day before polls opened that it had found nothing in the new emails to warrant further investigation of Mrs Clinton. Earlier this week, election analyst Nate Silver said the FBI announcing of its new enquiries had cost Hillary Clinton the election . Mr Silver said: “Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race…Lace-deciding voters broke strongly against Clinton in swing states, enough to cost her Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.” More about: FBI Vice News James Comey Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton Donald Trump Comments
