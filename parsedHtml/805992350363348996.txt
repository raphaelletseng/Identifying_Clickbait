'Bohemian Rhapsody' As A Live-Action Film Is A Wild Crime Drama
This is the real life. No, it’s not just fantasy: An acted-out version of “Bohemian Rhapsody” exists. You undoubtedly know the iconic song by Queen — likely because you can’t go to a single karaoke night at a bar without someone screaming it out — so the video creators at Corridor Digital have turned what you already know and love about the song on its head. They’ve conducted a dramatic reading of sorts with the lyrics, converting the song from a rock opera power ballad into a melodramatic short film.
