Billie Lourd is getting by with a little help from her friends.

The “Scream Queens” actress thanked her squad over social media for their support on Tuesday about a month after the devastating loss of her mother, Carrie Fisher, and grandmother, Debbie Reynolds.

Lourd posted a photo featuring some “supremely supportive humans,” including her co-star and rumored boyfriend, Taylor Lautner, and her stepfather, Bruce Bozzi.

In peak Fisher style, however, Lourd is “finding the funny” amidst the tragedy ― everyone in the photo is wearing animal onesies.

“This group of onesie clad supremely supportive humans (and many others #notpicturedbutinthepicture) are the kings and queens of my world,” she wrote in the caption, adding “#gratefulfortheirgreatness” and “#friendsfindingthefunny.”

Lautner has repeatedly appeared by Lourd’s side in recent weeks, regularly spotted out and about with the actress after attending Fisher and Reynolds’ memorial service and funeral.
