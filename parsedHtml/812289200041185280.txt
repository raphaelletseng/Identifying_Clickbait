Tiger Woods Tweets Odd Photo of Himself as a Shirtless 'Mack Daddy Santa' for His Children
Most of the public knows Tiger Woods for mastering the game of golf‚Äîas well as some other things that we'll leave alone for now. But what many find surprising about the golf legend is that he actually has a sense of humor. Woods posted a half-naked photo of himself with a fake white beard, Santa Claus hat underneath an all-black Raiders cap, and wrap-around black shades on his Twitter account Tuesday. According to Tiger, this head-scratching photo is an annual Christmas tradition for his childrens' entertainment, because the caption in the tweet reads, "Xmas tradition that my kids love. Mac Daddy Santa is back!" Understandably, most of Tiger's social media followers didn't get the very, very inside joke. So they decided to make some jokes of their own. Here are some of the better reactions: 'Hey honey, the Mac Daddy Santa is coming to town tonight' 'The what' 'Mac Daddy Santa' 'What's wrong with you' 'Well, you see Tiger Woods p The irony of Tiger Woods calling himself Mac Daddy Santa and him getting put on blast for all his hoes a couple years ago is funny af No way @TigerWoods THIS is the real Mac Daddy Santa! pic.twitter.com/zqFUtAv1z4 Remember that day when your entire timeline became shirtless Tiger Woods Santa pictures? @TigerWoods I guarantee that your kids do not love "Mac Daddy Santa" Mac Daddy Santa is everything I thought Tiger Woods was not. https://t.co/7DDVVLNmmA A moment has been formed.  ‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúTiger Woods is...
