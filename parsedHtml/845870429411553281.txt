10 Reasons Why The World Must Do Something About South Sudan's Famine Right Now
In February, a famine was officially declared in South Sudan, only the second country to be existing with this declaration since 2000. One was declared in Somalia in 2011, where at least 2,60,000 people died and, according to the UN Food Program, half of them were children below five years of age. The fact that South Sudan has officially been pronounced as a nation suffering from a famine, means that people are dying every day. South Sudan only became independent in 2011, making it the world’s youngest state. Soon after acquiring independence, the country became entangled in a civil war for the past three years. The conflict began in 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy Riek Machar of plotting a coup against him. The war has caused massive chaos in the country from people being forced to flee, halted agriculture, which has increased food prices, and aid agencies being blocked from accessing people in dire need of support.  1. the worst famine of its kind, since 1945, is insidiously unfolding in South Sudan and it’s completely a man-made crisis. Almost half of the country’s population is at risk. 2. An estimated 100,000 people are facing starvation, with another one million on the brink of famine. According to the UN, nearly five million people are going hungry. 3. UNICEF warned that more than 2,70,000 children across the width and breadth of the country are malnourished. 20,000 of them are living in famine-affected areas. 4. A worsening economic situation and low agricultural output have caused food prices to inflate with exaggeration. This is triggered a food security crisis. 5. Almost 40 per cent of the population struggles to put three full meals on their plate. Children are by far the most vulnerable. Over 3,60,000 children under the age of five are estimated to be suffering from acute to severe malnutrition.

How did it start?

South Sudan only became independent in 2011, making it the world’s youngest state. Soon after acquiring independence, the country became entangled in a civil war for the past three years. The conflict began in 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy Riek Machar of plotting a coup against him. The war has caused massive chaos in the country from people being forced to flee, halted agriculture, which has increased food prices, and aid agencies being blocked from accessing people in dire need of support.

In 10 points, we tell you why a large-scale collective response on an international plane has become necessary:

1. According to the United Nations, the worst famine of its kind, since 1945, is insidiously unfolding in South Sudan and it’s completely a man-made crisis. Almost half of the country’s population is at risk.

2. An estimated 100,000 people are facing starvation, with another one million on the brink of famine. According to the UN, nearly five million people are going hungry.
