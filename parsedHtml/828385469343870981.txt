Hungry Howie's , a pizzeria with over 550 locations in 21 states, predicts that they'll sell 200,600 pizzas on Super Bowl Sunday – 33,600 more than they would on a typical Sunday. And for those who like numbers, that translates into 61,800 pounds of cheese, 7,632 gallons of sauce and 93 tons of dough.

Buffalo Wings & Rings not surprisingly reports a huge jump as well. The restaurant chain nationwide typically has over 9,000 orders of traditional wings and close to 8,000 boneless wings on Super Bowl Sunday – compared to around 3,700 traditional wings and 5,200 boneless wings on an average day. To underscore my point that the Super Bowl truly is like Christmas for some business owners, Professor Thom's is a Patriots bar in New York City, and the owner, Pete Levin, estimates that the Super Bowl weekend accounts for almost 75 percent of the bar's food sales for the year. He says that customers will eat more than 150 pounds of cheese over Super Bowl weekend.
