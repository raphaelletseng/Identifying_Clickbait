Chief of Dentsu, Japanese Ad Agency, to Resign Over Employee’s Suicide
Chief of Dentsu, Japanese Ad Agency, to Resign Over Employee’s Suicide
TOKYO — In the months before she jumped to her death from a company dormitory last Christmas, a young employee at a Japanese advertising agency told friends on Twitter of enduring harassment and grueling long hours on the job. “They’re making me work Saturdays and Sundays again,” the employee, Matsuri Takahashi, 24, wrote in one post. “I seriously want to end it all.” “It’s 4 a.m. My body’s trembling,” she said in another. “I’m going to die. I’m so tired.” On Wednesday, the president and chief executive of Ms. Takahashi’s agency, Dentsu, one of the world’s largest advertising firms, said he would resign to take responsibility for her death, as well as the larger problem of dangerously long work hours at the agency that has been laid bare in its wake. Before her suicide, Ms. Takahashi was putting in more than 100 hours of overtime a month, according to an investigation by labor authorities, much of it unreported and unpaid. Japan has struggled for decades to tame the issue of excessive working hours and its consequences, including karoshi, the Japanese word for death from overwork, which gained currency in the 1980s.

It has also damaged Dentsu’s reputation and brought scrutiny from labor authorities and prosecutors. “We are taking this seriously,” the Dentsu president, Tadashi Ishii, said at a news conference. “I offer my heartfelt apology.” He said he would tender his resignation to Dentsu’s board next month but would remain in his post until March to give the company time to choose a replacement. Working late has long been seen in Japan as a badge of corporate loyalty, repaid by employers in the form of ironclad job security.
