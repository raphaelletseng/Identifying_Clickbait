Another local government official, Aizaz Ahmad, confirmed the details.

The village is close to the Swat Valley, where the army sent 30,000 troops in 2009 to battle Taliban fighters led locally by cleric Maulana Fazlullah.

He had taken control of the valley and waged a campaign of violence, including beheadings and attacks on girls' schools.

Pakistani officials say that Fazlullah fled to neighbouring Afghanistan during the offensive.

In 2013 Fazlullah became chief of the wider Pakistan Taliban group.
