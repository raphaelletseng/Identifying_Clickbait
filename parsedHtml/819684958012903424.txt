Sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor has taken the art gallery into a whole new realm: The ocean floor. The sites are more accessible than you might think, with the latest installation inaugurated this week off Lanzarote, Spain, in waters 14 meters (46 feet) deep and another off Cancun, Mexico, just 4 to 8 meters below the surface. His subsea "museums" or "sculpture parks" are designed to raise awareness of the delicate marine environment and encourage conservation. His first work in 2006, off Grenada in the West Indies, is listed as one of the Top 25 Wonders of the World by National Geographic.
