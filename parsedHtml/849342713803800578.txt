We have a few theories about this mystery.

Theory one: Someone maniacally took a scissor to a pair of jeans, leaving only the ankle cuffs and a bit of fabric connecting them to the body of the piece.

Theory three: What if these aren't pants at all, but instead, a belt. If you look, the pattern within the belt loops (very belt-like, perhaps a clue) continues down the side material. Maybe they're like the Rihanna x Manolo Blahnik 9 - 5 boots seen here on JLo.
