Parrot who trained with Scarponi mourns cyclist at tribute site


Michele Scarponi's unusual training companion, a parrot, has clearly been missing the Italian cyclist after he died in a training crash this weekend.

The female blue and yellow macaw, called Frankie, who has been pictured on training rides with Scarponi, was seen sitting alone on a sign where tributes were being laid for the Italian road racer following his death.

The cyclist died at the age of 37 after being involved in a collision with a van during a training ride.

Scarponi won the 2011 Giro d'Italia title after Alberto Contador was stripped of the crown and he also claimed victory in the opening stage of the Tour of the Alps on Monday.

An Astana team statement, who called him a 'special guy' and 'great champion', said the terrible incident took place near to Scarponi's home in Filottrano.

A statement from Team Astana read: 'This is a tragedy too big to be written.

'We left a great champion and a special guy, always smiling in every situation, he was a real milestone and a landmark for everyone in the Astana Pro Team.

Scarponi posted a video in January last year of Frankie riding with him on a training ride

Scarponi clearly had a special bond with the parrot as seen from a video the Italian racer posted on his Twitter page in January last year.

In the social media video, Scarponi was riding his bike with Frankie on his back and at the end, she pecks playfully at his helmet, promoting the rider to tell her to 'stop it.'

Frankie is something of a local celebrity in Filottrano and two years ago hit the headlines after she went missing for several days.
