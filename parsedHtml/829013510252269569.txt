The leader of Britain's biggest union and the Labour party’s biggest backer has given Jeremy Corbyn 15 months to save his job.

Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, said Mr Corbyn had until June next year - when the local elections in London and other cities are held - to show that that win power again for the Labour party.

Previously Mr McCluskey has said that Mr Corbyn had until 2019 to show he has what it takes to become Prime Minister.

Asked on BBC Radio Five Live’s Pienaar’s Politics if Mr Corbyn was “the guy to take Labour back into office at the next general election with an overall majority”, Mr McLuskey did not answer directly.

But he said: “The reality is that I'm hoping that he's given an opportunity to put the alternative that Labour are building to the British electorate.

“And hopefully we'll see if he can break through and the opinion polls begin to change. I would suggest that the next 15 months or so will give us the answer to that.”
