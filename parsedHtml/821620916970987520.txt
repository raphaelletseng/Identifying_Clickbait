Please enjoy Russell Crowe's perfectly zen smartphone photography
Celebrity Twitter is usually a parade of promotional tweets and ab shots, but not so for our dear, beloved Russell Crowe. Russ may be a Hollywood star, but you guys, he's got poetry in his heart. Put simply, Crowe seems to be an avid phone photographer and it's amazing. He was the front man of late, lamented band, 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, don't forget. He's always been the people's artist and we should put him in the MOMA.
