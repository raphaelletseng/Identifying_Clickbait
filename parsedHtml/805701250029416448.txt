Markets Weather Italy Referendum Result, but Banks Are Vulnerable
£ %  € %  € % Financial markets were stoic on Monday after Italian voters decisively rejected changes to their country’s Constitution intended to speed government decision-making and spur Italy’s stagnant economy. Stocks in Europe and the United States rose, and the euro recovered from early losses — a reaction that was muted in part because opinion polls had predicted the “no” vote, giving investors time to adjust their portfolios, and also because political instability in Rome is not exactly unusual. But analysts said the potential for market turmoil remained if the vote resulted in a long period of government paralysis and delayed plans to fix Italy’s ailing banks, whose shares fell sharply on Monday. “It will be very much related to two factors,” said Nicola Nobile, a senior European economist at Oxford Economics in Milan. “What is going to happen to the banking system, and if we’re going to have a government soon.” The vote was another sign of popular resistance across Europe to changes that economists say are needed for the 19-country eurozone to overcome problems that have threatened its existence.
