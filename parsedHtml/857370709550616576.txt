The meme came full circle today when Biden signed a poster of his younger self after giving a speech in Virginia on Wednesday.

George Mason University students Ravin Hassan and Milena Michael told BuzzFeed News that the former VP was amused when they asked him to sign the poster, which has been hanging in their kitchen since January.

"He laughed so hard," Michael said. "He told us that this [was taken] the weekend that he met his wife."
