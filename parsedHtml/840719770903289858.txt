You can stream it here . SWIPE TO SEE the #QueensGotTheCrown Playlist! Go to Tidal. I just put this amazing playlist together & I really want u guys to listen! S/O to all the Queens artists from every decade reppin! Queens Get Da Money!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 A post shared by Nicki ( ) on Mar 11, 2017 at 3: PST Minaj If you really want to look for some hidden meaning behind the selections, the track titles might also tell you what's on her mind. The likes of, "Mama Said Knock You Out", "Champion" and "Between Me & You" are certainly notable tracks, but if you view them through the vision of someone continuing to take jabs at an opponent, they start to look like a direct message to Remy. There's no word yet on whether this is the thing Minaj will be dropping on Tidal, but you should probably expect her to continue throwing shade this weekend and beyond.

Nicki went immediately to Twitter and Instagram to express how proud she was of the playlist:

With appearances from Nas, Mobb Deep, 50 Cent, Ja Rule and a host of others, Minaj seems to sending a not-so-veiled message at Bronx native Remy Ma: I won, and my borough is far superior to yours. If you really want to look for some hidden meaning behind the selections, the track titles might also tell you what's on her mind. The likes of, "Mama Said Knock You Out", "Champion" and "Between Me & You" are certainly notable tracks, but if you view them through the vision of someone continuing to take jabs at an opponent, they start to look like a direct message to Remy.

There's no word yet on whether this is the only thing Minaj will be dropping on Tidal, but you should probably expect her to continue throwing shade this weekend and beyond.
