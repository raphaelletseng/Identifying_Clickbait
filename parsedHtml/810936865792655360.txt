There were blushes all round when a geyser erupted in front of shocked tourists in Iceland.

Rory Fryett-Tigges, 32, and his girlfriend Lisa French, 27, could not believe their eyes when they saw the phallic-shaped geyser near Reykjavik.

The natural phenomenon, which is formed by water and steam erupting from a spring, put on a memorable display for onlookers.

Would you believe it? Lisa French said her friends and family burst into hysterics when they saw the picture she had taken in Iceland

Lisa, a clinic manager from Littlehampton, West Sussex, said: 'We went on a day trip to the waterfalls and geysers, which erupt every six to ten minutes reaching 15-30 metres high.'

She said she captured the image by 'pure fluke'.

'My boyfriend walked up to see another geyser when I heard this one erupt so I quickly took a picture. The steam falls down so quickly so to capture it in this funny way did make us all giggle,' said Lisa.

She said: 'When we first saw the picture we was amazed at the shape it had formed, we sent it to a few friends and showed my parents who were also on the trip with us. Everyone was in tears with laughter.'

'People say size doesn't matter but that was a very impressive geyser,' joked Lisa.
