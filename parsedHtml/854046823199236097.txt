Virat Kohli Takes Stunning Catch Against Rising Pune Supergiant To Prove He's Fit As A Fiddle! Virat Kohli's return to the Indian Premier League after injury was marked by a swashbuckling fifty against Mumbai Indians. But then there's one moment that proved he's 100 per cent fit to play -- a stunning, low catch against Rising Pune Supergiant. It happened in the ninth over of the RPS innings when Rahul Tripathi played a cracking cover drive only to get caught in the covers by Virat Kohli. The bowler was Pawan Negi. Keeping in mind the high standards Kohli has always set, it isn't surprising to see him pull off such a blinder. Most importantly, he's back and it is great to see that!
