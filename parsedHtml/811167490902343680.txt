A man who shot three people at a Zurich mosque is dead, police said, confirming that a body found near the scene was that of the assailant.

Key points: Police say they have identified the dead man found near the crime scene as the suspected shooter

Two of the three victims were seriously injured in the attack

Centre is registered as association enabling Muslims to practice their religion

Zurich cantonal police said authorities had identified the suspect, but gave no details.

The gunman had stormed into the Islamic centre and opened fire on worshippers.

"The dead man found around 300 metres from the scene of the crime after the shooting in the mosque is the suspect," a statement on a police website said.

Two of the three victims — aged 30, 35 and 56 — were seriously injured in the attack, which took place near the main train station in Switzerland's financial capital.

A third sustained less severe injuries.

Police had identified the suspect only as a man around 30 years old wearing dark clothing and a dark woollen cap, who fled the mosque after the attack.

The centre is registered as an association enabling Muslims to practice their religion, particularly through instruction on Islamic beliefs and teachings, as well as providing for the preservation of Islamic cultural values and scientific seminars, according to Swiss business data website Moneyhouse.

Across Switzerland, two thirds of its 8.3 million residents identify as Christian, but in recent years the country's Muslim population has risen to 5 per cent.

In 2009, a nationwide vote backed a constitutional ban on new minarets.

The Federation of Islamic Organisations in Switzerland said the centre was not a member and it did not have any direct knowledge of the incident.
