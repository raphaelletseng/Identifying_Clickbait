Lady Gaga And Metallica's Grammy Performance Had Tough Technical Difficulties
Lady Gaga & Metallica's Grammy Act Had Some Technical Difficulties
The 59th annual Grammy Awards could be remembered for the numerous technical glitches and mistakes during the broadcast. Shortly after Adele had to stop and restart her performance during a tribute to the late George Michael, Lady Gaga and Metallicaâ€™s collaboration started with multiple problems. First, the award show only announced Lady Gagaâ€™s name when introducing the act. Then, the metal bandâ€™s frontman, James Hetfeld, didnâ€™t have a working mic. The rocky start frustrated Hetfeld enough to cause him to kick gear around until he decided to join Gaga on her working equipment. GaGa apparently got a full-back tattoo as a tribute to the band before the show, but itâ€™s pretty unclear whether itâ€™s even real .
