The next month, the company steps up Stories with its first Our Story at the Electric Daisy Carnival music festival. Snapchat says the feature is just an experiment, but it sticks. With Our Stories now allowing multiple users to participate in a single Story, Snapchat decides to make Snaps even more personalized with illustrated geofilters that can be added to photos and videos when you are in specific locations. The first set are tied to specific neighborhoods and landmarks in Los Angeles and New York.

In October, Snapchat reaches another long-awaited milestone: its first ad. It was a 20-second trailer for the movie . It pretty much freaks everyone out . The next month, the company introduces Snapcash , so users can exchange cash (via a partnership with Square) directly in their chats. The app ends the years with 71 million daily active users. 2015: Discover, tap to view and lenses Snapchat kicks off the year with its biggest update yet, a new section of the app called Discover that hosts content from a variety of publisher partners. The same update also adds scannable QR codes, called Snapcodes. Then, in July, Snapchat shocks its users by changing one of the most recognizable parts of its app. Instead of holding down to open a message, all you have to do is tap once . In September, Snapchat takes selfies to the next level with animated lenses that allow you to enhance your selfies with special effects. Rainbow barf is an instant hit. The same update also adds an in-app trophy case, new friend emoji and the ability to buy extra replays. A few months later, Snapchat follows this up with another in-app purchasing feature, its Lens Store, which allows you to pay for lenses that have already appeared within the app. Buoyed in part by the popularity of Lenses, Snapchat ends the year with more than 100 million daily active users. 2016: Video calls and Memories In March, Snapchat upgrades its chat features with a major messaging update . The update adds voice and video calling, as well as stickers, to the app's chat section. In April, stickers get an upgrade with motion-tracking emoji that allow you to pin emoji to specific parts of a video. Snapchat's Discover section gets a new look in June with a redesign that allows publishers (including ) to add cover stories to tease the content inside. Users can now also subscribe to the publishers they want to follow, in order to see those channels at the top of the app. In July, in what is its biggest departure from its disappearing messaging roots, Snapchat adds a new feature called Memories , which adds a dedicated section where Snapchat users can save and share photos from their Camera Rolls. The update is the first time the app allows users to widely share photos not taken within the app. Soon after, Snapchat formally integrates Bitmoji into its app. The update allows users to link their Bitmoji accounts to Snapchat and decorate their Snaps with custom characters. In November, lenses get an upgrade with World Lenses , which use the rear-facing camera to add effects to your Snaps. More barfing rainbows come to Snapchat. A month later, the app finally adds a group messaging feature. The app counts more than 158 million daily active users by the end of the year.
