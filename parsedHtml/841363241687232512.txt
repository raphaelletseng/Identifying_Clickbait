Passengers left without food and loo roll on British Airways flights
Passengers left without food and loo roll on British Airways flights
ritish Airways passengers claim they were left without food and loo roll last week as the airline continued to experience issues with stocking its planes properly before flights. A reader, Tessa Evans Hurrell, said she booked a holiday (flight and hotel) to Fuerteventura at half-term with BA, but found the outbound flight delayed by two hours. “Once on board,” she said, “it took three hours for the stewardesses (only two of them) to reach us with the refreshments trolley (this was also the first time we had even been offered a drink), only to be told they had run out of food halfway through the plane. They just had a couple of packets of biscuits and nuts. Terrible flight with #britishairways Fuerteventura to LGW yesterday 5pm. Ran out of food altogether by row 19. What's going on? “So we went without food throughout the two-hour delay and four-hour flight,” she said, “six hours that covered both lunch and dinner time. “It's bad enough for us adults who were hungry, tired and miserable, but our 11-year-old daughter was in tears because she was so hungry. And there were plenty of other children younger than her.” “How do you put hundreds of people in the air and then deliberately deny them food and drink for four hours-plus?” Gill Charlton, a Telegraph Travel writer, was told that there were just three sandwiches left for 110 passengers on board a flight back from Innsbruck on Friday afternoon. @British_Airways rude staff at Geneva, unclear ski carriage policy, ran out of food almost instantly on an evening flight etc etc @British_Airways It was yesterday. Ltd food,no kids food other than a yogurt pudding. Unacceptable “It is an absolute disgrace,” she said. “There was no cafe open in the terminal for some reason and on the flight I was in the first row of economy. There were two ciabatta sandwiches and one bacon roll available to buy. A few rows back they ran out of crisps.” She also claimed that BA staff were slow in getting the food out as “they were far more concerned with serving business class”. “It's one thing to have to pay (with only cards being taken too) but another thing when they can't load enough food,” she complained. "How can the airline get paid-for catering so wrong? They should be overstocking on flights - at least until they know the likely take-up. “The staff said that they'd sold more than they thought on the flight out and that they too had complained but that we should all write in so that something was done.” Another Telegraph Travel writer claimed passengers on a BA flight to Costa Rica on March 5 were delayed because the plane hadn’t been cleaned, the toilets hadn’t been emptied and the water tanks had not been filled. Staff on that flight reportedly handed out tissues when toilet roll ran out. On that same day, BA passengers on a flight to Barbados were delayed for five hours due to a shortage of loo roll . Other customers have taken to social media channels to complain about a lack of food available on flights to destinations including Geneva. When we asked British Airways about the issues faced by customers, the airline said its new M&S food has been well received. "Customers are telling us that they really appreciate the choice and quality of the M&S range available," a BA spokesman said, "and they have already bought hundreds of thousands of items, including 39,000 bacon rolls and 14,000 bottles of prosecco since they were introduced in January. 2 more @British_Airways triumphs of downgraded service. Run out of food. Seat change on boarding 12 rows back #disappointing  #poorservice "We regularly adjust stock levels on flights and have introduced contactless payment to help colleagues make faster transactions," she added. The airline apologised for the lack of toilet rolls however. "We are sorry customers were delayed after some of the many items needed for the flight weren't loaded onto the aircraft. We got them away on their holidays as soon as we could." No food, no drinks, no water in the loo & no water to wash hands in @British_Airways . Wondering I shud fly @easyJet or @Ryanair nxt time 🤔🤔 The national carrier decided to scrap the complimentary food and drink it used to serve on short-haul economy flights in January, opting instead to serve food from M&S that costs customers extra.
