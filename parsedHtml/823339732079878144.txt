Last week, some reports indicated that the findings would reveal problems with irregularly shaped batteries as the cause of the malfunctions and now Samsung's mobile chief DJ Koh has shed light on the specific cause of the malfunctions. According to Samsung, problems were found in two different manufacturing situations, both involving different series of batteries.
