The internet bands together to help Chrissy Teigen get Fun Dip off her hands
Chrissy Teigen is going to the Grammys on Sunday. Exciting! Unfortunately, her fingers are stained green with Fun Dip, and she needs it to come off before the show. Luckily, the internet is here to help. And do weird jokes. SEE ALSO: Chrissy Teigen had a very Chrissy Teigen response to her Super Bowl nip slip This is why the internet was invented, right? I ate fun dip with my fingers last night and I'm stained and Grammys are tomorrow.
