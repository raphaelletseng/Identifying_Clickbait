Tom Brady won this Super Bowl for his mother, who has cancer

Tom Brady was uncharacteristically emotional during the week preceding Super Bowl LI and now we understand why. His mother, Galynn, has been having radiation and chemotherapy to treat an undisclosed type cancer for the last 18 months and had been unable to attend any of the New England Patriots’ games during the 2016 season, a real anomaly for her. She managed to get to Super Bowl LI, though, and Brady dedicated the game to her. “She’s the one I want to win it for,” Brady told Westwood One’s Jim Gray before kickoff Sunday.   At his Super Bowl MVP press conference Monday morning, Brady said his father had been there with her “every step of the way” and that his parents set a “great example” for him. “She’s been though a lot. Way harder than what I went through last night, what the team went through,” Brady said. “All families go through challenging times personally. I’m just happy to be able to celebrate.” Later Monday morning, Brady went on Boston radio station WEEI to follow up. “The prognosis is good and she’s not quite through it but hopefully there was some healing energy from last night,” he said. After the game, Brady’s father described the relationship his son has with his mother and how special that it was for her to get to the game. “It was just awesome,” Tom Brady Sr. told MMQB’s Albert Breer . “He puts everything he can into every single game. But this one, I heard he just said, ‘I’m winning this one for my mom.’ That one jerks the tear ducts big-time. … She lives and dies with every one of her children, whether it’s in a football game or anything else. And she was very thankful. Very thankful, yeah, just very thankful that this played out.” As for the quarterback himself, he initially let social media do the talking, writing on Instagram: “It takes a team.

Tom Brady was uncharacteristically emotional during the week preceding Super Bowl LI and now we understand why.

His mother, Galynn, has been having radiation and chemotherapy to treat an undisclosed type cancer for the last 18 months and had been unable to attend any of the New England Patriots’ games during the 2016 season, a real anomaly for her. She managed to get to Super Bowl LI, though, and Brady dedicated the game to her.

“She’s the one I want to win it for,” Brady told Westwood One’s Jim Gray before kickoff Sunday.
