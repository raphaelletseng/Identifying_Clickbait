Amy Schumer Responds To Critics Who Say She Shouldn't Play Barbie
To Amy Schumer , backlash over news that she might just take the lead in an upcoming live-action “Barbie” movie shows just how right she is for the role. The Grammy-nominated comedian wrote an Instagram post Tuesday explaining why she’s glad to have the chance to play an “important and evolving icon.” After hearing Twitter commenters doubt her fitness for the part of a blonde doll, primarily due to her body type, Schumer shared a lengthy message that was in part aimed at her detractors. “I want to thank them for making it so evident that I am a great choice,” the comic wrote. “It’s that kind of response that let’s you know something’s wrong with our culture and we all need to work together to change it.” Schumer has been vocal in the past about her (perfectly healthy and normal) body. In her note, she asked, “Is it fat shaming if you know you’re not fat and have zero shame in your game? I don’t think so.” A photo posted by @amyschumer on Read her full note below: Very very honored to be nominated for 2 Grammys and to be considered to play an important and evolving icon. Is it fat shaming if you know you’re not fat and have zero shame in your game? I don’t think so. I am strong and proud of how I live my life and say what I mean and fight for what I believe in and I have a blast doing it with the people I love. Where’s the shame? It’s not there. It’s an illusion. When I look in the mirror I know who I am. Im a great friend, sister, daughter and girlfriend. I’m a badass comic headlining arenas all over the world and making tv and movies and writing books where I lay it all out there and I’m fearless like you can be. Thanks to everyone for the kind words and support and again my deepest sympathy goes out to the trolls who are in more pain than we will ever understand. I want to thank them for making it so evident that I am a great choice. It’s that kind of response that let’s you know something’s wrong with our culture and we all need to work together to change it. Anyone who has ever been bullied or felt bad about yourself I am out there fighting for you, for us. And I want you to fight for yourself too! We need to laugh at the haters and sympathize with them. They can scream as loud as they want. We can’t hear them because we are getting shit done. I am proud to lead by example. “I say if I’m beautiful, I say if I’m strong. You will not determine my story. I will.” While Sony has a “Barbie” script, The Hollywood Reporter states that Schumer will likely rewrite it with her sister and “Trainwreck” screenwriting partner, Kim Caramele. The movie will reportedly follow Barbie’s adventure through the real world after being expelled from Barbieland, à la “Enchanted,” but with more of a comment on gender and femininity in the present day. A release date has yet to be set. ALSO ON HUFFPOST: Amy Schumer's Style Evolution       Share this slide:       MORE:
