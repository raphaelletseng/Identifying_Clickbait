‘Legion’ and the Rise of Surreality TV
‘Legion’ and the Rise of Surreality TV
In the pilot of FX’s “ Legion ,” we meet David (Dan Stevens), a powerful telekinetic (so we’re told) suffering from mental illness (so he’s been told) who is rescued from a psychiatric hospital (so it appears). Unsure whether to trust his perceptions, he asks his savior and new girlfriend, Syd (Rachel Keller): “I have to know, is this real?” If you’ve kept up with this hallucinatory Marvel Comics drama, whose first season finale airs on Wednesday, you know the answer: Yes. No. Maybe! And, anyway (inhales deeply from frog-shaped vaporizer ), what is “real”? “Legion” has left viewers as full of existential doubt as David, and with good reason. Many of David’s thoughts and memories — his best friend, Lenny (Aubrey Plaza), even his childhood dog — have turned out to be figments generated by the Shadow King , a mental parasite living rent-free in David’s noggin. Scenes take place within illusions, or illusions nested within illusions. David visits the scientist Oliver Bird (Jemaine Clement) in the astral plane, where Oliver lives in a space-age bachelor pad inside an ice cube, which he generated by thought. “What’s real in this space,” Oliver says, “is whatever you want it to be.” Advertisement “Legion” is merely the latest example of recent series, from “ Westworld ” to “ Mr. Robot ,” whose stories rely on apparitions and shaky perceptions — surreality TV, an art form for the days of fake news, gaslighting and contested objectivity. Advertisement TV history is full of fantasy sequences and realities that turned out to be fake. A season of “Dallas” proved to be a dream (as did the entire run of “Newhart” ). “St. Elsewhere,” its finale suggested , was the imagining of an autistic boy. “ Lost ” spent half its final season in an alternative “sideways” universe. These past switcheroos have generally involved finale twists or narrative do-overs. The current breed owes more to the head games of “The Matrix” and “ Inception ,” which suggest that everything we see might be Plato’s-cave shadow-puppetry. “Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?” a human interrogator asks Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), a sentient robot, at the beginning of HBO’s “Westworld.” She should question, we know, because while the show’s robot “hosts” can think, their perceptions are limited by their programming.

Their memories are erasable, but the ones they retain are as vivid as physical events, to them and to the audience.

TV history is full of fantasy sequences and realities that turned out to be fake. A season of “Dallas” proved to be a dream (as did the entire run of “Newhart”). “St. Elsewhere,” its finale suggested, was the imagining of an autistic boy. “Lost” spent half its final season in an alternative “sideways” universe.

These past switcheroos have generally involved finale twists or narrative do-overs. The current breed owes more to the head games of “The Matrix” and “Inception,” which suggest that everything we see might be Plato’s-cave shadow-puppetry.
