In the aftermath of the lawsuit filed last week against Navient, the largest student loan servicer in the country, many student loan borrowers have shared their student loan repayment experiences with Forbes.

As a follow up to "What The Navient Lawsuit Means For Your Student Loans" and "What The Navient Lawsuit Means For Your Student Loans: Part 2," here are 9 questions from student loan borrowers - as well as answers - that can help guide your path forward:

Teacher Student Loan Forgiveness is for full-time teachers with five years of teaching experience in a designated elementary or secondary school or educational service agency that serves students from low income families.

2. If I have a student loan from Sallie Mae, is it considered a government loan?

In 1972, Sallie Mae, or the Student Loan Marketing Association, was established as a government-sponsored enterprise, or GSE. Sallie Mae was then privatized in 2004 when Congress terminated Sallie Mae's federal charter.
