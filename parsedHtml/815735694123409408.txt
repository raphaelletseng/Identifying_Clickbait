ASX: Australian shares gain 7pc over 2016 on resources rebound

Updated

The Australian share market posted a capital gain of 7 per cent in 2016, its best performance in three years.

Both major stock indices - the ASX 200 and broader All Ordinaries - posted a 7 per cent rise last year.

End of year analysis by broking firm CommSec showed Australia scraped into the top half of markets globally, coming 31st amongst 73 bourses studied.

The average global share rise was 10 per cent, with the MSCI index of major world markets a little below that, meaning domestic investors broadly tracked international gains.

The US share market posted a strong annual gain, largely thanks to a large Trump rally after investors rapidly cast aside early fears of the President-elect.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 large blue chip companies rose 13.4 per cent, with the broader S&P 500 index trailing with a 9.5 per cent gain.

European markets also generally rallied last year, with the FTSE in London jumping 14.4 per cent after it shrugged off initial Brexit fears and benefited from a lower pound, while Germany had a more muted 6.9 per cent gain.

However, shares in Australia's key Asian trading partners did not perform so well, with Japan's stock market up 0.4 per cent and China's down 12.3 per cent.

Including dividend payments, CommSec said the total return to holders of Australian shares was 11.6 per cent, easily beating a 3.8 per cent gain in 2015.

However, the price-to-earnings ratio crept higher in 2016, and is above its long-term average, indicating that the ASX may be a little overvalued relative to company earnings.

Battered resources firms post biggest gains in 2016

The biggest capital gains on the Australian share market were made by resources firms that had struggled badly in 2015.

Amongst the top 200 companies, Resolute Mining was the star performer with a 420 per cent surge, while the other top five gainers were also resources firms.

These companies were assisted by an unexpected leap in most commodity prices over 2016, despite a stronger US dollar (in which most of the commodities are priced).

Oil was up 45 per cent over the year and doubled in price from its multi-year lows of 2016 well below $US30 a barrel, iron ore prices surged 86 per cent, coking coal futures were up 156 per cent and thermal coal for power stations had an 87 per cent gain.

However, many analysts are dubious that the strong price gains of 2016 can be maintained in 2017.

On the other side of the ledger, some previous market darlings such as cancer treatment supplier Sirtex, Estia Health, vitamin firm Blackmores and infant formula seller Bellamy's were among the worst performers, losing more than half their value, generally from an elevated base.

The individual performances translated to the sector averages, with capital goods and materials (mining) both up more than 39 per cent, while telecoms lost 12 per cent and pharmaceuticals and biotech lost 7.5 per cent.

Movements in the Australian dollar neither helped or hindered export-exposed companies, with the currency trading in a relatively moderate 10-cent range over the year and ending 2016 almost exactly where it started it, at 72.4 US cents versus 73 in January.
