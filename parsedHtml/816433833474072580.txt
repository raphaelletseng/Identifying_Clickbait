Leopard runs through Indian city causing chaos, attacks 35 people

A leopard darting through the Indian city of Raiganj has caused mayhem, running through homes and attacking at least 35 people before being confined by wildlife authorities.

The leopard wandered into the city, in the state of West Bengal, at around 9:00am on Monday, and over the next several hours was chased by a huge crowd trying to confine the animal.

Several residents captured video of the chase — one shows the leopard biting a man's hand.

The leopard attacked at least 35 people before it was eventually captured by wildlife officials at about 5:00pm and sent to a local wildlife sanctuary, according to local officials.

Principal conservator of forests in West Bengal, Pradeep Dass, said it was a "freak incident".

"This area has historically had no leopards … There are no forests nearby," he said.

"We believe the leopard travelled here from Bihar. This is the first time a leopard has been spotted here in the last 60 years."

Although leopards are protected in India, their shrinking habitats have led to an increasing number big cats entering cities and villages in search of food — and more run-ins between people and big cats.
