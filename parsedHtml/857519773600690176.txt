Pharrell Williams arrives on the red carpet during the 58th Annual Grammy Music Awards in Los Angeles on Feb. 15, 2016.

Pharrell has made history with his latest foray into fashion, becoming the first man to star in a Chanel bag campaign.Â

The superstar musician is featured in a new short film promoting Chanel's Gabrielle bag, showing him dancing around and causing a little mischief in an empty, pre-show concert venue.Â

The high profile partnership was announced in March, following Pharrell's walking in Chanel's Metiers d'Art runway show in Paris last December. Creative director Karl Lagerfeld told Women's Wear Daily then that in casting Pharrell he wanted to show the Gabrielle bag can be worn in "many different circumstances."Â

"It's not very feminine in the sense of being chichi," he said.Â

Actress Kristen Stewart, model-turned-actress Cara Delevingne and French star Caroline de Maigret will also star in the campaign.Â
