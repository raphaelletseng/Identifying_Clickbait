Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian may not be on speaking terms at the moment, but that didn't throw off E!'s scheduling of their highly anticipated baby special, which aired on Sunday evening. And as expected, the episode drew quite the crowd. Amid their relationship drama that spiraled out of control late last night as a result of Chyna's hacked Instagram account, fans tuned into the network to watch the final moments leading up to the birth of their first child Dream Kardashian.

Viewers got an exclusive sneak peek at Chyna's baby shower as well as her son King Cairo's race car-themed birthday party, where Kylie Jenner and Chyna's mom, Tokyo Toni, were both present. Many members of the Kardashian-Jenner fam also made an appearance on the show in celebration of Dream's arrival. The episode trailed all the way up to when Blac was in labor.

While fans initially took to Twitter to share their thoughts about the special and Dream, the conversation quickly returned to last nights festivities with predictions about the couple's relationship status and whether last night was an early April Fool's Day joke. Some even started calling sides, while others congratulated Kris Jenner for allegedly pulling off a scam that would've made Joanne the Scammer proud.

Up until a couple of minutes before the show, Rob Kardashian seemed to back up the claims that the couple had officially gone their separate ways. The reality star posted a number of images of his infant daughter, with captions signaling how hurt he was that Chyna was keeping him from seeing her. "I really miss this girl, never felt so in love with someone the way I do with you Dream," he wrote on a now-deleted Instagram post of baby Dream. "Never thought a woman would try to take my happiness when all I wanted was to make her happy. Man this is awful... Closing my eyes because this is draining."

Meanwhile, Blac Chyna has appeared to have changed the password on her Instagram and returned to her regularly scheduled postings. Her latest posts follow an alleged comment she made on another page, in which she stated that she was "done" and accused Rob of having mental issues.

The world may never know if those screenshots of Chyna's alleged convos with Young Thug and Jaden Smith were real or if the mom of two actually swiped all of the Eggos out of the fridge. But at least they made a beautiful child out all of this messiness. And hopefully they can come together for her sake if nothing else.
