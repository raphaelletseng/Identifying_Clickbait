People Can Relate Hard To This Raccoon That Got Stuck On A Trash Truck
On Friday, reporter Helena B. Evich tweeted a photo of a sad sight: a poor little raccoon that got stuck on a trash truck while looking for food. This raccoon is having a rough morning-just wanted some trash & ended up in Rosslyn!

>And yes I alerted the driver Evich tweeted she saw the animal in Rossalyn, Virginia. Poor lil‚Äô fella! People immediately felt for the little guy. @hbottemiller @AndyRichter oh poor guy. hope he's okay. And many said they could relate to the raccoon‚Äôs plight. @hbottemiller when you have a brilliant plan that maybe you didn't think all the way through. ‚Äú‚ÄòEverything‚Äôs fine,‚Äô thought the trash panda.
