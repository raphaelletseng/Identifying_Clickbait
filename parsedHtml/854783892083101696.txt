This '13 Reasons Why' Actor Became A Meme For Being Too Grown And Sexy
‚Äú13 Reasons Why‚Äù ‚Äï the mega popular Netflix high school drama ‚Äï is getting a ton of critical buzz for its honest depiction of bullying, sexual assault and suicide. There‚Äôs also something less serious people on Twitter are talking about: How most of the cast members on the show ‚Äï specifically 26-year-old Ross Butler ‚Äï are way too mature-looking to play high schoolers.

(And if you know, please send 15-year-old us there in a time machine.)  My #SpikeSpiegel look for a @wwd feature.
