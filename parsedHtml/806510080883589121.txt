The opinions expressed are those of the writer. Will Japanese tech giant SoftBank pour $50 billion into the U.S.? President-elect Donald Trump claims it will, and says it will create 50,000 domestic jobs in the process. Trump shared the news with reporters (including from CNBC) in the lobby of Trump Tower after SoftBank's billionaire Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son met with the future U.S. president on Tuesday afternoon. The promised money will likely come from a SoftBank global tech investment fund that was announced in October . SoftBank said then that it expects to invest at least $25 billion over five years in technology companies globally , and that the public investment fund of Saudi Arabia might contribute as much as $45 billion to the fund. SoftBank said the fund had the potential to grow as large as $100 billion with contributions from other investors.
