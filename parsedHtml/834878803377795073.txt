Which MLB Team Has the Most Elite Young Talent?
Which MLB Team Has the Most Elite Young Talent?
Which MLB Team Has the Most Elite Young Talent? Our mission: Identify which MLB team has the most elite young talent heading into the 2017 season. First things first, we needed to determine what constitutes "young talent," and for the sake of this exercise, we focused strictly on players 25 years old or younger. That age was based on how old a player will be on June 30 of the upcoming season. From there, we needed to come up with some sort of scoring system to make it easy to compare all 30 teams based on their young talent. Here's what we came up with: (10 points): Players with at least one 5.0 WAR season to their credit or a of at least 5.0 for the upcoming season were worth the most. These players have already established themselves as All-Star level performers or are expected to do so during the upcoming season. A total of 11 players qualified at this level. (5 points): Players with at least one 2.0 WAR season to their credit or a of at least 2.0 for the upcoming season. A 2.0 WAR is generally identified as the baseline for an everyday player and producing at that level before the age of 26 is a good sign of a bright future. (2 points): Players who appear on both the and MLB.com top 100 prospect lists for the 2017 season. (1 point): Players who appear on just one of those top 100 prospect lists for the 2017 season. In the case of two teams having the same number of points, the total number of players that qualified served as the tie-breaker. There were a few players who fell outside of those parameters that probably deserve some attention: Kyle Schwarber (CHC), Nomar Mazara (TEX), Orlando Arcia (MIL) and Jose Berrios (MIN) immediately jump to mind. For the most part, though, that formula provided us with a good picture of how all 30 teams stack up in terms of high-end young talent. So without further ado, here's a look at where all 30 teams ranked, with a full breakdown of the top 10.

Washington Nationals (24 Points) 20 points  4 points  The Washington Nationals would have ranked even higher on this list if they had not traded away a pair of consensus top 100 prospects in Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez in the deal to acquire Adam Eaton from the Chicago White Sox. They still have Bryce Harper, though. The 2016 season was not the encore performance to his 2015 NL MVP he was hoping for, but there's plenty of reason to think he'll bounce back, and his 21.5 career WAR is the second-highest among active players 25 or younger. In almost any other season, Trea Turner would have walked away with Rookie of the Year honors after hitting .342/.370/.567 with 35 extra-base hits and 33 stolen bases in 73 games, but alas, he was matched up against Corey Seager for the honor. A healthy season from Joe Ross could mean a step forward after he went 7-5 with a 3.43 ERA, 1.31 WHIP and 93 strikeouts in 105 innings while being limited to 19 starts a year ago. 9. New York Yankees (24 Points) 10 points  14 points  There's a reason the New York Yankees are focusing on the future as opposed to the present for the first time in recent memory. That future is awfully bright. MLB.com is a bit more bullish on some of their prospects, but no matter how you slice it, they have seven consensus top 100 guys headlining what is undoubtedly one of the deepest farm systems in baseball. Six of those seven guys are in big league camp this spring as fans will get a first-hand look at the wave of young talent that figures to be arriving over the next few seasons. As for this year's team, the main attraction will be Gary Sanchez, after he posted a 1.032 OPS with 20 home runs and 42 RBI in 53 games as a rookie. Will this be the year that Luis Severino finally uses his terrific stuff to lock down a rotation spot? He'll be given every chance this spring with two starting gigs up for grabs. 8. Minnesota Twins (25 Points) 20 points  5 points  Is this the year that Byron Buxton and Miguel Sano finally live up to their top prospect pedigree and take the reins of a Minnesota Twins team that lost 103 games a year ago? Buxton showed some signs of life with a 1.011 OPS with six doubles and nine home runs in September last season, while a full-time move back to third base could help Sano finally settle in at the MLB level. They were both outperformed by Max Kepler last season as he had a .734 OPS with 20 doubles, 17 home runs and 63 RBI to seize the everyday right field job. The projection systems don't love Jose Berrios, but he still has the stuff to emerge as a front-line starter despite a rocky debut last season, so he's one worth keeping an eye on. The same goes for prospect Tyler Jay, though an eventual move to the bullpen could cut into his long-term value. 7. Colorado Rockies (25 Points) 15 points  10 points  It looks like the Colorado Rockies might have finally found their staff ace in right-hander Jon Gray. The 25-year-old went 10-10 with a 4.61 ERA ( 106 ERA+ ), 1.26 WHIP and 185 strikeouts in 168 innings last season, and manager Bud Black thinks he's more than capable of taking that next step. " 6. Boston Red Sox (26 Points) 20 points  6 points  Even while David Ortiz was playing his final seasons in a Boston Red Sox uniform, it was clear a changing of the guard was taking place, as Mookie Betts and Xander Bogaerts took over as the faces of the franchise. Betts was the most dynamic player in baseball not named Mike Trout last season, adding 30-homer power to an already impressive array of tools and finishing second to Trout in AL MVP voting. Bogaerts also muscled up to hit a career-high 21 home runs while ranking second on the team in runs (115) and fourth in RBI (89) to win his second consecutive Silver Slugger. This is another team that would have ranked higher had it not been for a busy offseason on the trade market. Yoan Moncada and Michael Kopech are both consensus top 100 prospects who were shipped to the Chicago White Sox in the Chris Sale blockbuster. Eduardo Rodriguez is the wild card here and perhaps on the Red Sox roster in general. He'll be battling Steven Wright and Drew Pomeranz for a rotation spot this spring and has legitimate front-line potential if everything clicks. Can't forget to mention No. 1 overall prospect Andrew Benintendi, who will break camp as the starting left fielder and heavy favorite for AL Rookie of the Year honors. 5. St. Louis Cardinals (28 Points) 20 points  8 points  Unfortunately, Alex Reyes won't be suiting up for the St. Louis Cardinals this season, as he's headed for season-ending Tommy John surgery. He's still an incredibly valuable asset with a bright future, though. Michael Wacha and Randal Grichuk have both plateaued a bit as far as their development is concerned, but the same can't be said for emerging ace Carlos Martinez. The 25-year-old signed a five-year, $51 million extension this winter that includes a pair of option years that could keep him in St. Louis through 2023. That's a huge investment in someone who was headed to arbitration for the first time, but he's made it clear he's a long-term piece. The continued development of catching prospect Carson Kelly will be worth monitoring closely, as incumbent backstop Yadier Molina gets set to enter his age-34 season. 4. Philadelphia Phillies (28 Points) 20 points  7 points  The Philadelphia Phillies are several years into the rebuilding process, and they may finally be ready to start pushing back toward contention after adding a handful of solid veteran pieces to the young core this offseason. That being said, it's the continued progression of that young core that will ultimately determine when they're ready to contend again. Aaron Nola and Vincent Velasquez both showed flashes of front-line potential last season but wore out down the stretch and dealt with some arm issues as well. The ZiPS model is particularly bullish on Nola, whose 3.9 zWAR ranks 15th among all starting pitchers for the upcoming season. Prospects J.P. Crawford and Jorge Alfaro should settle in at the MLB level at some point during the upcoming season, while Maikel Franco will look to improve on a somewhat disappointing .733 OPS from a year ago. Odubel Herrera is already one of the greatest success stories in Rule 5 draft history, and the Phillies rewarded him with a five-year, $30.5 million extension in the offseason. 3. Los Angeles Dodgers (29 Points) 20 points  9 points  Corey Seager did not look like a rookie last season en route to unanimous NL Rookie of the Year honors and a third-place finish in NL MVP voting. The 22-year-old hit .308/.365/.512 with 40 doubles, 26 home runs, 72 RBI and 105 runs scored, and he's capable of even more as he continues to grow into his power. After falling flat in the second half of his rookie season, Joc Pederson bounced back nicely to post an .847 OPS with 26 doubles and 25 home runs as the one stable piece in the Dodgers outfield last season. The biggest question here might be just how good Julio Urias can be in his second season. There's been some talk of leaving the left-hander back at extended spring training in an effort to limit his innings, as the Dodgers will continue to treat the young phenom with kid gloves. At some point, he's going to force their hands. Even with Seager, Pederson and Urias graduating the minor league ranks in recent years and Jose De Leon traded away this offseason, the farm system is still loaded with high-end talent. 2. Houston Astros (30 Points) 20 points  10 points  It's borderline ridiculous that an .811 OPS with 20 home runs and 96 RBI from a 21-year-old in his first full MLB season was considered by most to be a disappointing performance. That's the level of expectation that has been heaped on Carlos Correa. The thing is, he has the tools to back it up, and a run at AL MVP this season seems well within reach as he continues to ascend to superstardom. Joining him on the left side of the infield will be Alex Bregman, who began his MLB career with a 2-for-38 slump last season, then hit .313/.354/.577 with 13 doubles, eight home runs and 34 RBI in his final 39 games. On the pitching side, a healthy season from Lance McCullers will be a major X-factor for the starting rotation. Otherwise, they could be counting on the midseason arrivals of Francis Martes and David Paulino to give the staff a needed shot in the arm. 1. Chicago Cubs (34 Points) 25 points  9 points  No big surprise here, right? Even with Anthony Rizzo and Kyle Hendricks not part of this conversation as 27-year-olds, the Chicago Cubs still have the most impressive collection of young talent in the league. Kris Bryant has already reached that upper echelon of players, and Addison Russell has all the tools to join him in the not-too-distant future. Even without a set position, Javier Baez managed to produce a 3.4 WAR last season, before breaking out in a big way during the team's impressive postseason run. Willson Contreras could immediately become one of the league's most productive catchers, as he gets set to handle the bulk of the catching duties this season, following the retirement of David Ross. Not mentioned here is 23-year-old Kyle Schwarber, who had a 1.2 WAR as a rookie and has a 1.5 zWAR . He didn't fit the criteria for this exercise, but you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't consider him to be an "elite young talent" as well. Even with all that young talent at the MLB level, the farm system is still stocked with quality talent as well, including one of the game's elite prospects in outfielder Eloy Jimenez. The past may have been ugly, but the present and future look incredibly bright for the North Siders.  Like the new article format? Send us feedback ! Where can I comment?
