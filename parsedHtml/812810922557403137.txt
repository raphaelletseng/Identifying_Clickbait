Child monks punch each other in a savage bare-knuckle boxing match


Shocking footage has emerged of child monks punching each other in the head a bare-knuckle fight club-style boxing match.

A clip shot in the grounds of a temple shows the children in red robes and shaven heads repeatedly hit and kick each other.

A group of older monks stand around laughing with one of them 'refereeing' the fight by pulling them apart then letting them loose on each other.

It is said that the boys were 'training for Buddhist roles'.

A Buddhist named Khun Kampon shot the footage in Udon Thani, northern Thailand.

He said: 'They start fight club when they're young. It's a good way to make them tough.'

Buddhism has long been associated with martial arts with monks at China's Shaolin temple studying and practicing Kung Fu daily to train the body and improve discipline.

The normal minimum age to be fully ordained is 20 but in Thailand it is fairly common for boys older than eight to take temporary vows.

This means they become novice monks for a short time without being ordained.

They may do this just for a few days when a parent or grandparent has passed away.
