Watch Joey Badass Freestyle Over Future's "Mask Off"
Joey Badass stopped by Power 106 Los Angeles earlier this month to discuss his upcoming album , his controversial 2Pac comments, and the backstory to J. Cole using the “Waves” beat on “False Prophets.” But Joey wasn’t only interested in conversation. During his appearance, the Pro Era member spit a few bars over Future’s flute-filled “Mask Off” beat . “Finally got a piece of the profit/Wine and cheese and a seat by the cockpit/I ain’t mean for your bitch to be watching/I ain’t mean she kept eyeing me/Every day we just making deep profits/Money long, I’m going into some deep pockets/Hands to the ceiling when I’m in the building, how you make a living,” Joey raps over the Metro Boomin instrumental. “[…] Radios be lacking dough/You can’t front on talent so/I’m kill like every show and any foe with any flow/No flex when I be in the zone/Know to watch when I come on/I check in on the microphone/Collect this check, then I’m heading home." The freestyle is definitely worth multiple replays and will no doubt get fans even more hyped about Joey’s sophomore album . While you wait for the project’s release (April 7), you can watch his “Mask Off” freestyle above.
