Polar bear cub waves at German zoo which is asking for public to name it
Polar bear cub gives a wave to the cameras during medical check


An adorable polar bear cub looked content while undergoing a medical inspection to check its condition and sex, even appearing to give a wave to the cameras.

The yet to be named cub was born on November 3 to Tonja and first presented to the world in December last year.

Despite the check-up another examination at the end of the month will be needed to clearly determine the sex of the newborn.

A wave to its fans? The fluff ball raises its paw to the camera looking as though it is acknowledging the photographer's presence

The two-month-old fluff ball still has a wobbly crawl but zookeepers say it will be walking with increased stability in the coming weeks as its continues maturing.

The now 67 centimetre long predator was born in Berlin's Tierpark Zoo and the zoo has launched a campaign asking public for name suggestions for the cub.

Dr Knieriem from the zoo said this is the first polar bear litter the park has had in 22 years, so this particular cub is very special.

Video footage of the bear surfaced last month of falling flat on its legs after it attempted to get up in the enclosure.

The bear and its mother 'will emerge from the mothering den, and be on view for visitors, for the first time on Friday, 24 February,' says zoo director Rasem Baban.
