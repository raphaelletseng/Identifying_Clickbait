German police shoot cyclist who had a rubber horror mask


German police shot a cyclist carrying a rubber horror mask who tried to flee across a field after officers attempted to stop him.

The huge police operation occurred on Wednesday and involved the elite SEK, usually deployed in terrorism and hostage situations.

There has been no official line regarding the incident, leading to speculation the man - who was wounded and underwent emergency surgery for his injuries - was a terror suspect.

Two armed police officers make their way up the embankment in pursuit of the cyclist

The operation to seize him was launched after he rode a bicycle on to the A52 autobahn near Gelsenkirchen.

When police chased after him he abandoned his bike, ran up an embankment and sprinted across fields.

That was when police opened fire on him.

Among his possessions police found a rubber 'horror' mask.

A police spokesman was unable to say why 30 SEK officers were deployed to catch one rogue cyclist and said an investigation was 'ongoing'.

The man was shot at 5.30pm and the motorway stayed closed for seven hours.

He is said to be in a stable condition.
