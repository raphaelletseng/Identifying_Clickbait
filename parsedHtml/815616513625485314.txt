Odd Lots: How an Old-School Chess Shop Survives in Modern New York
Every week, hosts Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway take you on a not-so-random walk through hot topics in markets, finance, and economics. At a time when retail sales are dominated by online behemoths like Amazon Inc. and big chain stores, independent brick-and-mortar shops are under growing pressure. Imad Khachan defies the odds to run the Chess Forum in New York’s Greenwich Village. Here, chess fans can buy game sets or compete against each other for a small fee. It’s an old-fashioned business model under assault by the digital world on two fronts as more chess players opt to compete online. We talk with Khachan about the challenges of running his dark horse-enterprise in an increasingly online market.
