How beauty icons have shaped the makeup industry


Much has changed for women in the past 100 years, from winning the right to vote to accessing the pill.

And from wartime rationing to women's rights, these events have changed not only their daily lives but had a lasting impact on their make-up bags, too.

Experts at cosmetics retailer Beauty Flash have delved into the archives to reveal how western beauty has changed with the times - and the icons who epitomised each look.

From pencil-thin eyebrows to red lips and '70s disco culture, we reveal how beauty has evolved over the past century.

1910s

American ballroom dancing legend and actress Irene Castle (1893 - 1969) epitomised western beauty during the 1910s. The Broadway star and all-round trendsetter helped popularise shorter skirts and loose, elasticised corsets and was credited with introducing American women to the bob at a time when makeup was becoming mainstream among everyday women

1920s

For Hollywood icon Clara Blow, who rose to stardom in silent films during the 1920s, facial expressions were hugely important and her wide eyes and arched, heavily-pencilled eyebrows were vital for helping to frame her face. Meanwhile, women's post-war lifestyles had begun to celebrate individuality through fashion and makeup like never before

1930s

Three-time Oscar nominee Joan Crawford (c. 1908-1977) is synonymous with the Golden Age of Hollywood thanks, in part, to her striking beauty look which favoured dark eyebrows, thick clumpy eyelashes. She was also a pioneer of soft grey eyeshadow and heavily-lined lips

1940s

Beauty supplies were scarce during wartime rationing which forced women to adopt a more neutral look, and Grace Kelly's (1929-1982) understated elegance - even after she married into Monaco's fabulously wealthy royal family - was a source of inspiration to women the world over

1950s

The 1950s saw the introduction of high-voltage glamour thanks to the dawn of colour cinema, with sirens like Marilyn Monroe (1926-1962) leading the way. The blonde sex symbol, with her impossibly long lashes and bright red pout, championed a flawless glamour not seen before

1960s

In the 1960s, vampy glamour made way for a simpler, low-maintenance look. The emphasis was on dramatic eyes, with supermodel Twiggy (b. 1949) showcasing thick, clumpy lashes and heavy liner along with her boyish pixie cut as women's rights movements began to take off

1970s

The birth of disco in the 1970s gave rise to big hair, bright colours and glitter galore. Jerry Hall (b. 1956), who had graced more than 40 magazine covers by 1977, was the undisputed beauty icon of the decade thanks, in part, to her high-profile relationship with Mick Jagger

1980s

Stars like Blondie's Debbie Harry (b. 1945) championed girl power during a time when women were gaining stronger roles in the world of work. Her choppy bold lips and colourful eyeshadow defined the edgy, rock 'n' roll glamour that were an integral part of her look

1990s

The so-called 'age of the supermodel' during the 1990s saw waif-like catwalk queens like Kate Moss (b.1974) taking centre stage. Thin eyebrows, smoky eyes and lip liner were once again the order of the day while grunge and goth culture also had their moment

2000s

Pop princesses like Britney Spears (b.1981) had their heyday in the early noughties, with glitter, shimmer and lip gloss contributing to their ultra-girly image - not to mention lashings of fake tan
