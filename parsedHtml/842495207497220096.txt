Donald Trump is killing Meals on Wheels and it's a serious problem
Put impaired veterans, elderly shut-ins and those who cannot leave their homes on the long list of Americans that the president doesn't seem to want to support. President Trump is ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî coming under fire again for a newly proposed budget that would completely eliminate federal funding for the Meals on Wheels program. That's a problem. SEE ALSO: Texas legislator expertly trolls Republicans with bill that would fine men for masturbating Meals on Wheels provides food to the elderly, poor, disabled, veterans and others who often cannot leave their homes or prepare their own meals. Beyond providing nutritious food for the seniors, the service also supplies those that may lack social interactions with a friendly visit from a volunteer and a safety check to ensure they are okay. Under Trump's proposed budget, the entirety of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program would be eliminated. These grants fund services for low-income Americans ‚Äî including grants for Meals on Wheels. Because Meals on Wheels programs are typically funded by several sources, it's thankfully improbable that that Trump's cuts would end the services altogether, but the number of people the program is able to serve would be greatly reduced.
