‘Buffy, the Vampire Slayer’ Cast Before They Came to Sunnydale
Before the evening of March 10, 1997, Sarah Michelle Gellar was a former child actress and soap opera star searching for her breakout role. After that night she became immortalized as Buffy Summers, slayer of vampires and leader of the Scooby gang. The premiere of on The WB exactly twenty years ago today transformed Gellar and the rest of the show’s cast into genre show royalty, who will be permanently identified with their characters for the rest of their careers. On the show’s 20th anniversary, we look back at who they were before they became part of .

Before Buffy she was: Sydney Orion Rutledge (Swans Crossing, 1992); Kendall Hart (All My Children, 1993-1995) Landing her first acting gigs at the tender age of 4, Gellar graduated into soap operas during her teen years, first on the short-lived syndicated teen sudser, Swans Crossing, playing the wealthy scion of the titular seaside town’s mayor. But her most famous pre-Buffy character (who is arguably still more famous than Buffy for a certain demo of the viewing public) is Kendall Hart, long-lost “bad girl” daughter of All My Children‘s reigning queen, Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). Gellar originated the role, which was later taken over by Alice Minshew, and even returned to the soap prior to its 2011 series finale for a cameo as a mental patient who believes she sees — you guessed it — vampires.
