13 Survivors Share Their Memories Of Sexual Assault & No Words Can Describe How It Feels
13 Survivors Share Their Memories Of Sexual Assault & No Words Can Describe How It Feels Sexual assault is a subject many refuse to talk about. The emotions can become too overpowering to let words describe them - the pain, the memories, the survivor's guilt, the horror. To that end, this project called 'Project Unbreakable' - that was started by a New York photography student, Grace Brown in 2011 - aims at spreading awareness about sexual assault through people who, unfortunately, fell prey to it. The following pictures show these very victims holding up posters with words that their attackers used on them and went on to violate their rights. #1 A photo posted by Project Unbreakable (@projectunbreakable) on Feb 2, 2017 at 8:03pm PST   #2 A photo posted by Project Unbreakable (@projectunbreakable) on Jan 31, 2017 at 5:26am PST   #3 A photo posted by Project Unbreakable (@projectunbreakable) on Jan 30, 2017 at 6:39am PST   #4 A photo posted by Project Unbreakable (@projectunbreakable) on Jan 29, 2017 at 11:35am PST   #5 A photo posted by Project Unbreakable (@projectunbreakable) on Jan 26, 2017 at 11:47am PST   #6 A photo posted by Project Unbreakable (@projectunbreakable) on Jan 25, 2017 at 6:22pm PST   #7 A photo posted by Project Unbreakable (@projectunbreakable) on Jan 24, 2017 at 7:44am PST   #8 A photo posted by Project Unbreakable (@projectunbreakable) on Jan 19, 2017 at 9:02am PST   #9 A photo posted by Project Unbreakable (@projectunbreakable) on Jan 15, 2017 at 3:07pm PST
