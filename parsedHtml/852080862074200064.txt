Tweet     Stumble     Email  Tired and ready for bed, Cary McCook waved goodbye to his friend who dropped him off in front of his hotel when he saw a large shadow coming his way.

I was like, ‘Was that a deer?’” Shocked and pumped full of adrenaline after the tackle, McCook called his family to tell them about his strange encounter.

Still see the deer fur on my arm,” he wrote. “April Fools,” a friend joked. Determined to prove himself, McCook decided to reach out to the hotel manager in hopes of finding a surveillance video. Sure enough, around 9:00 p.m. on April 1, he was caught on camera getting knocked down by a deer. “Oh, you got hit by a deer!” a woman at the front desk yelled while reviewing the footage. McCook recorded a clip of the video on his phone, proving once and for all he wasn’t lying.
