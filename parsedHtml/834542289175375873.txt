The opinions expressed are those of the writer. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway substantially increased its holdings of Apple stock in the December quarter. While Berkshire’s purchase of Apple shares were probably done by Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler, two of Buffett’s portfolio managers, it is a further commitment to technology stocks that Buffett had previously sworn off. Berkshire Hathaway initially got into Apple’s shares during the first quarter of 2016 by buying 9.8 million shares for about $1.1 billion. It increased its holdings to 15.2 million shares in the second quarter and substantially increased it to 57.3 million shares , which are now worth about $7.8 billion, by December. While the SEC filing does not provide purchase prices based on the jump in Apple’s shares since the beginning of the year (and assuming no changes to its holdings) the 18% rise in the stock has generated over $1 billion in profits.
