Former choirboy 'who became a chief headhunter for ISIS' arrested


A former choirboy who became a chief headhunter for Islamic State and one of France's most-wanted terrorists has handed himself into police claiming he has been reformed.

Kevin G, 24, who converted to Islam a decade ago, has been charged with financing terrorism and recruiting jihadis for both al-Qaeda and Islamic State having been placed on the UN's blacklist in 2014.

The former church choirboy reportedly socialised with the November 2015 Paris attackers during his time in Syria, though it is not clear whether or not he was directly involved.

The jihadi is thought to have been in charge of getting young French people to sign up to terrorism in Syria and Iraq, according to France 24.

He spent four years in Syria before leaving with his four French wives and their six children for Turkey last year.

They were all arrested and the wives sent back to France.

Kevin G's case is being handled by the Paris prosecutor, and the jihadi claims to have turned his back on terrorism.

He is said to have told detectives he walked away from ISIS because he feared being killed.

Officials must now determine whether he has genuinely reformed or whether it was a deliberate ploy to return to Europe as part of a sleeper cell.

He was born in Brittany and raised by a single mother before converting to Islam.
