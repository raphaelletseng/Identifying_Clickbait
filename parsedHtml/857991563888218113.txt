A luxury music festival where tickets cost up to $12,000 turned into a nightmare â here's what happened


Instead of dancing on the white-sand beaches of Great Exuma in the Bahamas, Fyre Festival-goers have found themselves stranded in airports without any food or water, unable to get home.

This three-day party,Â organized by Ja Rule and tech entrepreneur Billy McFarland's Fyre Media company,Â was due to take place on a private beach in the Bahamas for two weekendsÂ (April 28-30 and May 5-7).Â
