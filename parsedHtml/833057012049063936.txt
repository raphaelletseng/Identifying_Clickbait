White Night Melbourne: City's iconic buildings and streets ablaze with light shows

Posted

Melbourne's biggest arts festival attracted hundred of thousands of people last night, as the city's most iconic buildings were brought to life with spectacular light shows.

It was the fifth edition of White Night Melbourne and streets, parks, laneways and cultural landmarks were filled with every art form imaginable.

The Royal Exhibition Building, State Library and Flinders Street Station were among buildings used as canvasses for moving light shows combined with sound.

Live music, dancing and street performers also drew big crowds.

The twelve-hour festival ran from dawn till dusk and streets were blocked off.

International visitors to the city were particularly impressed.

Cat Miller from England said she had loved the light shows and the festival showed Melbourne as an exciting city.

"It brings everyone together, so it's really nice," she said.

White Night was originally conceived in Paris in 2002 and is now held in more than 20 cities around the world.
