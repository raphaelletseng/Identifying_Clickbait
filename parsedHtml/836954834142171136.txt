Facebook has a new app for the Apple TV â here's what it looks like


Facebook is now available on your Apple TV.

The app, which the company first announced two weeks ago, lets you watch videos from your friends and pages you follow. Facebook will recommend videos based on what you watch and also show the top live videos on its network.

Facebook's TV app was released for Samsung smart TVs on Monday, and now Apple is promoting the app in the Apple TV's App Store.

This new app is the first time Facebook has made a standalone app for TVs, and it's part of the company's strategy to become more of a YouTube-like destination for watching longer videos. Facebook is reportedly talking to MLB about live streaming at least one baseball game per week, and it recently hired an executive from MTV to help produce original shows.
