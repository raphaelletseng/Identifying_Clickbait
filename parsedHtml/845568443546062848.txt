Which TV mum are you?
eing a mum may be the most important job in the world, but let’s be honest, it’s seldom a walk in the park - even on the days when you do actually go for a walk in the park. And the most common question we ask ourselves (apart from ‘where did I put the car key?’ and ‘why did I come upstairs?’) is: am I getting it right? Because there is no single, foolproof template for mothering. There are, instead, multiple different types of mother, a fact reflected by the colourful array of mum characters on our TV screens. So which one are you? Take our highly scientific personality test to find out.
