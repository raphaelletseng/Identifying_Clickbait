Cardinals' Yadier Molina Can't Find Baseball Stuck to His Chest Protector
ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” https://t.co/2oHBDV6q8q It's not often Yadier Molina gets flustered behind home plate. The St. Louis Cardinals catcher has seen just about everything over his 14-year careerâ€”except for a ball sticking to his chest protector. Cardinals reliever Brett Cecil opened the seventh inning by striking out Chicago Cubs pinch hitter Matt Szczur. The pitch bounced in front of the plate, and Szczur reached first safely when the eight-time Gold Glove recipient couldn't locate the ball. Molina eventually realized it was attached to his protective equipment. The inning spiraled out of control for the Cardinals, who lost their 4-2 lead when Kyle Schwarber smashed a three-run home run off Cecil. The defending champions received some good fortune to score one of the frame's four runs. [ MLB ] Like the new article format? Send us feedback ! Where can I comment?
