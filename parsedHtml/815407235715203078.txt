5 of the Biggest Celebrity Real Estate Buys of 2016


Living the luxurious life of a celebrity usually includes having a sweet pad. And in 2016, plenty of stars traded up for even sweeter pads. Here are five of the biggest real estate buys of the year.

1. Kendall Jenner

The supermodel’s star continues to rise, and this past year she dropped a cool $6.5 million on a new Los Angeles home. Complete with six bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths, the mansion was previously occupied by John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. Jenner immediately decorated the place with a bizarre $60,000 couch that is either really comfortable or completely unbearable.

2. Adele

It’s no surprise that Adele’s got money (she’s basically made of platinum records at this point), but she recently splurged on a $9.5 million home in Beverly Hills. And with a second baby reportedly coming in the near future, 6,500 square feet is probably enough for several nurseries. Another bonus: Jennifer Lawrence and Zoe Saldana are neighbors. Pretty much the best block party ever.

3. John Legend and Chrissy Teigen

These two lovebirds spent a fortune ($14.1 million) on a new home in Los Angeles as well. The mansion has a musical past too — Rihanna lived there in 2009, but left because of reported water damage.

4. Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen

What does $20 million get you in Manhattan? Not as much as you might think. The couple picked up a place that overlooks the Hudson, but at only 5,000 square feet, the home doesn’t offer quite as much bang for the buck as some sprawling L.A. estates do.

5. Jennifer Lopez

The international superstar bought a massive eight-acre property in the über-private L.A. neighborhood of Bel Air. It boasts a mix of rustic and island chic (there’s a tiki bar, naturally) and includes a 100-seat outdoor amphitheater. J.Lo bought it from actress Sela Ward for $28 million.
