Woman Blames Car Crash On Bigfoot
Driver: Bigfoot Caused Me To Crash My Car!
An Idaho motorist told the local sheriff’s department that a Bigfoot sighting caused her to crash her car last Wednesday night. According to Pullman Radio, the woman, who was not identified, told the Latah County Sheriff’s Office that she saw a Sasquatch chasing a deer on a stretch of US-95 outside of Potlatch. She said the creature was “shaggy” and between 7 and 8 feet tall, the Moscow-Pullman Daily News reported. The woman checked her mirrors to see the Bigfoot, but as her eyes re-adjusted to the road she hit the deer with her Subaru Forester, the newspaper said. Pullman Radio reported that the woman continued driving, picked up her husband from work then drove to the sheriff’s office to report the incident. Officers did not find any evidence of Bigfoot at the scene of the crash. The radio station reported that the 50-year-old driver suffered a “minor neck injury.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST The Legend of Bigfoot Continues       Share this slide:       MORE:

Bigfoot Raises Its Hairy Head To Kick Off 2014

You just can't keep a good, hairy beast down -- that is, unless it's allegedly real, and it's supposedly dead. 2014 got off to a big, Bigfoot start, with promoter Rick Dyer claiming to have killed one of the beasts and was taking the body on tour for the public to pay and see (including its less than stellar manhood). Problem was, when push came to shove, Dyer apparently couldn't get many venues interested enough in his Bigfoot traveling show , and it ended up being a no-show. Dyer eventually admitted to the hoax.
