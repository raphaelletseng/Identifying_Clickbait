The thing that is usually good about April Fool’s Day is that it is just one day. But 2017 has taken even that from us. Because the hoax-filled “holiday” falls on a Saturday this year, a number of this year’s jokes have rolled out early. Some pranks launched on Friday, while others went live even earlier in the week.

As we have in years past, The Intersect is keeping a running tab on all the pranks we can find (or, more often, jokes that are pitched to us by brands). We’ve begun our tracking of this hoax wasteland a day early to account for all the stuff that crept into March.

[April Fools’ Day is a garbage holiday. Here is its terrible history.]

Below is our list, so far, of all the April Fools’ pranks on the Internet this year, broken up into a few categories.

Whether you’ve come here to fact check something you read online that seems a bit off, or because you just like to watch the world burn, we hope this list will be helpful over the next couple of days.

And may God have mercy on our souls.

Tech and Web:

Google

Politics!

From Whopper toothpaste to Puppy Mudder, here are some of the funniest fake April Fools' Day ads this year. (The Washington Post)

Miscellaneous Brands:

Animal jokes

Fake wearables, “smart” items, and AI jokes:

Fake “news” and history

Messing with children:

“Blorskee” “Tangeteen” and “Speekuzslmn” (pronounced “speak-ew”) are not real words, much to the relief of the students who took this joke spelling test in class.

Ikea Singapore angered a bunch of parents by “announcing” that they were replacing their kids’ play area with a bunch of pods, so kids could isolate themselves with their tablets.
