George RR Martin: 'I think Winds of Winter will be out this year'
George RR Martin: 'I think Winds of Winter will be out this year'
on't get too excited, Game of Thrones fans, but there may be a new offering from George RR Martin by the end of the year. The author, whose A Song of Ice and Fire novels have inspired the wildly successful Game of Thrones television series, has given the closest thing to an update on his latest book's progress – more than a year after he broke the news that he had missed several deadlines. The book in question is the sixth in the Songs of Ice and Fire series, and called Winds of Winter. It is expected to be the penultimate novel in the planned series, followed by A Dream of Spring. However, Martin, who admits that he has "always had problems with deadlines", has struggled with its writing, explaining in January 2016: I grew unhappy with some of the choices I'd made and began to revise... and suddenly it was October, and then November... and as the suspicion grew that I would not make it after all, a gloom set in, and I found myself struggling even more. The fewer the days, the greater the stress, and the slower the pace of my writing became. However, there does seem to be some hope in sight. While responding to a fan who commented on his blog post, Martin wrote : "Not done yet, but I've made progress. But not as much as I hoped a year ago, when I thought to be done by now. I think it will be out this year. (But hey, I thought the same thing last year).” The news comes after an update a few weeks ago, when Martin said that the tone of the sixth book would be darker than its prequels : "in any story, the classic structure is, ‘Things get worse before they get better,’ so things are getting worse for a lot of people." Even if Winds of Winter is released this year, the events of the TV series have already overtaken the events of the novels. Martin has been cooperating with Game of Thrones' producers to potentially steer them towards plot points that will happen in his books. The update may be a cautious one, but that hasn't stopped fans from becoming excited by the news on social media: THE WINDS OF WINTER MIGJT BE PUBLISHED THIS YEAR MCFREAKING FINALLY OH MY@GODDDD George RR Martin said winds of winter will be out this year 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/WngRwwLeKO When you're dead inside but George RR Martin announces he'll finish Winds of Winter this year: pic.twitter.com/IPBbqs7fx3 If George RR Martin gets his new book out this year I'll dance down the street singing the Dornishman's Wife #windsofwinter george. george rr martin. my mate. my friend. please do the winds of winter. pls finish that book. it's been 6 years since the last one. pls
