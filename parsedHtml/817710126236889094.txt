Neo-Nazi arrested on suspicion of planning attack with huge explosives


Police in Germany have arrested a neo-Nazi teenager and his accomplice suspected of planning an attack with 300lbs of explosives.

Armed officers seized 'industrial strength' illegal fireworks and other 'explosive materials' from an apartment in the quiet town of Lauterecken in the far west of Germany two days before New Year's Eve.

Police said some material was 'illegally acquired' - understood to be fireworks from Poland - and some 'illegally manufactured' in his home.

Their target was believed to be the nearby city of Kaiserslautern. The 18-year-year old is now in police custody along with his sidekick, a 24-year-old man from North Rhine-Westphalia.

They are being held for breaching explosives regulations and plotting an act of terrorism - namely 'a serious act of violence against the state,' according to prosecutors.

Islamist extremism has been ruled out and the investigation has turned to the far-right scene in Germany. 'The neo-Nazi scene is the focus of enquiries,' a police source told local media.

Police were forced to evacuate nearly 100 homes from the apartment where the teen lived because of the risk of detonation of the seized material.

It was taken from his home piecemeal by a crocodile of police officers handling the volatile substances with extreme care.
