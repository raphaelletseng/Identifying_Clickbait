WATCH: Kid Skips School To See Springsteen, Ends Up Performing With Him
An Australian teen got the rock-and-roll lesson of a lifetime when he was tutored by none other than Bruce Springsteen on stage in front of thousands of people. Nathan Testa, 14, was at The Boss’ show at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre last Thursday when he held up a sign saying he had skipped school to be there and wanted to play “Growin’ Up” with Springsteen, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. “Do you know the song? You do?” Springsteen asked from the stage. “You know it on guitar? You do? Come on up!” Testa not only played the song with Springsteen and the E Street Band, he even received a few lessons in how to hold the guitar like a rock star:  Testa also joined Springsteen on stage four years ago , at the age of 11, to sing “Waitin’ On A Sunny Day.” It’s not clear if the latest stunt was pre-planned, or if Testa was simply extra lucky, but Springsteen has a long history of making his fans’ dreams come true on stage.
