4 lessons about how millennials spend money from MTV's new reality competition show


MTV's new show, "Stranded with a Million Dollars," serves up a twist on the reality survival show.

On the new series, which airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m., 10 millennials from diverse backgrounds accept the challenge of living on the island of Taveuni, Fiji. But they're also given a total of $1 million to spend on a variety of food, tools, and luxuries at outrageous prices. In the end, those who are able to last for 40 days will get to divide whatever's left of the million-dollar bounty.

With its million-dollar twist and the tough living conditions, viewers get an ampleÂ look atÂ the cast members' attitudes toward money.

"I was guilty of the preconceived notion that millennials are lazy and don't understand the value of money," "Stranded" creator Kevin Lee recently told Business Insider. "And what happened during the 40 days that we were filming in the woods is that I learned that was wrong. That notion was wrong."

Reactions to the harsh environment and the financial windfall are captured by the show's use of flying drones and automatic cameras.

"On any given day, there's approximately 30 cameras in play that don't have humans holding them," Lee said. "That made all the difference in the world... I think they headed toward more extreme behavior because they didn't feel that they were being judged by the human holding the camera. When there's just a robot camera, they don't care what the robot thinks."
