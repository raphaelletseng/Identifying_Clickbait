Gaga, who was then the face of Versace's spring campaign, donned a crystal-hooded dress that provided stark contrast to her pale face and platinum hair -- and the long train she held with her fingers only added to the drama. The star was an alabaster vision in this custom strapless dress from stylist Brandon Maxwell's debut collection. "It was the finale look, so we did it in white for her," he says. The voluminous sleeves, which connected across her back, heightened the glamour. Like Gaga herself, the look defied expectations -- is it a tuxedo? A dress? Are those fishnets? -- but the sum total of the outfit is classic Gaga. A plunging black jacket with strong shoulder pads was at once severe and feminine. She looked every bit the refined woman in this keyhole gown with pleated bodice and bejeweled waistband that was made edgy with sunglasses and a -era Michelle Pfeiffer haircut. The kimono-inspired, custom Alexander Wang number with a feathered and crystal-embellished jacket amazed with its sheer volume. "They sat together and went through every fabric, every jewel," says Maxwell. "It was very collaborative." For her showstopping Oscars moment, the singer wore a custom dress with the red leather gloves that launched a thousand memes. "It was the first time [Alaia] had done an Oscar dress," says Maxwell. "It took six people to put [it] over her head."  FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS
