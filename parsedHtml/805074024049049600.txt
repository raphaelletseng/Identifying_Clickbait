video shows 100 years of French beauty condensed into just two minutes By Unity Blott For Mailonline  |           61 View comments  Model Corina's first transformation is this elegant 1910s look, where her hair is styled before being placed under a wide-brimmed red hat Next is the bold 1920s flapper look, with pin curls and bright red lips as well as dark eyes The 1920s look is completed with a dramatic jewelled headpiece that drapes around the hair and forehead The curls drop for the 1930s transformation, but they are not wasted as the lift it gave the roots will help the next look In the 1930s section, Corina keeps the bright lip but the eyes soften, with her hair pinned underneath There are strings of pearls draped around Corina's neck, a sign of the wealth between the wars On to 1945, and there is a striking difference in the two sides of France in this World War Two era The decade was marked by a divide between occupied France, which fell to the Nazis, and Vichy France, right In 1945, Corina's look represents the emotion and freedom that came towards the end of the war On to the 1950s, where make-up artists and hair stylists give Corina a mature look, with simpler make-up Gone is the bright lipstick, replaced with a more natural shade, and her hair is carefully tucked under RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next          Share this article The 1960s was a time of extravagance, and Corina gets a big beehive and plenty of waves to show this The 1960s was marked by the hippy movement and Corina's make-up and hair is the perfect fit Pale lipstick adds to the sultriness of the 1960s and its new found freedoms across France On to disco 1970s, with a sleeker hair style and a rebirth of some bold lip colours, seen here matched with dark eyes Corina peers over the top of brilliant blue 1970s shades, which are a trademark design of the era In the 1980s,  Corina wears minimal make-up and an easy, everyday plait that airs to the more practical side of beauty Time to party in the 1990s, where hair came down but stayed straight and natural, and there wasn't a huge amount more make-up The dark lip takes centre stage and Corina accessorises with a heart shaped pendant on a choker Ready to bring in the new millenium, Corina gets the chop with the addition of a fringe and choppy layers Her layers are twisted into light waves, a nod to the boho looks that dominated the festival scenes Corina did find out that layers can be a problem though, as she blows one piece of hair out of her face The last look is the modern day, where Corina has long locks and a bold choice in make-up, taking it right back to the 1910s and 1920s Share or comment on this article
