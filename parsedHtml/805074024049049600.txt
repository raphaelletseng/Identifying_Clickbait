100 years of beauty condensed into two minutes
100 years of French beauty condensed into two minutes


A lot can change in 100 years - and this mesmerising video showing a century of beauty condensed into two minutes is testament to that.

Focusing on iconic looks from the past ten decades in France, the video showcases just how much beauty has changed over the years, focusing on different eras.

It is just the latest in a series of films by WatchCut which aim to show how beauty has evolved all around the world, from Germany to Brazil.

Model Corina's first transformation is this elegant 1910s look, where her hair is styled before being placed under a wide-brimmed red hat

Next is the bold 1920s flapper look, with pin curls and bright red lips as well as dark eyes

The 1920s look is completed with a dramatic jewelled headpiece that drapes around the hair and forehead

Beginning with the 1910s, model Corina is seen modelling a broad-rimmed hat, with a pale complexion and lightly rouged cheeks, typical of that era.

Makeup artists vamp her look up as she moves into the 1920s with dark red lips, smoky eyes and crimped hair worn in a tight pixie crop with a flapper-style headband.

The curls drop for the 1930s transformation, but they are not wasted as the lift it gave the roots will help the next look

In the 1930s section, Corina keeps the bright lip but the eyes soften, with her hair pinned underneath

There are strings of pearls draped around Corina's neck, a sign of the wealth between the wars

On to 1945, and there is a striking difference in the two sides of France in this World War Two era

The decade was marked by a divide between occupied France, which fell to the Nazis, and Vichy France, right

In 1945, Corina's look represents the emotion and freedom that came towards the end of the war

On to the 1950s, where make-up artists and hair stylists give Corina a mature look, with simpler make-up

Gone is the bright lipstick, replaced with a more natural shade, and her hair is carefully tucked under

The next decade sees Corina ramping up the glamour with crimson lips and pencil-thin, painted-on eyebrows - adding drama with an oversized pearl necklace and earrings.

Next up is the 1940s, when France was blighted by the German occupation during WWII; the segment is split into two strikingly different beauty looks: ultra-made up for the occupied northern zone, and a more natural look with victory rolls for the 'free' south.

The 1960s was a time of extravagance, and Corina gets a big beehive and plenty of waves to show this

The 1960s was marked by the hippy movement and Corina's make-up and hair is the perfect fit

Pale lipstick adds to the sultriness of the 1960s and its new found freedoms across France

The 1950s calls for a more neutral approach with Corina sporting pink lips and rosy cheeks, while her 1960s look is unmistakably Brigitte Bardot-inspired, with an oversized beehive barnet and pale lipstick.

The model's 1970s look is a riot of dark lips, smoky eyes and voluminous waves, while the following decade is a much more natural look.

On to disco 1970s, with a sleeker hair style and a rebirth of some bold lip colours, seen here matched with dark eyes

Corina peers over the top of brilliant blue 1970s shades, which are a trademark design of the era

Corina dons kohl eyes, lipliner and a heart-shaped choker for her 1990s look, with an ultra-choppy crop forming the basis of her millennial look.

As we move into the 2010s the model is given a classic look with red lips and a subtle slick of brown eyeshadow, teamed with thick, natural brows.

In the 1980s, Corina wears minimal make-up and an easy, everyday plait that airs to the more practical side of beauty

Time to party in the 1990s, where hair came down but stayed straight and natural, and there wasn't a huge amount more make-up

The dark lip takes centre stage and Corina accessorises with a heart shaped pendant on a choker

Ready to bring in the new millenium, Corina gets the chop with the addition of a fringe and choppy layers

Her layers are twisted into light waves, a nod to the boho looks that dominated the festival scenes

Corina did find out that layers can be a problem though, as she blows one piece of hair out of her face

The last look is the modern day, where Corina has long locks and a bold choice in make-up, taking it right back to the 1910s and 1920s
