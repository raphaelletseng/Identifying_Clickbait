Rockets rookie shows off his unconventional underhanded free-throw form in an NBA game for the first time


Houston Rockets rookie Chinanu Onuaku debuted his underhand free-throw style in an actual regular-season NBA game on Monday night, nailing each of two attempts in convincing fashion during garbage time of a 131-115 victory over the Phoenix Suns.

Onuaku played in college at Louisville, where he switched to the underhand style after shooting 46.7% in more conventional fashion during his freshman season. It worked decently well; in his sophomore year, he shot 58.9% from the line.

With the Rockets, Onuaku used his underhand technique during a preseason trip to China. The underhand method, though not new to the league, hasn't been a regular occurrence since Rick Berry shot that way in the late 1970s. With Onuaku's early success, it might become an option for more of today's players.
