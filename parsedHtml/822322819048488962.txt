America And Russia Are Once Again At Loggerheads And That's A Real Threat To Global Security
America And Russia Are Once Again At Loggerheads And That's A Real Threat To Global Security America’s 2016 Presidential election that led business tycoon, Donald Trump to victory has once again, more than 20 years after the end of the cold war, put Russia and America at loggerheads. In October, outgoing President Barack Obama’s administration publicly said that it was “confident” that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and leaked thousands of emails, many of which included damaging revelations about the Democrats and party nominee, Hilary Clinton. Since then, the two countries have been passing vitriolic remarks at one another, and threatening global security by acting like two kids pushing each other in a sandpit. On December 30, the Obama government expelled 35 Russian diplomats from America saying they were actually intelligence operatives. This move has largely been viewed as America’s way of taking revenge on Russia for hacking their election. Moscow replied to the expulsion by calling the American government “losers” and threatened retaliation. Russia’s response to the event was swift and bitter. The Russian Embassy in London posted a tweet with a picture a duck with the word, “lame” running across the image. The tweet also read, “Cold war déjà vu”.

Obama has also blamed Russia’s alliance with the Assad regime and its broader interference in Syria for the monstrosity and large-scale loss of lives in Aleppo. He said, “"This blood and these atrocities are on their hands.”
