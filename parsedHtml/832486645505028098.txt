Christchurch fire halted as residents count losses

Posted

Firefighters in New Zealand's second-largest city Christchurch have halted the advance of a massive bushfire that destroyed 11 homes and forced more than 1,000 people to evacuate.

Key points: Worst of massive Christchurch fire appears to be over

Residents allowed back on highly restricted basis to retrieve pets and possessions

State of emergency remains but officials plan to let the rest of the fires burn out

The temperature in the city has dropped and it appears the worst of the blaze, which has engulfed thousands of hectares, is over.

Resident Miranda Newbury thought her property was one of those destroyed after authorities incorrectly identified her house as one of those lost.

"We were at our lowest yesterday. And we had to go and tell our kids," she said.

"We didn't because we thought, we haven't seen it yet, and then this morning here it is in the paper, surrounded unfortunately by all our neighbour's properties and ours is one of the few standing."

Like many other residents, the Newburys are apprehensive to go back and try and find their pets.

Some local residents have been allowed back into safe areas that have already burnt out to pick up pets and possessions on a highly restricted basis.

Fifteen helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and more than 200 firefighters were deployed to battle the blaze, which was described by one official as the largest scale fire he had seen in New Zealand.

One helicopter pilot died in a fatal crash while fighting the blazes on Tuesday.

Although a state of emergency has been declared, officials say the plan is to let the fire burn itself out.

The cause of the fire is still unknown.
