Major League Baseball suspended Cincinnati Reds pitching prospect Ian Kahaloa for 50 games after he tested positive for a drug of abuse.

"We're obviously really concerned," said Jeff Graupe, the Reds' player development director, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer's Zach Buchanan. "We're working to get Ian the help and assistance that we believe he needs to get his long-term future to a more stable place. We're kind of putting the baseball on the backburner."

Buchanan reported videos surfaced on social media in March that appeared to show Kahaloa using an illicit substance. Kahaloa had shared the videos on Snapchat, and Twitter user @Reds_1fan shared them online. (Warning: Tweet below contains NSFW images):

In another Snapchat video from Kahaloa's account, a bong and what appears to be marijuana is shown.

Kahaloa's agent, Dave Matranga, told Buchanan he couldn't confirm whether his client was the person in the videos, but Graupe said he and the team believe the man to be Kahaloa "to the best of our understanding."

Matranga said the 19-year-old right-hander is in drug rehab and "committed to doing whatever the Cincinnati Reds need him to do."

Kahaloa spent the 2016 season with Cincinnati's two Rookie League affiliates. In 12 appearances, he went 3-2 with a 2.39 ERA. In January, Baseball Prospectus ranked him as the Reds' 10th-best prospect.
