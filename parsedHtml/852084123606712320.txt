Drop the Target: Theresa May must drop the tens of thousands net migration cap – sign our petition now
Open Britain and are campaigning for the Government to drop their target to reduce net migration to the “tens of thousands”. If ever met, this would deny our country of skills and talent on which our economy relies. With Article 50 triggered and Brexit under way, Britain now more than ever needs to attract hard-working, bright, talented people from all over the world to support our economy and public services. Keeping the current migration target would be economically damaging and potentially socially divisive, as it is based on the premise that migrants are a negative for our country when they are in fact the opposite, as centuries of experience demonstrate. The UK must always be an open and vibrant nation. More about: Drop the Target Migration Immigration Theresa May Comments
