A Texas elector pitched Kasich instead of Trump to electors in a New York Times op-ed published Monday

Washington (CNN) Ohio Gov. John Kasich doesn't want to take Donald Trump's place as President-elect of the United States.

The former Republican presidential candidate, who ran against Trump in the primary, tweeted Tuesday asking that electors in the Electoral College not cast their votes for him when they meet December 19.

Kasich tweeted a statement that said, "I am not a candidate for president and ask that electors not vote for me when they gather later this month. Our country had an election and Donald Trump won. The country is divided and there are certainly raw emotions on both sides stemming from the election. But this approach, as well meaning as it is, will only serve to further divide our nation, when unity is what we need."
