18C: Proposed changes to Racial Discrimination Act defeated in Senate

Posted

The Senate has defeated the Government's attempt to change the wording of the Racial Discrimination Act.

The Government had wanted to replace the words "insult, offend and humiliate" with "harass".

But after hours of debate, Labor, the Greens and some of the crossbench voted against it.

More to come.
