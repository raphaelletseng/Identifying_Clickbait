Poland's prime minister is staying in hospital for several days after having a car crash


Poland's Prime Minister Beata Szydlo is recovering quickly from last week's car crash, but she will remain in hospital for the next several days, the government's spokesman said on Monday.

Szydlo was hurt whenÂ a car crashed into her government convoy in Oswiecim, near Krakow, and herÂ car struck a tree in a crash on Friday. She was subsequently flown to a hospital in Warsaw.

Very few details about her condition have been made public but, at the time, media outlets, such as The Independent, reported she only suffered from some "bruising" and was taken to hospital only for "routine tests."Â

This was a picture from the scene:

The government's spokesman, Rafal Bochenek, read a doctors' statement saying her injuries have not required any surgeries.

"The nature of the injuries and the progress in treatment and rehabilitation promise a quick recovery," Bochenek said.

Szydlo will skip Tuesday's scheduled government meeting and will remain "for observation" for the next several days.
