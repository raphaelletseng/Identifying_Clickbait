President Trump signs executive actions advancing Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines


President Donald Trump signed a number of executive actions on Tuesday aimed at advancing construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, subject to "renegotiation" by the administration.

"We'll see if we can get the [pipelines] built," Trump said, adding that they would create "great construction jobs."Â

Trump also signed executive actions detailing that pipelines should be built in the United States. "We'll put a lot of workers back to work," the president said.

Trump additionally signed an executive order aimed at reducing the "cumbersome" regulationsÂ on the oil industry in order to promote domestic manufacturing. "The regulatory process in this country has become a tangled up mess and very unfair to people," Trump said while signing the executive action.Â

Bloomberg first reported the president's plans to sign the executive actions today, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Former president Barack Obama rejected Transcanada Corp's Keystone XL oil pipeline in November 2015 after environmentalists campaigned against the project for more than seven years.

Energy Transfer Partners' $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline has also faced opposition.

Activists have spent months protesting plans to route the pipeline beneath a lake near a North Dakota Indian reservation, saying the project poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites.
