Prom is a rite of passage for most teenagers.

Often the biggest night of the year, where they dress up and celebrate with their friends.

17-year-old Paula Goodgame from St. Petersburg, Florida had been busy preparing for one of the biggest nights of her high school career - until she got some bad news on Wednesday.

After receiving an email from her school guidance counsellor, Paula discovered she wouldn't be able to take Anjali Persad - her girlfriend of four months - to the prom, because the school has a policy against dates of the same sex.

The Catholic school's official prom guidelines state that "escorts must be of the opposite gender" but as a new student, Paula was unaware of the rule.

The school requires all guests bringing dates that aren't students at Saint Petersburg Catholic School to fill out a "Prom Guest Request Form".

Paula's girlfriend, Anjali, is a student at a nearby private school.

Since tweeting a screenshot of the email, Paula has had floods of support from the LGBTQ community on Twitter.

People have also been emailing the school Principal, Bruno Fernandez, objecting to the ""unfair", "ridiculous", and "offensive" policy.

Speaking to Buzzfeed, Paula said:
