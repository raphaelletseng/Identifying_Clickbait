LONDON â€” It's that time of year again.

Everyone knows that trousers (or pants, if you're America) are a cumbersome, abrasive burden, so it's only right that one day a year we get to dispense with them altogether for our daily commute.

No Trousers Tube Ride Day is a glorious tradition started in New York back in 2002, which quickly spread to other countries when people realised just how much fun not wearing trousers on public transport can be.

Here are some highlights from the London's 2017 'No Trousers Tube Ride':
