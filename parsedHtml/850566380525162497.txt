Lee Foss' first full length solo album Alchemy has now seen the light of day.

We'll forgive him for the wait -- theÂ Chicago DJ/producer has plenty on his plate with newly launched label Repopulate Mars,Â not to mention his Hot Creations and Emerald CityÂ imprints with Hot Natured co-conspirator Jamie Jones.

"Deep Congo" opens the outing with a muscularÂ bass line and shimmering synthesizers, and the feel-good ride rarely relents from there. Other highlights include the disco-tingedÂ "Living in the City" with LeeÂ CurtissÂ andÂ "Blue is the Distance," which finds Foss reuniting with Hot Natured collaborators Anabel EnglundÂ and Ali Love.
