The first half of Wednesday's much-anticipated encounter between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena ended with a bit of controversy involving MVP candidate Russell Westbrook and Golden State's Zaza Pachulia . In the final seconds of the second quarter, Pachulia drilled Westbrook high with a hard foul. If that weren't bad enough, the Warriors center hit the OKC guard in the face with a downward slap. Westbrook fell to the court, but Pachulia apparently felt no remorse over his actions. In fact, the 6'11" big man stood over his victim and stared at him, almost as if he believed Westbrook had flopped. The referees didn't agree, however, as they gave Pachulia a flagrant-1. After the game, Pachulia gave his thoughts on the play: Westbrook on the Pachulia incident: "I'm gonna get his ass back for that one." https://t.co/yJDYes2nXn Zaza Pachulia on the Westbrook play: "If it was a hard foul, it was a hard foul. It wasn't dirty at all." Regardless of whether it was dirty, Westbrook vowed revenge: Zaza Pachulia on the foul on Westbrook: "You just move on, if he got hurt, that's fine too, it's part of the game." The two teams will meet in Oklahoma City on Feb. 11. [Twitter] Like the new article format? Send us feedback ! Where can I comment?
