The Department Of Education Misspells Apology For Misspelling W.E.B. Du Bois' Name
The Department Of Education Can't Spell W.E.B. Du Bois' Name
Maybe the Department of Education should have double-checked the spelling of W.E.B. Du Bois‚Äô name with Frederick Douglass before tweeting about him. In a tweet that went out Sunday morning, the agency attributed a quote from famous civil rights activist Du Bois to ‚ÄúW.E.B. DeBois.‚Äù Education must not simply teach work - it must teach life. ‚Äì W.E.B. DeBois pic.twitter.com/Re4cWkPSFA The internet was quick to point out how horrifying it is that the Department of Education ‚Äï now run by Betsy DeVos, an education activist who critics fear could dismantle the public education system ‚Äï would misspell the name of a civil rights leader, especially during Black History Month. The NAACP clapped back with an apt Du Bois quote, while others roasted the department for its carelessness.
