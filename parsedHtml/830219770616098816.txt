Everyone's Freaking Out About Cyrus Beene On This Week's "Scandal"
The Feb. 9 episode of was CRAZY, as usual. We finally got some insight into the details of Frankie Vargas‚Äôs death, and unsurprisingly, Cyrus Beene seemed to be at the center of it all. Fitz opened an investigation into the murder of Vargas because of footage Olivia Pope & Associates found in which the late president-elect and Cyrus were fighting. In flashbacks, we saw Cyrus ask Tom to ‚Äútake care‚Äù of a woman who worked on the campaign and who he thought was having an affair with Vargas. It turned out she wasn‚Äôt actually sleeping with the candidate, but not before Tom attacked her. Apparently, that wasn‚Äôt all the two of them were up to: In addition to being romantically involved, Tom asked Cyrus if he wanted him to help make him the president, implying Tom would kill Vargas. And Cyrus agreed. There were some super intense moments in the episode, eventually ending with Cyrus heading to jail because Tom confessed to the murder of Frankie Vargas under Cyrus‚Äôs orders. That also meant that Mellie became the president-elect (at least until next week). People were shocked, to say the least. The last 5 minutes of #Scandal got me like @shondarhimes @kerrywashington
