‘10 Concerts’ Facebook Meme May Reveal More Than Musical Tastes
‘10 Concerts’ Facebook Meme May Reveal More Than Musical Tastes
It’s all fun and games until someone’s password security question gets hacked. A meme making the rounds on Facebook asks users to list 10 concerts — nine they’ve attended and a fabricated one — and invites others to identify the fake one. But the post — “10 Concerts I’ve Been To, One is a Lie” — might also be an invitation to a midlevel threat to your online privacy and security, experts said. The meme, which surged in popularity this week, is the kind of frivolous distraction that makes up social media interactions, similar to other viral memes, such as the Ice Bucket Challenge. Privacy experts cautioned it could reveal too much about a person’s background and preferences and sounds like a security question — name the first concert you attended — that you might be asked on a banking, brokerage or similar website to verify your identity. Advertisement Michael Kaiser , executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance , said on Friday that the meme posed a moderate security risk, adding that not every website relied on a security question about a person’s first concert. Advertisement He said the greater danger is what such a list might broadly reveal through social engineering . It could telegraph information about a user’s age, musical tastes and even religious affiliation — all of which would be desirable to marketers hoping to target ads. He said it is similar to users who take quizzes on Facebook. The answers can reveal specifics about a person’s upbringing, culture or other identifying details. “You are expressing things about you, maybe in more subtle ways than you might think,” he said. Mark Testoni, a national security and privacy expert who is chief executive of SAP National Security Services , said in an email that he recommended exercising “vigilance bordering on a little paranoia” in online posts.
