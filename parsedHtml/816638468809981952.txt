Nick Young Explains His Recent Hot Shooting: "It's the Draco Soulja Effect"
How glad is everyone that the Lakers decided to trade Nick Young in the offseason? He very well could be playing in, like, Milwaukee or Orlando right now and fighting for minutes on a mediocre team, but instead, he’s currently helping lead a Lakers team that is, if nothing else, fun to watch. After a tough 2015-16 NBA season both on and off the court, Swaggy P is once again, well, Swaggy P. The Lakers knocked off the Grizzlies on Tuesday night, and it was due in large part to Swaggy’s hot shooting performance. He knocked down six of the 11 three-pointers he took and finished with 20 points in 27 minutes. He also celebrated one of those threes with one of the best celebrations you’ll see all season: Nick Young living up to his nickname 😂 https://t.co/j2unzXaXUe And after the game, Young was asked about why he has been able to shoot the ball so well lately. He started off by giving a cliché answer about how the Lakers shared the ball and "played as a team," which is what you would expect 99 percent of the other NBA players out there to say. But then, Young suddenly switched gears and gave a much different response to explain his hot streak. Nick Young credits his recent hot shooting streak to "That Draco Soulja Effect" 💀 pic.twitter.com/1BNwNReCeE "It’s the Draco Soulja Effect," he said, "and we just playing some ball and having fun and enjoying the game." What an answer. Everyone loved it: Nick Young said it's the "DRACO Soulja effect" for the 3 ball success 😂😂 lmao Nick Young just said his great shooting is a product of the Draco Soulja Effect Reporter asked Nick young why he was shooting so well and he said "it's the Soulja Draco effect" ☠️☠️☠️ Keep shooting, Swaggy.
