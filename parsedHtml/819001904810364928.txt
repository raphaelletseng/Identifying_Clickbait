On Monday’s The Late Late Show, TV, film, and Broadway star Neil Patrick Harris had some Broadway beef to settle with James Corden. It was an intense battle, as both Harris and Corden have won Tony Awards — though Harris pointed out that Corden’s was for a “nonsinging” role.

The two traded turns singing Broadway classics like “Sit Down, You’re Rockin’ the Boat” from Guys and Dolls and “Everything’s Coming Up Roses” from Gypsy: A Musical Fable.

Things heated up as Corden sang “All That Jazz” from Chicago and Harris reprised “Sugar Daddy” from his role in Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

Thankfully, they were able to squash their beef and come together to perform “My Shot” from Hamilton.

The Late Late Show With James Corden airs weeknights at 12:37 a.m. on CBS.
