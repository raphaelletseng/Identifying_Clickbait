In some of the more gruesome footage the soldiers can also be seen shooting targets at close range before going in to inspect the rebel's corpses.

The presenter of the weekly news show that broadcast the footage said it was filmed in Syria but would not give any more details on the exact location.

Russia first acknowledged the presence of its special forces in Syria during the recapture of the city of Palmyra from ISIS in March.

But so far it has provided no information on the number of deployed or their exact location.

However, it was reported today that ISIS has recaptured territory close to Palmyra and that a suspected gas attack had been carried out.

Citing local sources near the site of the attack in eastern Hama province, the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights said there were cases of suffocation and that 52 people had been killed.

The reported attack came from the air and took place near the town of Uqairabat, which lies on a main road leading south into Palmyra from government-held territory, the Observatory said, without specifying who might have been responsible.

Amaq, a news service linked to ISIS, said in an online statement that 20 people had died and around 200 were injured from breathing problems 'as a result of a Russian air attack with sarin gas'.

But both the Syrian army and Russia have denied using chemical weapons.

On Sunday, Islamic State militants recaptured Palmyra despite dozens of Russian air strikes attempting to push them back. It had previously been driven from the city in March.

Meanwhile, the EU has no plans to impose sanctions on Russia over the conflict in Syria, foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Monday ahead of a leaders' summit this week.

'No, we didn't discuss at all sanctions, and there was no member state asking for additional work on sanctions' against Russia, Mogherini said after a meeting of European Union foreign ministers.

EU leaders backed down from threatening sanctions on Moscow over the carnage in Aleppo at their last summit in October amid deep divisions in the bloc about how tough to be on Russia.
