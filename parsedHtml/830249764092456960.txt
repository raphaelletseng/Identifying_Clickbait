Officer and pup partner enforce the law and look good doing it
What a good boy! Levi Knach, a law enforcement officer with Indiana's Department of Natural Resources, took a portrait with his partner — which normally wouldn't be too exciting. But his partner happens to be one adorable pup. In a series of photos posted to the department's Facebook page , Kenobi broke the character of a tough police dog and showed his handler some much appreciated puppy love. Image:  @INdnrlawenforcement The pair eventually got a serious shot but it's nice to see their playful side. The Facebook post went on to describe the duo as "awesome" and how they make a great team while they hit the streets. I guess working together isn't so ruff.
