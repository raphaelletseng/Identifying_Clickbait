2. Investors and US tech industry leaders like 500 Startups' Dave McClure, investor Ron Conway, and Hyperloop One founder Shervin Pishevar have signed a letter saying the immigration ban will cause "irreversible harm".Â They also criticised proposed changes to the H-1B visa.

4.Â Silicon Valley employees are planning an anti-Trump protest on March 14, also known as Pi Day (3/14 or 3.14). Up to 1,000 attendees are expected to take part at Palo Alto City Hall.

5. Facebook is particularlyÂ vulnerable to any changes to the H-1B visa, according to itsÂ US Labor Department filings. More than 15% of its US employees hold a temporary work visa, meaning Facebook is classified as "dependent" on the H-1B.
