After Padmavati, Badrinath Ki Dulhania Faces Trouble Over Its Title By A Hindu Group!
After Padmavati, Badrinath Ki Dulhania Faces Trouble Over Its Title By A Hindu Group! Making films today isn't cakewalk. Apart from all the hard work that goes into making a film, the increase in intolerance in our country is another reason why making a film has become a mission. Some groups of our country are over-sensitive and sometimes its the movie's title or the entire story that ends up irking them. After the attack on Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the film fraternity showed unity and stood up for the director after he was targeted and attacked by a religious group in Jaipur. And now, another film has hit troubled waters, claims a report.

The letter demands that filmmakers change the name to ‚ÄòBadri‚Äô from ‚ÄòBadrinath‚Äô.
