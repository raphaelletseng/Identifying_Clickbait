Hilarious photos capture petty acts of revenge around the worldÂ 


It's a well-known adage: revenge is a dish best served cold.

Which is certainly the case with some of these elaborate payback stunts.

In vengeful acts from around the world rounded up by MailOnline Travel, some of these people have put an awful lot of time and dedication into their punishments.

One American woman took out an entire billboard to advertise a special message for her cheating husband - 'I know all about her, you dirty, sneaky, immoral, unfaithful, poorly-endowed slimeball' - which she gleefully paid for using their joint account.

Elsewhere, a man's son dealt his blow by opening just the tip of every banana in the house.

Other examples include people who have eked out their revenge on inconsiderate parking by boxing cars in with bins and trolleys, and a roommate pursuing a serious vendetta.
