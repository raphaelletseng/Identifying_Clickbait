“Earlier, I used to get upset with the way these remixes were done. They took away the essence and soul of the original songs. Gaane vidhwansak ho gaye hain (songs have a destructive tone nowadays). But now, I realise that this is how the newer generation expresses love. I wonder how they still appreciate Sufi music, which is so soulful,” she told Mid-day.
