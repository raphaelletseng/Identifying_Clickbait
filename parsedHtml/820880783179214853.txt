Honda Said to See 2017 Global Sales Rising on China, U.S. Demand
Honda Motor Co. is projecting an increase in global sales in the fiscal year starting April on demand in the U.S. and China, according to a person familiar with the automaker’s plans. The Tokyo-based company has informed suppliers of its target to sell 5.15 million cars in the 2017 fiscal year, rising from 4.98 million units projected for the 12 months ending March 31, said the person, who asked not to be named as the information is private. The target could be revised as it announces its annual earnings forecast around May, the person said. Honda declined to comment on the sales plan. Honda sold a record number vehicles in the U.S. and China last year, helped by demand for its Vezel crossover and the new Civic sedan. The carmaker is banking on new models including its popular CR-V to drive sales this year. The Nikkei newspaper first reported the target on Monday.
