Northern Gas Pipeline contractor axed, Jemena to re-tender for partner

Updated

The company developing the $800 million gas pipeline that would link Tennant Creek and Mt Isa has terminated its construction deal three weeks after announcing delays resulting from land access problems.

A spokesman for Jemena said the company had "reviewed arrangements" with contractor McConnell Dowell and determined they "will not meet the needs of the project" that was originally set to start construction in April.

"This means Jemena will shortly look to appoint construction partners through a competitive tender process," the spokesman said.

McConnell Dowell was contracted to build the 622-kilometre Northern Gas Pipeline as well as two compressor stations and gas treatment facilities.

Construction was originally set to begin in April.

Earlier this month Jemena said it was "resequencing" its construction timetable because it had not secured land access agreements from traditional owners, who said they were worried the pipeline would lead to fracking operations.

The Jemena spokesman said the delay was a factor in the decision to end the arrangement with McConnell Dowell.

But he said neither the land access issues nor the contract change would delay completion of the project, which is slated for 2018.

The Northern Gas Pipeline is intended to carry excess gas purchased by the Northern Territory's Power and Water Corporation from the offshore Blacktip field and on-sold to a manufacturing operation in Mt Isa.

It has been touted as a major opportunity to connect the Northern Territory's gas resources to the east coast market.
