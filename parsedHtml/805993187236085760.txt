Michael Bay is back for more robots-in-disguise action with the fifth installment in the toy-based movie franchise, which is set to barrel into theaters on June 23. The film’s first trailer is expected to drop later on Monday, and we’ve got a host of new photos from the film, which is likely to be a blockbuster and promises to deliver considerable star power from the likes of Mark Wahlberg, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Stanley Tucci and Sir Anthony Hopkins, as well as the same brand of movie mayhem that has defined the series.
