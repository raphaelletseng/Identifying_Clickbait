Berlin market attack: Tunisian man released after German authorities find no link to suspect

Updated

German authorities have released a Tunisian man detained on suspicion of involvement in the truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market last week that killed 12 people, a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office says.

"Further investigation has shown that the arrested person was not the possible contact person of Anis Amri and therefore he was released," Frauke Koehler said, referring to the man believed to have hijacked the truck and ploughed it into crowds at a Christmas market.

Twelve people were killed and nearly 50 others injured when the truck drove into the popular market filled with tourists and locals outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church near Berlin's Zoo station.

After the attack, Amri fled to Italy where he was shot dead by police after he pulled a gun on them during a routine check in the early hours of last Friday.

Investigators found the mobile phone number of the released 40-year-old Tunisian stored in the phone of Amri.

The spokeswoman said that a gun Amri used in the truck had the same calibre as the one he fired at Italian police in Milan, where he was shot dead last week.

More tests were needed to determine whether it was the same gun, she said.

The spokeswoman added that the truck's automatic breaking system stopped the vehicle 70 to 80 metres after it hit the market, avoiding more casualties.
