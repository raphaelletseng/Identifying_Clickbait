INTERVIEWS

Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy. TMZ, Jan. 2 • This is a gospel album with a whole lot of cursing on it, but it’s still a gospel album. It’s the gospel, according to ’Ye. Big Boy’s Neighborhood, Feb. 4 • Robert Kardashian’s still doing deals for controversial black people from up in heaven. Big Boy’s Neighborhood, Feb. 4. • I want the best for that person [Taylor Swift], but there’s people going through real issues out here. Us Weekly, Feb. 19 • If you like my music, listen to it. If you like her music, listen to it. Us Weekly, Feb. 19 • I’m an arrogant hypocrite? You’re gonna make money on that photo, though, right? to a TMZ photographer, March 5 • I don’t wanna have to be doing “Goldigger” when I’m 50 years old. I wanna be doing it for fun... I know I got rich people problems -- that’ s the only problems I wanna have. Big Boy’s Neighborhood, June 3 • Maybe in some alternative universe me and George Bush could have been friends. I could have been his O.J. Simpson-black friend on the golf course. Vanity Fair, June 24 • [I say] a lot of lines other wives would not allow a husband to say. But my wife also puts up photos that other husbands wouldn’t let them put up. One of the keys to happiness in our marriage is we’re allowed to be ourselves. Vanity Fair, June 24 • Matthew Barney is my Jesus. Vanity Fair, June 24

I actually don’t like thinking. I think people think I like to think a lot. And I don’t. I do not like to think at all. Harper’s Bazaar, July 28 • I love sleep; it’s my favorite. Harper’s Bazaar, July 28 • I just love seeing her naked; I love nudity... I think it’s important for Kim to have her figure. To not show it would be like Adele not singing.

When I talk about the idea of being president, I’m not saying I have any political views. I don’t have views on politics, I just have a view on humanity, on people, on the truth. Annie Mac interview, July 30 • I have to work with IKEA. Annie Mac interview, July 30 • People call you crazy so much you start to believe it. Annie Mac interview, July 30 • I’m really not here for controversy. Vogue, Sept. 7 • I was just saying the wrong things out loud. I [now] try to start with ‘why.’ Why am I saying this? Vogue, Sept. 7 • I’m the elf that’s Will Ferrell, that’s too big for his hands to make the toys. W interview, Sept. 15 • My definition of success is dropping a Charlie Sheen-level tweet and being like, ‘I am in debt and f— you.’ W interview, Sept. • More people need to know that they’re not f—ing cool. In today’s world, having money has allowed people who are extremely uncool to think that they’re cool. People who really are cool have to literally turn in their cool card to society just to make it past the age of 28. It’s either die at 28 or turn in your cool pass... I will be a part of this because I don’t want to miss out. I don’t wanna be dead when the world starts getting good. Surface magazine, Nov. 20

But my fact is that there are people who voted for Trump here at the show... Celebrities are our influencers now. Just look at our president, he wasn’t in politics and he won. Saint Pablo Tour, Los Angeles, Nov. 18 • A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost. You know why? Because y’all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you... I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, f— you. Yeah, I’m taking his lead... Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this (screams) and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro... BeyoncÃ©, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over “Hotline Bling”... F— looking cool. F— being cool. F— all that, bruh!...

Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack. The Saint Pablo Tour is more relevant than radio and if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton... I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel... Get ready to have a field day, press. Get ready, get ready. Because the show’s over. (Drops mic.)
