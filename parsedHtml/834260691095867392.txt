These Photos Posted By People Of Color In Love Make A Beautiful Point
A powerful hashtag is here to remind us that love is diverse and beautiful. Last year, the Twitter account @BeautyInColor created the hashtag #POCInLove to bring visibility to relationships between people of color. Last week, the 23-year-old behind the account revived the hashtag for Valentine’s Day. The photos tweeted by couples so far are unbelievably sweet: korean & black , filipino & chippewa native. bestfriends for 7 yrs, engaged, and a baby girl on the way ✨ #POCinLove  pic.twitter.com/WJ7lmynCX2 Really, could these two be any cuter? #POCinlove bcos honestly have u ever seen a man so fine who knows so much about numbers and economics and stuff? 🇲🇺 pic.twitter.com/K79nPoGdPZ Some tweets are poetry-filled: i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart) i am never without it (anywhere i go, you go) i fear no fate (for you are my fate) #POCinlove  pic.twitter.com/oWUjpdTMdI Other people talk about how they had to cross a cultural divide to be together: He's an Arab Muslim. I'm a black girl from Compton. They said it wouldn't work...almost 4 years later, still blissfully in love. #PoCinLove  pic.twitter.com/DohdsjqDlB The woman behind the hashtag told The Huffington Post that she created the hashtag as a response to the lack of couples of color and LGBT couples portrayed in movies and TV. “It’s important all types of love are celebrated,” she said. “Relationships are hard as it is but it’s even harder when you’re dealing with racism, homophobia or your families not accepting your partner.” With this hashtag, “it’s just nice for people to show off the person they’re with and possibly had to fight to be with.” See more of the adorable couples below:   Long distance doesn't stop my love for him 💕 #PoCInlove  pic.twitter.com/JYMBNldiyP     I love your brown skin, your passion for social justice, and your chicano roots. te amo. #Pocinlove  pic.twitter.com/KRNUItre1Z     We’ve Fallen For This Viral Celebration of Multiethnic Relationships #PoCInLove  https://t.co/bs9g0lEdp3  pic.twitter.com/4NxCcFuTzz     never gonna pass on an opportunity to show off our relationship bc we've been through shit for being together 💖 filipino-indian #POCinlove  pic.twitter.com/HujMCRsYZd     Two queers, unlimited snapchat filters.
