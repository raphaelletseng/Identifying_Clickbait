Those who are sceptical about the supernatural may just have their opinion swayed by these spine-tingling tales of the unexplained.

It wasn't long before fellow users came forward with chilling tales guaranteed to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.

Ghostly tales of the unexplained featured heavily on the new thread on Reddit

What is most unsettling about these tales is that they're all from users who claim to be telling the truth - the thread is marked with a 'Serious' tag to discourage joke responses.

For many people their scariest story involved an inexplicable supernatural experience.

One admission revealed that a group of friends were left startled by an unexplained voice while inside an abandoned hospital

During a drive back to his house this man hadn't expected to bump into anyone let alone what he did see.

While many of the unsettling tales recounted terrifying paranormal experiences, others revealed equally disturbing instances with no ghosts involved.

One user revealed two stories with the second one recalling a man's strange behaviour proving particuarly harrowing.

A man who used to work in a care home revealed that he was left shaken by the actions of one of the elderly women in his care.
