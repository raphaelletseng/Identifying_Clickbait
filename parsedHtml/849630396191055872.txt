Flying Mattress Strikes Biker At 50 MPH, Cushions His Fall
A motorbike rider somehow avoided serious injury after a flying mattress struck him on a highway. Aaron Wood was riding through the Clem7 tunnel in Brisbane, Australia, last Tuesday when the bedding fell from a pickup truck’s cage trailer and into his path. Incredibly, the squishy mattress got trapped under his front wheel and helped bring his motorbike to a stop ― without him falling onto the ground. Queensland Police released surveillance footage of the dramatic incident. It enabled them to identify the Toyota’s driver, who now reportedly faces a $275 fine for traveling with an unsecured load.
