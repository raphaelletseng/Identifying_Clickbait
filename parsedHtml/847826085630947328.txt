The body was sent to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital for an autopsy, according to The Daily Star.

Mahmuda Begum, the superintendent of the female hostel, said the model 'always looked happy,' and added, 'it is hard to believe she would commit suicide'.

Ms Begum said: 'I was in my chamber. Suddenly, I heard screams of my students.

'Rushing to the second floor of this six-storey building, I saw some of the students trying to break the door of Athif's room.'

The door was locked from the inside and students broke into the room.

'We primarily suspect it is a suicide case. However, we can't come to any conclusion until we get the autopsy report,' said the officer-in-charge Zillur Rahman.

The model's first major breakthrough was a stunning image taken by photographer Sotti called 'Maldivian Girl With Aqua Blue Eyes,' which was praised by the former president of the Maldives over social media.
