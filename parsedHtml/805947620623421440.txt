A Mum Didn’t Sell Anything At A Craft Fair So Twitter Bought Everything
Martyn Hett is a 28-year-old from Manchester, England. What you can’t see in this photo is that he’s actually son of the year after he saved his mum’s knitting career via Twitter. Get ready: Things are about to get v emotional. Martyn told BuzzFeed that a couple weeks ago he checked in with his mum to see if she was having a nice day. “She came back to me saying that she was feeling a bit sad because nobody was buying her stuff,” he said. My mum has set up her own stall at a craft fair and has messaged me to say she hasn't sold anything yet and my hear… https://t.co/nFhqUoK7tJ Not long after Martyn tweeted the picture of his mum’s stall, a friend bought a glove monster from her Depop page. My heart is melting, thank you @LiamLambrini for being her first customer One purchase turned into three. Omg guys please continue to buy things, THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY. Her shop is here: https://t.co/wjSvW7sxVQ Three turned into nine. What a beautiful end to this story 😭😭😭 I'm weeping. KEEP THE DREAM ALIVE HERE >> https://t.co/wjSvW7aX4i Excuse me, I need to go in search of tissue to dry my tears. And soon enough, because Twitter is great, word quickly spread and left Martyn’s mum, Figen, with a lot of work to do to keep up with demands. Met up with me mam for the first time since her viral fame. She's stocked up on materials and has had a very busy w… https://t.co/JAqo3d12Wg “She sews/knits for therapeutic reasons,” said Martyn. “She’s a counsellor and she believes that being creative is good for the soul – it’s advice she often gives to her clients. Since it went viral, she’s decided to donate money from her earnings to a local charity, Beacon Counselling .” People have obviously been heading to Figen’s Depop page to buy everything. Thank you so much @FigenMurray for Flora, I promise to take so much care of her 💞 And since the story has gone global, requests have been coming in from far and wide. She's going global! 🌎 The reactions have been great. @martynhett my teddy has just arrived ! It's beyond adorable !! 🐻 Since becoming a viral hit, Figen has even bought a book to help her connect with her fanbase on Twitter . Omg she's bought this book to help her cope with her new followers/fanbase on twitter 😂😂 I just love her “I’ve found the whole thing rather hilarious,” Martyn said. “I popped over at the weekend to have lunch with her and she’d restocked her materials.” “She’s had loads of messages from people just telling her how nice her stuff is, which was nice for her because I think the craft fair had knocked her confidence a bit.” If you fancy logging onto Figen’s Depop page to buy something, you might have some trouble because it’s SOLD OUT. But don’t be alarmed – Figen will be updating her page ASAP. Sufficiently cried out now?
