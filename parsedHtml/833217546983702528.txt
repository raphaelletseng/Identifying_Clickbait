Sending work emails is a tricky business.

Automatic exclamation marks, smilies, LOLs and terms of endearment are all at hand to give your emails a little more oomph.

The Emotional Labor extension lightens up emails sent through Gmail and can be installed in Chrome.

Click on the smiley face after composing an email and the extension will change the tone of the email before sending.

Serious words become playful and full stops become a series of exclamation marks.

It also adds cheery introductory text: 'Thanks for getting in touch', becomes; Hey lovely! I've been thinking of you :) Thanks for getting in touch!!!'

The sign-off changes from 'All the best' to 'All the xoxo'.

'It is hard to communicate in words. It is work. What was once the concern of professional writers is now a burden we all share, as we communicate all day long over email and texts', said creator Joanne McNeil, a New York based writer, in a post on Medium.

'When I attempt to display an emotion I don't actually feel over email, I fret over sounding insincere or abrupt or otherwise upsetting someone unintentionally', said Ms McNeil.

Ms McNeil, who is a writer and technology expert, admitted that the project is largely satire as opposed to a genuinely useful service.

'I was inspired to create the extension after many futile attempts to start using canned responses,' she said.

'The Emotional Labor email extension looks fake. That's the point. I wanted to reveal my exhaustion, my fatigue in needing to attend to so much correspondence', she said.

'Perhaps it may be of some use!!!! Or, at the very least, I hope you find it amusing!!!!!' she said.
