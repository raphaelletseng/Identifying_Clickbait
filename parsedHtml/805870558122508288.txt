Mom impresses her son with impromptu car rap
Mom impresses her son with impromptu car rap
Most kids are mortified when parents crank up the car stereo volume and sing their hearts out. Not the case with this mom, though. This really cute mom recorded herself rapping to Da Brat's "Funkdafied" and sent it to her son with a message: "21 Savage who??" He tweeted the clip where it received a slew of comments praising her beat-dropping talent.
