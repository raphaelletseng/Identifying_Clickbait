54 of the most hilariously bad Amazon movie reviews


For the past few years, Joe Grabinksi has chronicled the most hilariously badÂ Amazon reviews of popular movies.

Grabinski's Twitter account, "Amazon Movie Reviews," has amassed almostÂ 200,000 followers, and is a pitch-perfect mixture of extremely misguidedÂ reviews and just plain wacky ones.

We asked Grabinksi to update a list of his favoritesÂ he put together for us last year. These are the best of the bad. The ones he chose range in tone from clueless to angry, to some that we truly hope were meant as a joke. A few things we noticed: Parents tend to blame movies for everything, and at least one person still really cares about VHS.

Get your popcorn ready.
