This Kid Pulled The Most Hilarious Prank In A Cell Phone Store
Imagine walking into a cell phone store and noticing that all of the phones have the same kind of…odd wallpaper choice. Eu não sei vocês mas eu já tenho um novo ídolo para 2017

 (Ps: todos os aparelhos da loja estavam assim) “I don’t know about you guys, but I already found my new role model for 2017.” Camilla, who posted the pics to Twitter, told BuzzFeed Brasil that she was seated, having a coffee, when she saw this boy messing around with the cell phones and giggling. It happened at Saraiva in the Center Norte shopping center in São Paulo. According to Camilla, the boy would go up to the various cell phones displayed around the store, always with the same mischievous look on his face. “I saw him messing around and laughing, I hadn’t seen him making faces,” she said. When Camilla got closer and realized what he had done, she laughed and congratulated the boy on his “work.” Embarrassed, he just giggled and thanked her. Thanks for bringing a little more joy and laughter to our day, both of you!   Tell Us Your Zodiac Sign And We'll Tell You What Alcoholic...
