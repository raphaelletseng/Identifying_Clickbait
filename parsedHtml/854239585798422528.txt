Why We Feel So Squeezed in the Skies
Flying is up while ticket prices are down The number of people who fly has increased at a faster rate than the population over all. This growth is at least partly fueled by increasingly cheaper flights. $500 $473 600 million 400 Total annual domestic U.S. airline passengers $353 300 400 Average domestic U.S. airfare 200 200 100 U.S. population 0 0 ’90 ’16 ’95 ’16 Airfares are for round-trip and one-way tickets.

It’s not just your imagination: Planes today are fuller. Your legs have as much as two inches less space compared with a decade ago, according to Seat Guru. And while the ticket prices have fallen, airlines have recently found ways to make more money from each passenger by charging fees for things that used to be taken for granted, like checked baggage.

Load factor is the annual averages of domestic and international passenger miles as a percentage of available seat miles. Passenger yield is total passenger revenue divided by revenue passenger miles.

Fuller cabins and higher fees equal more complaints

Among the biggest airlines, United and American received the most complaints last year (and for that matter, over the last decade).

Airlines don’t have much incentive to change how we fly

The airline industry has undergone major consolidation in the last decade — Delta and Northwest, United and Continental, Southwest and AirTran, among others. The biggest few airlines now command over three-quarters of the business. These deals can create greater efficiencies for the airlines, and have already led to strong profits, but little incentive to change.
