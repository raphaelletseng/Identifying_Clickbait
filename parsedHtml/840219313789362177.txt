Pittsburgh Penguins Fan Offers Spare Ticket After Homeless Man Asks for Money
While walking to a recent Pittsburgh Penguins game, a fan named Jimmy Mains encountered a homeless man who was asking for money. Mains offered a spare ticket instead. The homeless man, Rob, was said to have had a fantastic time as the Pens beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 5-2. From Mains' Facebook post: We went in and the whole time he couldn't stop smiling. Once we got to our seats it was time for the National Anthem. Rob took off his hat and sang the whole time. Once the puck dropped he cheered the whole game. During intermission we got chicken tenders. At the end of the game he told me that I made his life. Respect. [Facebook, h/t CBS Pittsburgh ] Like the new article format? Send us feedback !
