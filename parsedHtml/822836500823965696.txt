See the Best Moments From the #Trump420 Demonstration, Complete With 4,200 Free Joints
Washington D.C. was alight with protests and demonstrations Friday afternoon—both literally and figuratively. While thousands protested the official swearing-in of President Donald Trump —a ceremony that included a questionably plagiarized speech —a demonstration of another kind took to the streets: one of nonpartisan weed enthusiasts. The D.C. Cannabis Coalition (DCMJ), co-founded in 2013 by Adam Eidinger and Nikolas Schiller, called its event #Trump420, and rolled 4,200 joints (yes, that's 4-2-0-0) to pass out to weed enthusiasts of every political affiliation. DCMJ describes itself as "a community group fighting for equal rights for DC cannabis users, growers, and their families," and used Trump's Inauguration as an opportunity to raise awareness about its initiatives. Weed was legalized in Washington D.C. in 2015 , but Eidinger and Schiller are continuing to fight to destigmatize weed communities and advocate for legalization nationwide. DCMJ invited Complex to come hang with them while they rolled 4,200 joints from their headquarters, as well as on Friday for their official demonstration, which was attended by Trump supporters and protesters alike. Check out the best of the reefer madness below. For more information on DCMJ, head over to their website .
