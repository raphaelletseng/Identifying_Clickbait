I will never be able to repay her for the blessings that she gave me."  A great lady I loved and owe so much to has left us. I will miss her. I will never be able to repay her for the blessings that she gave me.  Gavin MacLeod, who played Murray Slaughter on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," said in a statement: "A line from our theme song was 'Love is all around,' and that's what it was for five days a week for seven years straight on the Mary Tyler Moore set. It was all because of Mary! She was professional; she was extremely creative, with a terrific sense of humor, and a gifted actress. It goes without saying what a wonderful loving and caring person she was to everyone who worked on the show. Mary was America's sweetheart, and she was mine also. I was the luckiest guy in the world just sitting next to her ... Today, 'sadness is all around' for all of us, and I will miss Mary ... deeply."

The picture that we all have of her, that's how she was — sweet, kind, so tender, so delicate. She was America's sweetheart. Valerie and I always had to rehearse and rehearse, to work things through, but Mary was always ready to go, thoroughly prepared. The last time I saw her was our 'Hot in Cleveland' reunion. I had a feeling I wouldn't see her again. If I could see her one last time, I'd hold her in my arms and say, 'We love you.'" Her "Flirting With Disaster" co-star Ben Stiller wrote, "I loved Mary Tyler Moore on so many levels it was confusing. Such a huge part of our culture and consciousness. Sending love to her family."

She was a truly amazing person, a great friend and an inspiration to all. I will always be grateful for her kindness and thankful beyond words for knowing her. She will be missed greatly." Donald Sutherland, who also starred with Moore in "Ordinary People," told ABC News in a statement, "Mary was and is and now always will be perfect. She was the perfect actor to work with, the performance she gave was perfect, painfully perfect, and the friendship she offered was perfect. I am in her thrall." Michael Keaton, her "Mary" co-star, said in a statement, "Mary Tyler Moore could light up a room! She is an icon and a friend. She was my castmate and my boss. She was incredibly funny and completely generous. As an actor and comedian, she allowed me and everyone to perform — letting us just do our thing without any competitiveness. She was not only a pioneer in TV, comedy and business, but she was a role model for women in general. She built an empire with MTM Enterprises, and she paved the way for our new talents like Amy, Tina and others. She is truly going to be missed."
