21 times Adele slayed beyond all expectations in 2016
21 times Adele slayed beyond all expectations in 2016
LONDON ‚Äî There are some people who have point-blank refused to let the ongoing misery of 2016 get them down. These people have battled on despite the tide of bad news, helping make the year that little bit less horrible for the rest of us. Adele definitely falls into this category. SEE ALSO: 27 times J.K. Rowling was the hero we all needed in 2016 From the moment she nailed Carpool Karaoke back in January to the moment she nailed, well, pretty much every minute of her tour, Adele has been a shining ray of awesomeness in 2016. Let us recap the moments. 1. Her record-breaking episode of Carpool Karaoke. Adele got the year off to a strong start with her hilarious, record-breaking Carpool Karaoke episode ; not only did she sing brilliantly and give an on-point rendition of the Spice Girl's hit song "Wannabe" (which Victoria Beckham herself approved of ), but she also did what Adele does best: just being generally lovable and funny. 2. The time she teamed up with Ellen to pull off this brilliant prank. If Adele ever gets fed up with the whole singing thing, she could definitely find work as an actor. Or a spy. During an appearance on , the singer pranked Jamba Juice employees by going undercover and carrying out increasingly odd requests that were relayed directly to her from Ellen, via earpiece. 3. Her reaction to seeing Lana Del Rey at the Brit Awards.

And her reaction to winning pretty much everything and getting a special congratulatory message from astronaut Tim Peake. After Adele cleaned up at the Brit Awards, she gave a moving (and, as always, amusing) speech . 5. The time she pulled two Irish fans up on stage to sing a medley of her songs. Adele may perform her songs solo, but that doesn't mean she's adverse to sharing the stage every now and then. After two Irish fans went viral with their cover of her songs, she pulled them up on stage in Dublin and gave them the chance to perform live . 6. And the time she brought this young fan up on stage for a duet. After spotting a little girl in the crowd who had a banner that read "It's my dream to sing with Adele", the singer decided to make it happen . 7. The time she shut down the people putting pressure on mothers to breastfeed. In between songs at her gig in London, Adele responded to a question from the audience about breastfeeding . She didn't beat around the bush with her reply. "You know what, the pressure on us is fucking ridiculous, and all those putting pressure on us, you can go fuck yourselves," she said (jump to 0:50 in the video above). 8. The time she posed for a selfie with a fan who kept getting mistaken for her. #AdeleLive2016  #AdeleBirmingham people won't stop saying that my Fianc√© üíç looks like @Adele  pic.twitter.com/WSqZ6newuu ‚Äî AllThingsTom (@TomWinkler06) March 29, 2016 If you tag Adele on Twitter before heading to one of her concerts, be prepared for the singer to take notice.

She is Jesus Fucking Christ." 10. The time she forgot her lyrics and styled it out like a pro.
