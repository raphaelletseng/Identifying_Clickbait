Mother, daughter die in grisly Czech sauna accident
Prague (AFP) - Two women died in a sauna in the northern Czech Republic after the door handle came off, trapping them inside, police said Sunday. "The mother and daughter aged 65 and 45 were taking a sauna at their friends' place in a garden colony," police spokeswoman Iva Kormosova said in a statement. "The owner thought they were taking too long to come out so she went to check and found them lying on the floor," she said, adding that the women had been in the sauna for around 90 minutes. Emergency services declared the women dead at the scene. "The handle on the sauna door broke and the women were trapped. They tried to break the window on the door but failed," said Kormosova. The accident occurred near the town of Jicin northeast of Prague on Saturday evening, police said. Post-mortem examinations are due to be held.
