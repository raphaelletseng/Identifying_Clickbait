It's hard to believe that 20 years ago, Selena Quintanilla'sÂ biopicÂ hit the big screen starring Jennifer Lopez. The release date was March 21, 1997, to be exact, just twoÂ years after the tragic death of Tejano music's rising star.Â

From Selena's humble beginnings as a singer to breaking into the male-dominated Tejano genre andÂ eventually becoming the "Queen of Tex-Mex," the movie, directed and written by the Oscar-nominatedÂ Gregory Nava, has become a staple in pop culture.Â

In honor of Selena'sÂ 20th anniversary, here are eight key moments of the film that we don't get tired of watching over and over again.

Humble & difficult beginnings

"Tejano music is all men; women are not successful," Selena's mom says in the movie. After starting to perform at a very young age with her brother and sister in a male-dominated genre, Selena quickly gained popularity and charmed the crowd with her talent and personality.

Busti-quela?

Selena was known for rocking the bustier, but at first, her father, Abraham Quintanilla, wasn't too happy to see his daughter singing and dancing in only a "bra" -- even after they try to explain to him that it's "one of those things ... like all the girls areÂ wearing."

"Busti-quela? It's a bra. Look at it."Â

Crowd Whisperer

During a packed concert at a fair, a rowdy crowd tries toÂ force their way closer to the stage, squeezing everyone in front and almost breaking the stage. While Selena's dad wants to cancel the show, she is convinced she can calm them down with her song "Como la flor." And it works.

"Anything for Salinas"

It didn't take long before Selena started getting recognized by her fans on the street, but her encounter with these two cholosÂ is pretty epic.

Being Mexican-American is tough

This Abraham Quintanilla monologueÂ pretty much sums up the Mexican-American experience. "We gotta prove to the Mexicans how Mexican we are and we gotta prove to the Americans how American we are."

Mall incident

A mall employee, who tried telling Selena that their dresses were "too expensive" for her, quickly learned that she was dealing with a music icon when fans started rushing into the store to get an autograph from the singer.

Marrying boyfriend and band member Chris

After falling in love with her guitarist -- a relationship that wasn't approved by her father, who evenÂ threatened to dismantleÂ the band if they didn't break up -- Selena and Chris decide to elope.Â

Dreaming of You

The movie ends with an emotional interpretation of "Dreaming of You," and while onstage, Selena doesn't catch a white rose thrown to her, foreshadowing a tragedy. The narrativeÂ picks up with the family at the hospital where Selena is pronounced dead after being shot by her fan club president and boutique managerÂ Yolanda Saldivar.Â

*Bonus: Disco queen

Not only could SelenaÂ sing Tejano, cumbia, norteÃ±as and mariachi, she was also a disco queen and an impeccable dancer.
