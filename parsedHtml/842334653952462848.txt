President Trump wants to cut this budget, even as he steps up border enforcement, hires more immigration judges and slightly increases the F.B.I. budget. Most of the cuts come from a budget maneuver in which funds classified as “mandatory,” like for the Crime Victims Fund, are reduced in order to offset discretionary spending. His budget also relies on cuts to prison construction, which the administration says can be accomplished because of the decline in the prison population under President Obama.One budget item to watch: Mr. Trump wants to hire 20 lawyers to obtain land in the Southwest, foreshadowing bitter legal fights with landowners from Texas to California over the seizure of private property. — MATT APUZZO
