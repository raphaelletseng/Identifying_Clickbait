Croydon 'hate crime': Six arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after attack on refugee boy
Six people have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a boy was assaulted and knocked unconscious in Croydon in a “brutal” suspected hate crime. Four men and two women were arrested late on Saturday, the Metropolitan Police said, on suspicion of attempted murder and violent disorder. Detectives believe a group of eight people chased the Kurdish-Iranian teen after discovering he was an asylum seeker “and launched a brutal attack,” they said on Sunday morning. Police and paramedics were called to Shrublands Avenue at 11.40pm on Friday after reports of a man being attacked. They found a 17-year-old boy with “serious head and facial injuries” who is now in stable condition in hospital. He had suffered a fractured skull and a blood clot on his brain. DS Kris Blamires, of Croydon CID, said: “At this early stage it is believed that about eight suspects approached the victim as he waited at a bus stop with two friends outside The Goat public house in the Shrublands.
