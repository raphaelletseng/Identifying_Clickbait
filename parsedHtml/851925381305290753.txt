Putting knives in the dishwasher: According to experts, high water pressures in your dishwasher are actually causing your knives to go slightly blunt.

It is advisable to hand wash them in the sink using soapy water and a dishcloth and dry them straight away rather than leaving them out, which, again, makes them less sharp.

Storing your fruit and vegetables together: If you pop all of your fruit and vegetables in the drawer of your fridge, it could be spoiling your foods quicker.

Experts say you should avoid leaving apples and bananas, which emit ethylene gas, next to vegetables as they could cause them to go bad sooner.

Storing hot food in plastic tupperware: Putting hot leftovers into a plastic food container causes endocrine-disrupting chemicals like BPA and BPS to leach into your food. These chemicals have been linked to obesity and some cancers.

Opening the oven to check on your food: Constantly checking to see if your food is perfectly cooked may well make the process take longer - and it could end up unevenly heated.

Storing the wrong foods in the fridge: It's vital we keep fresh food such as meat, fish and dairy products chilled in the fridge, or they could make us ill.

But when it comes to other grocery items, many of us are keeping far more foods than we need to in the refrigerator - like avocados, aubergines, and even butter.
