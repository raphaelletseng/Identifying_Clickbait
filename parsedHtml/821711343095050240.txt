"Ab yeh toh nahin keh sakte ki poore Noida mein kitni chori hoti hai, par sunne me aata hai sabse ki hafte mein do-teen incident ho jaati hain," says Ramesh, a pizza delivery boy with Dominos. Ramesh's colleague adds, "It's not as if they steal only one pizza when they rob you. Saare le jaate hain jitney ho aapke paas. Normally, a delivery boy carries 4-5 pizzas when out for delivery." Most cases not reported because 'pizza hi toh hai' The latest case took place on January 6, when Rajnish, a pizza delivery boy, was robbed in Sector 58. He tells us, "I had parked my bike, and was looking for the address, when three men came on a bike, and snatched the pizzas from me. Before I could react, they sped off towards Sector 57."

Awaaz aur baaton se toh padhe-likhe type lagte hain." They say that since many of these robberies are committed near college campuses, it might validate their assumption. Ravi, a delivery boy in Greater Noida, says, "Most of these incidents happen near Knowledge Park, where all the colleges are.

Even in Noida, the most common spots for pizza robberies include areas near Sector 58 and Sector 62 - both close to several colleges, apart from places like Sector 12, and places close to Expressway.

Delivery boys say that there is no specific time frame for such incidents. In busy areas, they take place usually after sunset, but in more remote areas like Expressway and Knowledge Park, incidents have taken place during broad daylight as well.

Managers thought we were lying about robbery: Delivery boys

When the robberies first started, a few years ago, delivery boys were faced with the difficulty of convincing their bosses that they were actually being robbed. Their superiors suspected them of selling the pizzas, and then reporting them as stolen. A pizza delivery boy at a joint in Sector 18, tells us, "Initially, it seemed funny, but when the incidents started happening more regularly, it became ridiculous. Shuru mein toh managers maante hi nahi thay ki aisa kuch hua hai. Kehte thay ki tum ne koi ghapla toh nahi kiya hai, aur ab keh rahe ho chori ho gaye. That is why we insisted on informing the police. Report na likhwayein, phir bhi bata toh dete hi hain police ko."
