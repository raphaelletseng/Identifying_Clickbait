Arnold Schwarzenegger Negged Nickelback and They Hit Back

Dissing Nickelback has become aÂ time-honored tradition. But when former California Governor and New Celebrity Apprentice hostÂ Arnold Schwarzenegger took a swing at the band on Valentine's Day, comparing the Canadian rockers to the very unpopular U.S. Congress (and herpes), they were not having it.

The group, who are working on a new album, responded that they were big fans, then snapped back with a mention of Ahnuld's disastrous turn as Mr. Freeze in 1997's reviled Batman & Robin movie.
