Julie Bishop plays down possibility of patrols with Indonesia in South China Sea

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has played down the possibility of joint Navy patrols with Indonesia in the South China Sea.

Attending the Indian Ocean Rim Association summit in Jakarta, Ms Bishop said Indonesian President Joko Widodo has never suggested joint exercises between the countries, despite reports prior to his visit to Sydney just over a week ago.

"The President, I believe, was talking about cooperation. He wasn't talking about joint exercises as such, he was talking about cooperation in maintaining freedom of overflight and freedom of navigation through the South China Sea," Ms Bishop said on the sidelines of the summit.

"Both Indonesia and Australia have a deep interest in unimpeded trade through these waters and through the skies of the South China Sea."

After being asked whether joint patrols would ever happen, Ms Bishop said: "I don't believe that's what he was suggesting."

During an interview with The Australian newspaper prior to his arrival in Sydney, Mr Widodo was quoted as saying: "If there is no tension, I think it's very important to have the patrols together."

The summit of 21 Indian Ocean rim nations has agreed on a declaration to counter terrorism and violent extremism, and on improving maritime security.

On the sidelines of the meeting, Australia's top priority is to secure a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Indonesia, which both nations have said they hope to have completed this year.

Malcolm Turnbull will attend the summit in the Indonesian capital tomorrow during a flying 24-hour visit.
