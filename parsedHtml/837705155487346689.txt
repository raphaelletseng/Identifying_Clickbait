"Awwww they're so fun but also soul crushing at this age." - me, meeting a child of any age Having 3 kids means I literally have no concept of what is or is not gross to normal people anymore. I don't always sleep in on Sunday mornings but when I do... Just kidding. I'm a parent. I don't sleep anymore. Taking my kids somewhere special for a treat is a great way to find out where they would have rather gone. I just broke up a fight over someone repeatedly calling someone else a “nightgown face,” if anyone wants to know what parenting is like. My favorite part of being corrected by my 6-year-old is how he's wrong 99% of the time. My least favorite part is that other 1%. My 5yo just popped his eyes open from a nap and said "What can I have for dinner?" so definitely my child. Everyone has practice so we can either have dinner at 4:30 or 9:00. 5pm, to kids: "Stop complaining that there's nothing good to eat here! Have some fruit!" 11pm, to self: "There's nothing good to eat here." Some days parenting is so rewarding and joyful and amazing… or so I’ve heard. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can, and will, be used against you by your child in a busy public setting. My 3-year-old is watching Beauty and the Beast for the first time. "Is that a broken cup?" He's wondering who is busted for breaking Chip. My parenting backup plan is to keep handing out snacks. Practice makes perfect. And headaches, when it's Mary Had a Little Lamb for the bazillionth time on a recorder for school. The worst part of my husband getting up with the kids is trying to decide if I should join him, or escape out the window & start a new life. Having a house full of cold-ridden kids isn't so bad when you give up on life and let them watch Netflix for 12 hours a day You are NEVER watching Wild Kratts again!! *and other irrational bedtime threats When I go grocery shopping without my kids, I use that freedom to get so much food that people must think I’m a doomsday prepper. My fairy tale ending: 3yo is finally, truly potty trained and the old pee smell that has become my constant laundry companion is vanquished. I told my kid I wasn't going to pick up after him anymore, and then we laughed and laughed. I cherish these moments together. 6: Mom I'm sad that you're sick Me: Aw, I'll get better soon, ur so swee- 6: That's good bc I can't reach the cookies Me: 6: It's so sad CURRENT MOOD: I can hear everyone snore in my house. pic.twitter.com/iyJUu8B7KB ALSO ON HUFFPOST Cute Kid Notes       Share this slide:       MORE:
