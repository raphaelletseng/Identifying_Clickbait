Hundreds of people would drive past wondering what his story must be, until one day, Ginger Sprouse, decided to stop by and ask him. When Sprouse approached Victor last December, she learned that he stood on a street corner waiting and hoping to reunite with his mother who abandoned him. That's when Sprouse set up a Facebook page called 'This is Victor' to spread the word. Since then, there's been no turning back. The Facebook page has garnered 29,000 followers. Thousands of people have volunteered to help Victor start a new life, along with Sprouse, who helped him wash clothes, set up appointments with mental health experts. She also managed to get him a job in her own company called Art of Meal as a chef. "We have Victor in a warm, safe place, he has plenty of new clothes, food, and a brand new bike. He has been seen by a doctor and our wonderful Webster Fire Department is overseeing his medication. We have lined up a dentist and eye doctor." wrote Sprouse. Sprouse also set up a GoFundMe page to help raise funds for Victor. The page has raised over $22,427 in two months. Since setting the Facebook page and GoFundMe pages, Victor has been able to get in touch with his uncle and more recently he was reunited with his mother.
