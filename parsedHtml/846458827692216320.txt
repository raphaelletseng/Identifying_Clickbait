Delta Comes For United Airlines With Sick 'Leggings' Burn On Twitter
Delta is having none of United Airlines’ block on leggings On Monday the airline called out United on Twitter, just one day after United stopped three girls in leggings from boarding its plane. Flying Delta means comfort. (That means you can wear your leggings. 😉) Twitter users couldn’t handle Delta’s shady tweet: @Delta don't need sunglasses today, since Delta just threw alllllll the shade . @Delta DRAG THEM DELTA @Delta Oh SNAP! On Sunday, United forced three girls, one reportedly as young as 10 years old, to change before they were allowed on the plane. The incident was documented via Twitter by gun control activist Shannon Watts . Many people and celebrities, including actress Patricia Arquette , got involved in a Twitter debate with the airline, defending the girls’ choice to wear leggings. Because the three girls were “pass travelers,” meaning they were passengers traveling as relatives or dependents of a United employee, the airline defended its decision to ask the girls to change. “There is a dress code for pass travelers as they are representing UA when they fly,” a tweet from the airline stated on Sunday. United eventually released a statement clarifying the differences in pass rider dress versus regular passenger dress. “When taking advantage of this benefit, all employees and pass riders are considered representatives of United. And like most companies, we have a dress code that we ask employees and pass riders to follow,” the statement read. “To our regular customers, your leggings are welcome.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST Celebrity News & Photos: 2017       Share this slide:       MORE:
