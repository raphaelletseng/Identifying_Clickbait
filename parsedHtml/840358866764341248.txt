Stephen Colbert has torn into Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for having dinner with President Donald Trump at the White House.

On Thursday’s broadcast of the “Late Show,” the host recalled how the two GOP presidential candidates had repeatedly crossed swords during the 2016 nomination campaign.

Trump repeatedly called his opponent “Lyin’ Ted” and retweeted an unfavorable photograph of the Texan senator’s wife, Heidi Cruz. He also insinuated that his father, Rafael Cruz, was linked to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Cruz, meanwhile, called Trump a “pathological liar,” “utterly amoral” and a “serial philanderer.”

But the pair now appear to be getting on well enough for Trump to ask Cruz and his daughters over for food, and it doesn’t sit well with Colbert.

To make his point, Colbert created a fake invitation on behalf of the Trumps. “You and your wife (who is a 3 at best) are invited to dinner,” it read. “Cocktail attire, please check your spine at the door.”
