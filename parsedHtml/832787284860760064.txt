The penguin, which could be identified by the number 53 on its wing, was found by a passerby, a police spokesman said.

Officers said the unknown thief probably dropped the penguin near the car park.

It was not clear whether the bird was already dead at the time.

The zoo's director called the death of penguin number 53 the 'worst possible outcome'.

Joachim Koeltzsch said: 'All of us are shocked about the death.'

The Humboldt penguin is a South American breed native to coastal Chile and Peru.

The breed is known for its kind nature and intelligence. In 2012 one of the 135 Humboldt penguins living at Tokyo Sea Life Park escaped after apparently scaling a 13 foot high wall.

It reportedly managed to survived 82 days in the wild before it was recaptured by the zoo keepers.
