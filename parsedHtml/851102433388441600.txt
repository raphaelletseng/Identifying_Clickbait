The Chainsmokers made their Saturday Night Live debut on the April 8 episode, hot on the heels of their first studio album, Memories... Do Not Open, which dropped Friday.Â



Drew Taggart and Alex Pall performed "Paris," the lead single from the new album, released at the beginning of the year.Â The second performance was "Break Up Every Night" -- not their second Memories single "Something Just Like This."

The EDM duo is having a great year. They won a Grammy for Best Dance Recording, and in March, became the third group to have three simultaneous top 10 hits on theÂ Billboard Hot 100 chart. And now this, their SNL debut.
