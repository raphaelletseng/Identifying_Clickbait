Don't Be This Guy Who Asked His Job Interviewer Out On A Date
Don't Be This Guy Who Asked His Job Interviewer Out On A Date
Pro tip: Job interviews are job interviews, not opportunities to find love. Product designer Katarina Batina tweeted a screenshot of an email she received from a man asking her on a date. Ordinarily, asking a woman out via email wouldn’t be problematic, except that Batina had just interviewed this particular man for a job. And she’s not even interested in men. 🚨ATTENTION ALL MALE DEVELOPERS🚨 Do not under any circumstances ask your interviewer out on a DATE #harassment  #commonsense  #shemightbegay  pic.twitter.com/kfJVP3gkpe The tweet has been retweeted more than 1200 times, and has received dozens of replies. Many of the replies are from men who seem incredulous about Batina’s assertion that the email was a form of harassment. @katarinabatina hm, maybe I’m living in the wrong country, but why is this considered a harassment? If it was woman->man would it still be? @katarinabatina  @annelibby unless you're more interested in her than the job...which is also fine. @katarinabatina  @UINT_MIN Clueless, sure. Borderline stupid, sure. But I’m not sure I understand the harassment hashtag? Help me with that? From there, the responses went in all sorts of directions. Some people explained why asking someone out after they interview you for a job is indeed inappropriate: @chrstnerode  @GregoryMaks  @katarinabatina It's inappropriate because she didn't go to the interview looking for a date. It's her job. @drakecode  @desjardins  @chrstnerode  @GregoryMaks  @katarinabatina It's 100% inappropriate no matter what gender initiated it. Others took issue with the fact that Batina was frustrated by the incident at all. @infamylives  @jessicafung_ I don't want to sound rude, but it seems like quite a few women these days have a kind of "victim mentality" @justkelly_ok  @Carbamide  @UINT_MIN men: logically treating it for what it is, a humorous if misguided proposition; women: flipping out Overall, the exchange and its aftermath can pretty much be summed up by this screenshot: Stick to Tinder, friends. Or, you know, maybe just don’t try to date someone who just interviewed you for a job. Not only will you probably not get hired, but you’ll also have seriously crossed the line of appropriate workplace behavior.
