Bull shark steals a fish right off a fisherman's line
"Oh my f*ck." Fisherman were surprised to see a rogue bull shark doing a little bit of opportunist fishing on the Breede River in Western Cape, South Africa, last month. The men noticed the shark in the water, and sure enough, it snagged a fish right off their line as they reeled it in to the boat. While bull sharks are commonly seen near the mouth of the river, this video was taken 28 kilometers upstream, so it was quite a shock to see the shark in an area where people typically play in the river.
