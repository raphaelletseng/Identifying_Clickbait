The man forcibly removed from a United flight went to the hospital for his injuries


The man who was captured on video beingÂ forcibly removed from a United Airlines flightÂ suffered injuries to his face and was taken to a local hospital for treatment, Chicago Police wrote in a statementÂ to NBC News reporter Bradd Jaffy.

According to the police statement, the 69-year-old Asian male was forcibly removed by Chicago Police after refusing to give up his seat on the overbooked flight, which was traveling from Chicago to Louisville. The airline says it first asked volunteersÂ to leave in exchange for $800, but then told several people they had to leave when no one volunteered.

The man began voicing his "displeasure" when he was told he had to get off the plane, leading the airline to summon aviation officers, according to the statement.Â

"Aviation Officers arrived on scene attempted to carry the individual off the flight when he fell," the Chicago Police said in the statement. "His head subsequently struck an armrest causing injuries to his face. The man was taken to Lutheran General Hospital with non-life threatening injuries."

The police department saidÂ the investigation is still ongoing.
