Ed Sheeran 's "Shape of You" rebounds from No. 2 to No. 1 for a second total week atop the Billboard Hot 100 (dated Feb. 18). Meanwhile, Zayn and Taylor Swift rise 5-3 with "I Don't Wanna Love Forever (Fifty Shades Darker)," with both songs benefiting from newly released official videos. As we do every Monday, let's run down the top 10 of the Hot 100, which blends sales, airplay and streaming data. All charts will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Feb. 7. In its fourth week on the Hot 100, Sheeran's "Shape of You" returns to No. 1; it had spent the past two weeks at No. 2 following its bow at No. 1 on the Jan. 28-dated chart. With its official video having premiered Jan. 30, the song gains by 19 percent to 31.7 million U.S. streams in the week ending Feb. 2, according to Nielsen Music, and holds at No. 2 on the Streaming Songs chart. It increases by 11 percent to 115,000 downloads sold, although it dips to No. 2 after logging its first three weeks on Digital Song Sales at No. 1. On Radio Songs, "Shape" pushes 5-3 (116 million in audience, up 24 percent), good for the Hot 100's top Airplay Gainer award for a third straight week. Notably, as it ranks at Nos. 2, 2 and 3 on Streaming Songs, Digital Song Sales and Radio Songs, respectively, "Shape" is the first song to top the Hot 100 but not rank at No. 1 on any of those component charts in more than six months, since Sia's "Cheap Thrills," featuring Sean Paul, led the Hot 100 but not any of those tallies on Aug. 13, 2016. "Shape" previews Sheeran's third studio album , due March 3.  Migos ' "Bad and Boujee," featuring Lil Uzi Vert , drops to No. 2 on the Hot 100 after three nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1, fueled in part by memes and tweets playing off the song's "raindrop, drop top" lyrics. Still, the track tops the Streaming Songs chart for a sixth week with 50 million U.S. streams (up 8 percent), its greatest weekly total yet. It also leads the audio subscription services-based On-Demand Streaming Songs chart for a sixth week (23.1 million on-demand clicks, up 17 percent). "Boujee" slides 3-5 on Digital Song Sales (43,000 downloads sold, down 16 percent) but bounds 23-16 on Radio Songs, gaining by 19 percent to 59 million in airplay audience. It additionally rules Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts for a fifth week each. As previously reported, Migos' second full-length, (featuring the track), arrives as the hip-hop trio's first No. 1 on the Billboard 200, Top R&B Hip-Hop Albums and Top Rap Albums.  Zayn and Taylor Swift's "I Don't Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker)" climbs 5-3 on the Hot 100, a new high for the song in its eighth week on the chart. Following a full week of tracking after the Jan. 26 premiere of its official video, it claims the Hot 100's top Digital and Streaming Gainer trophies, jumping 2-1 for a second week atop Digital Song Sales (137,000, up 124 percent, aided by a 69-cent sale-price in the iTunes Store) and 12-3 on Streaming Songs (25.7 million, up 58 percent). On Radio Songs, "Forever" flies 11-7 (89 million, up 15 percent), becoming Swift's 12th Radio Songs top 10 and Zayn's second. "Forever" is the lead single from the soundtrack, with both the album and the movie arriving Friday (Feb. 10). Notably, as the song reaches No. 3, it ties for the highest-charting hit from the Fifty Shades franchise. 2015's Fifty Shades of Grey yielded the No. 3-peaking Ellie Goulding's "Love Me Like You Do" and The Weeknd's "Earned It (Fifty Shades of Grey)." Machine Gun Kelly and Camila Cabello 's "Bad Things" holds at its No. 4 high on the Hot 100. It backtracks 3-4 on Radio Songs but with a 2 percent gain to 111 million; keeps at No. 4 on Digital Song Sales (43,000, up 3 percent); and descends 11-12 on Streaming Songs, although its total of 16.7 million is essentially even from the prior week. As previously reported, the track tops the Pop Songs airplay chart (2-1), marking Kelly's first No. 1 on the chart and Cabello's first as a soloist; before leaving Fifth Harmony, she led the list as a member of 5H with "Work From Home" (featuring Ty Dolla $ign) last June.  Rounding out the Hot 100's top five, The Chainsmokers ' "Closer," featuring Halsey , retreats 3-5, after spending 12 weeks at No. 1. It extends its record for the most weeks logged in the top 10 from a song's debut, having totaled all 27 of its weeks on the chart in the top 10 since its bow at No. 9 on Aug. 20. Meanwhile, with a 25th week in the top five, "Closer" ties two singles for the most top-five weeks in the chart's 58-year history: Mark Ronson's "Uptown Funk!," featuring Bruno Mars (2015) and LeAnn Rimes' "How Do I Live" (1997-98). "Closer" also tops the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart for a 25th week, pulling within one of the record for the most weeks at No. 1 since the chart launched in January 2013: Avicii's "Wake Me Up!" reigned for 26 weeks in 2013-14. Maroon 5 's "Don't Wanna Know," featuring Kendrick Lamar , reaches a new Hot 100 highpoint, lifting 7-6, while ruling Radio Songs for an eighth week (129 million, down 5 percent). The band ties its longest Radio Songs rule: its "One More Night" led for eight weeks in 2012. The Weeknd 's "Starboy" rebounds 8-7 on the Hot 100 after its one week at No. 1, while leading Hot R&B Songs for a 19th week; Drake 's "Fake Love" climbs to a new best rank on the Hot 100 (9-8); Rae Sremmurd 's "Black Beatles," featuring Gucci Mane , slides 6-9, following its seven-week command; and Alessia Cara's "Scars to Your Beautiful" remains at its No. 10 peak so far.
