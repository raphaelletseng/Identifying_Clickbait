Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman may have an explanation for the struggles Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers have faced this season.

Sherman was speaking to reporters Wednesday when he was asked about an incident that happened last January. As Rob Perez of FoxSports.com explained, the Panthers quarterback ripped a "12th Man" flag from a Seahawks fan and threw it on the ground after his team defeated Seattle to advance to the NFC Championship Game.

Sherman didn't hold back, via Bob Condotta of the Seattle Times:
