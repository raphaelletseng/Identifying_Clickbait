Batsman accidentally kills teenage cricketer in Bangladesh
Furious batsman accidentally kills a 14-year-old cricketer


The batsman flew into a rage after being given out and flung the cricket stump in the victim's direction, police have said

A teenage cricketer has died from horrific neck injuries after an angry batsman hurled a stump at him.

The tragedy unfolded during a game in Bangladesh.

Despite efforts to save him, 14-year-old Faisal Hossain died from his injuries in the southeastern port city of Chittagong.

Police said the batsman flew into a rage after he was given out during a friendly game between neighbourhood teams.

Assistant police commissioner Jahangir Alam said: 'The batsman was furious when he saw that he was stumped or bowled out.

'He grabbed a stump and threw it in the air. The stump hit part of the neck and head of Faisal who was fielding close to the wicket.

'He collapsed on the ground in pain and was declared dead after he was taken to a hospital.'

The man who threw the stump will be prosecuted for causing unintentional death, police said.

Clashes are common over cricket in Bangladesh, where the sport is taken seriously even at village level.

Last May, a batsman wielding a stump allegedly beat a 16-year-old cricketer to death in Dhaka after the teenager taunted the umpire over a no-ball delivery.
