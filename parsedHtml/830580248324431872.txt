Thunder Fans Show Up Well Prepared for Kevin Durant's Return to Oklahoma City
They probably won't let these fans --or snakes--in for Durant's return game. I'm guessing the game's not their point though https://t.co/JDVIAHToEq In case you missed the news, Kevin Durant joined the Golden State Warriors in the offseason. The move caused a lot of discussion, especially because the Warriors eliminated Durant's previous team, the Oklahoma City Thunder , in the playoffs last season. Much was made of the fact that the former MVP didn't reach out to teammate and fellow superstar Russell Westbrook before his decision. Durant returns to OKC on Saturday night for the first time since he left, and the Thunder fans were ready to "welcome" him. From signs, props and T-shirts, fans put serious thought into their statements: KD just smiled at these two as he walked off the court https://t.co/Cc9CSHG5Nl Outside the Warriors hotel https://t.co/cvuAGjeG0v @royceyoung @Thunder_Digest just outside the arena https://t.co/Xhe6RlNE4N Just in case yall thought I was playing #OKCvsGSW #InRussWeTrust https://t.co/mfzj4ejtG5 [Twitter] Like the new article format?
