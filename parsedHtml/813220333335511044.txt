As Ovarian Cancer Destroys Her Body, This Female Bodybuilder Is Instagramming Her Battle A popular bodybuilder, who built up a huge following on social media by posting health tips and workout clips, is now documenting her battle with cancer. Cheyann Shaw was diagnosed with stage 4 low-grade serous ovarian cancer, shortly before her wedding in August this year. The illness, which is a rare form of cancer, grows slowly and stubbornly due to its resistance to chemotherapy. The 23-year-old began sharing her swift decline from a 130-pound bodybuilder to a 102-pound cancer patient to show that having cancer “doesn’t mean you stop living.” It's crazy where life can take you in just a short year. - - This time last year, I was on stage competing in my first fitness show💪🏻 Now I'm fighting for my life. - - The picture on the left is around the time they think my cancer started to form and we just caught it in August. Thankfully we have caught it in enough time that I am still able to fight and can kick Ovarian Cancers ass and be in remission one day, hopefully soon💙 - - At the end of the day, my life isn't where I ever expected it to be, but I'm thankful I am where I am. I truly believe God has a plan for me and I believe it's to help and inspire people. Just because you are going thru something, doesn't mean you stop living. I still go to the gym, I still laugh, cry, sing (horribly🙃), and just enjoy each and every second of every single day. - - Life is all about what you make it out to be; and I'll be damned if I let a little bit of cancer stop me from living my life to the fullest👍🏻💙 - - #fuckcancer #ovariancancer #selflove #bestself #fitspo #fitfam #fitlife #gymspo #npc #npcbikini #npcbikinicompetitor #npcathlete #gymshark #alphalete #squats #loveyourself #youtube #follow A photo posted by Cheyann Shaw (@cheymarie_fit) on Oct 10, 2016 at 7:25pm PDT   Soon after her diagnosis, Shaw started chemotherapy. She lost her hair – and filmed the moment she shaved her head. She underwent surgery to remove her reproductive organs, appendix, spleen and part of her colon, along with a tumor from her abdomen that was the size of a small beach ball. Post surgery update!! - - It's been about 2 almost 3 weeks since surgery and I'm feeling great. I've only been home for a couple days but it feels amazing. So I have a nice little scar and that bag.....that bag is my "poop bag" - - There unfortunately was cancer on my colon so they had to take some colon out and to give it time to heal redirected everything to my side. I'll have this bag for about 3 months and will get everything reversed and be back to normal. But for now I can walk and poop so don't judge me 👌🏻 - - When they were in surgery they did find out I'm actually Stage 4 because the cancer was in my spleen and I do have cancer in my lymph nodes, but I'm not worried. Just another bump to get over and with GOD by my side I'm not scared. I'll be fine and GOD will get me through this. I have a story to tell and I'm not done telling it and GOD knows that🙏🏻 - - I'm proud of my scar and "poop bag" because it already shows that I'm a fighter and a survivor. I wear my war wounds proudly💙💪🏻💪🏻 - - #fuckcancer #ovariancancer #seattleseahawks #bestself #selflove #npc #npcbikini #ifbb #npccompetitor #bikini #bikinicompetitor #bikinifitness #bikiniathlete #fitlife  #fitspo #fitlife #follow #inspiration #happiness #womensfitness #womenshealth #motivation #squat #squatspo #country #countrymusic #countrygirl #smile A photo posted by Cheyann Shaw (@cheymarie_fit) on Nov 17, 2016 at 8:30pm PST   Even after that, Shaw learnt that the therapy wasn’t working. This is hard for me to post... Left- Before we knew I had cancer. I was a solid 130lbs and 15% body fat. Also had a nice little booty growing back there. - - Right- Taken yesterday. Stage 4 Low Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer. After almost 14 days in the hospital, a poop bag, and a major surgery; I stand at 105lbs. That's way to small for me. I'm 5"5. I lost everything. Cancer has taken so much from me. The body I worked so hard for 2 years to get, the ability to have and carry my own child, my hair, and so much more, but one thing for sure is that cancer has not taken my fight and faith. - - I will never stop fighting. I will never lose my faith. I will never let cancer win. Today has been a rough day for me mentally, but that's okay. I know tomorrow will be much better and I'm thankful to be alive and to see another day. I know GOD is up there working and I know he will give me the strength to fight, the light to see in the darkness, and will lay his healing hands on me. - - This is the toughest battle I have and will ever face, but I know I can do it. The hardest part of all this is my body change. I have a hard time looking at myself in the mirror but I'm learning to love myself again and I know this is only temporary. Once I get the clear light to workout, I'll be in the gym banging those weights💪🏻💪🏻 - - #fuckcancer #ovariancancer #seattleseahawks #bestself #selflove #npc #npcbikini #ifbb #npccompetitor #bikini #bikinicompetitor #bikinifitness #bikiniathlete #fitlife  #fitspo #fitlife #follow #inspiration #happiness #womensfitness #womenshealth #motivation #squat #squatspo #country #countrymusic #countrygirl #smile #cheystrong A photo posted by Cheyann Shaw (@cheymarie_fit) on Nov 22, 2016 at 6:41pm PST   Despite losing so much, Shaw has maintained a positive outlook on life. “I lost everything.

TOI

Cheyann Shaw was diagnosed with stage 4 low-grade serous ovarian cancer, shortly before her wedding in August this year. The illness, which is a rare form of cancer, grows slowly and stubbornly due to its resistance to chemotherapy.

The 23-year-old began sharing her swift decline from a 130-pound bodybuilder to a 102-pound cancer patient to show that having cancer “doesn’t mean you stop living.”

Soon after her diagnosis, Shaw started chemotherapy. She lost her hair – and filmed the moment she shaved her head. She underwent surgery to remove her reproductive organs, appendix, spleen and part of her colon, along with a tumor from her abdomen that was the size of a small beach ball.

Even after that, Shaw learnt that the therapy wasn’t working.

Despite losing so much, Shaw has maintained a positive outlook on life.

Shaw’s posts have garnered widespread attention and there has been an outpouring of support and admiration.

“You are so strong and with the attitude you have, you will beat this. Sending prayers and positive vibes to you!” a well-wisher posted on Shaw’s Instagram.

Another supporter wrote, “Your scars make you look stronger than any muscle could. Fight on.”
