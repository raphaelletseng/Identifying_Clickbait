Berlin terrorist hunt intensifies as officers arrest four friends


Police raided a mosque in Berlin tonight as they searched for Europe's most wanted man.

Elite commando units hunting for Anis Amri, 24, blew up the front door, threw in stun grenades and witnesses reported hearing gunfire.

The target was the 'Fussilet 33' association's building in Perleberger Straße in the south-east of the capital. Neighbouring flats are also being searched, according to German media.

It was raided in 2015 over allegations they were raising money for extremists in Syria. An imam was put under investigation.

This morning four associates of Amri were arrested as police raided addresses across the country.

Merkel hopes for 'quick arrest' of the Tunisian truck terror suspect German Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced hope Thursday that the prime suspect in Berlin's deadly truck attack would be caught quickly, after it emerged that the Tunisian rejected asylum seeker was a known jihadist. In an act of defiance, Berliners flocked to the same Christmas market that witnessed the murder of 12 people on Monday, as it reopened for the first time in three days. Just as Merkel praised the country for not succumbing to fear in the wake of the attack, she insisted that authorities would manage to track down the alleged assailant. 'I am certain we will meet this test we are facing,' she said, voicing confidence for a 'hopefully quick arrest'. 'In the past few days I have been very proud of how calmly most people reacted to the situation.' Prosecutors have issued a Europe-wide wanted notice for 24-year-old Tunisian Anis Amri, offering a 100,000-euro ($104,000) reward for information leading to his arrest and warning he could be armed and dangerous. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the case against Amri was hardening, with his fingerprints found in the cab of the 40-tonne truck, as well as his temporary residence permit. The articulated lorry rammed through the crowd late Monday, killing 12. The twelfth victim, the hijacked truck's Polish driver, was found shot in the cab. Berliners returned Thursday to the market at the central Breitscheid square, leaving a sea of flowers and candles for the victims and signs reading 'Love Not Hate'.

The men were held in Dortmund - where Amri once lived with a hate preacher. The men have reportedly had close contact with him in recent months.

A flat was also raided in Berlin, but was empty, and a shelter for asylum seekers was searched in Emmerich, eastern Germany, where one man was questioned.

A major shopping centre in Berlin was also put on lockdown today after a suspicious package was found although this is understood to be unrelated to the hunt for Amri.

A street was cordoned off and part of the underground closed.

Anis Amri is the subject of an international manhunt after the attack left 12 dead and dozens injured.

The 24-year-old apparently arrived in Germany in July last year having left his home country for Italy in 2011 after the Arab Spring uprisings.

He applied for asylum in April and his claim was rejected in July, but he could not be deported because Tunisia initially claimed he was not a citizen and he did not have the correct papers to be repatriated, according to reports.

A European Arrest Warrant was said to show he used six different names under three nationalities.

After the manhunt was launched, reports emerged that Amri had been under surveillance earlier this year.

He was monitored for more than six months by German authorities after they received a tip that he may have been planning a break-in to finance buying automatic weapons for an attack.

But agencies stopped watching Amri in September after nothing was found to substantiate the original warning.

The operation was reportedly halted after turning up nothing more than him dealing drugs in a Berlin park and getting involved in a bar brawl.

However, officials said security agencies swapped counter-terrorism information about him as recently as November.

Reports on Thursday claimed Amri served four years for arson in Italy before he entered Germany.

One of his brothers was quoted by the Associated Press as suggesting that Amri may have been radicalised in prison in Italy.

Earlier, German interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said Amri was suspected of involvement in Monday's terrorist outrage but was not necessarily the man who drove the lorry into a crowded Christmas market in the German capital.

His identity papers were found under the driver's seat of the lorry, Der Spiegel said. It has now been claimed his fingerprints were on the door.

Death toll could rise as the injured fight for their lives Berlin's state government has said 12 people are still being treated for severe injuries after Monday night's truck attack on a Christmas market, and that an unspecified number of them are still in critical condition. Another 14 people with less serious injuries were also still hospitalized, while 30 others have been discharged. Twelve people were killed in the attack. Berlin's state health ministry on Thursday raised the number of market attack victims treated in Berlin hospitals to 56, up from 48. It said some victims had reached hospitals on their own after the attack.

A European Arrest Warrant was said to show he used six different names under three nationalities.

His identity papers were found under the driver's seat of the lorry, Der Spiegel said.

The Berlin Christmas market reopened today as the grieving city sought a return to normal life and police hunted for the prime suspect in the attack.

The wooden huts selling mulled wine, sausages, toys and seasonal decorations are run by people who saw the horror unfold.

But the section where the truck cut a bloody swathe through the market on Monday remains sealed off.

The Berlin association of market vendors said the decision to reopen the market was not an easy one.

'We are still stunned and deeply shocked. Our thoughts are with the injured, the dead and their families,' the association's chairman Michael Roden said.

'In a situation like this it's very difficult to know what the right thing to do is.'
