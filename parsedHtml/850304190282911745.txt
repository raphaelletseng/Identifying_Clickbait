YouTube adverts blocked on videos from channels with under 10,000 views
'We’ve started seeing cases of abuse where great, original content is re-uploaded by others who try to earn revenue from it'   YouTube has made changes to its ad policy in order to discourage channels from stealing content from other sources. From now on, channels won’t be able to make money until their videos have generated 10,000 views. Ads won’t appear on creators’ videos until they manage to hit this target, with YouTube believing that the 10,000 figure is high enough to give it enough time to work out whether a channel is playing by its rules or not.

Google announces measures to crack down on extremist ad placement Over 250 companies have suspended contracts with Google, and analysts have predicted that the firm could lose up to $750 million as a result of the backlash . “In a few weeks, we’ll also be adding a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program,” continued Mr Bardin. “After a creator hits 10k lifetime views on their channel, we’ll review their activity against our policies. If everything looks good, we’ll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content.” More about: Youtube Google Advertising Comments
