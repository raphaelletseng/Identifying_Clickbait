Nokia 3310, Everyone’s Favourite Phone Is Back! Nokia 3 & 5 Android Phones Also Revealed!!

Nokia’s return is finally complete. The company wasted no time in winning hearts at Mobile World Congress 2017 by unleashing Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and a re-imagined Nokia 3310 smartphone. Also, Snake -- everyone’s beloved game -- is back on Facebook! Try it out right now through Facebook Messenger.

New Nokia 3310 in all its glory!

The revamped, relaunched Nokia 3310 has 22 hours of continuous talk time, and 1 month standby battery time. The Nokia 3310’s running on Nokia’s Series 30+ OS, sporting a 2.4-inch QVGA display and a 2MP camera, and a microSD slot. But no one cares about all of that. It has Snake and it has the original Nokia ringtone! Specs be damned, what else do you need?

After all we all love the Nokia 3310, don’t we? Like this ex-soldier from Britain whose Nokia 3310 has survived war and washing machine to work amazingly well even after 17 years. Earlier this month, multiple reports claimed that the Nokia 3310 would reappear on the stage at MWC 2017 and that its European price would be set at 59 Euro, which is just over Rs 4,000 in India (as a direct comparison). There was no price confirmation for the Nokia 3310 at today’s Nokia Mobile World Congress announcement, but HMD Global had mentioned earlier that it would retail at 49 Euros or just over Rs 4,000 at launch.

Nokia also showcased two new smartphones at Mobile World Congress, 2017 -- the Nokia 5 and Nokia 3. Nokia 5 is a 5.2-inch form factor Android smartphone. Its uniqueness is a 3D surface shaped out of a single aluminium block. Nokia 5 will retail for approximately 189 Euros or just over Rs 13,000. Nokia 3 will retail for 139 Euros or just under Rs 10,000 and has a 5-inch form factor, and is crafted out of a single aluminium block. Its front camera has an 8MP sensor meant for wide angle selfies.

Nokia 6, Nokia 5, Nokia 3 and Nokia 3310 -- Nokia

Earlier in January, Nokia had already launched the Nokia 6 Android smartphone. That wasn’t the flagship Nokia smartphone, not by a long way, but it was a good start to the year for Nokia. Announced by HMD, Nokia 6 sports a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, Android 7.0 OS, 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, 4G LTE, 16MP rear and 8MP front cameras and dual SIM capability, not to mention 3,000 mAh battery capacity.

All the three Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 will launch in global markets in Q2 2017 -- between April to June 2017, no confirmation if India’s one of those countries. But we’d all be surprised if India isn’t one of the first markets for these new Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 Android smartphones to launch as they hit global markets. All Nokia smartphones (made by HMD) will feature the purest form of Android seen outside of Google smartphones in the past.
