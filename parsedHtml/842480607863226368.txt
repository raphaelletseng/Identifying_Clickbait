(AP Photo/John Minchillo) Here’s a parable about the food industry: In 1837, two young immigrants to Cincinnati—a candlemaker from England and a soap maker from Ireland—married a pair of sisters. The two men didn’t know one another beforehand, but their new father-in-law, no doubt looking out for his daughters’ interests, made them a “suggestion”: they should go into business together. Taking the not-so-subtle hint, William Procter and James Gamble each threw $3,000 into the pot and formed the partnership that would eventually become the consumer product behemoth Procter & Gamble. After that little anecdote, histories of Procter & Gamble tend to focus on the stream of brand name products that followed: Ivory Soap, Tide, Crisco, Crest etc. But this string commercial successes obscures a basic question: How did an English candlemaker and an Irish soap maker end up in Cincinnati in the first place? Here’s a clue: Cincinnati’s nickname at the time was “Porkopolis.” By around 1820, the advent of the steamboat had turned Ohio into the breadbasket for the country. This was partly due to the state’s flourishing agriculture sector; but it was also because of Cincinnati’s strategic location on the Ohio River. And one of Cincinnati’s most profitable exports was meat. Pig and cattle farmers across the state would drive their livestock to the city to be slaughtered, and the meat was shipped both upstream to the rapidly industrializing cities of the East, and downstream to help feed the growing slave population of the South. Consequently, Cincinnati was home to dozens of meatpacking plants. And these grisly abattoirs didn’t just produce meat. They also created an abundant supply of excess fat and lard, the key ingredients, as it happens, for Proctor & Gambles’ soap and candles. For its first 60 years, most of the company’s income came from candles made from highly rendered Cincinnati lard. And when the invention of gaslights and, later, electric lights, snuffed out the candle business around the turn of the century, that same fat was mixed with lye and perfume to produce “99 and 44/100 percent pure” Ivory Soap. It’s fair to say Procter & Gambles would never have existed if it weren’t for the meatpackers of Cincinnati. And it wasn’t only Procter & Gambles. By the middle of the 19th Century, dozens of candle manufacturers, soap makers, tanneries, and glue factories were thriving on the effluent stream of all those meatpackers.

Here’s a parable about the food industry:

In 1837, two young immigrants to Cincinnati—a candlemaker from England and a soap maker from Ireland—married a pair of sisters. The two men didn’t know one another beforehand, but their new father-in-law, no doubt looking out for his daughters’ interests, made them a “suggestion”: they should go into business together. Taking the not-so-subtle hint, William Procter and James Gamble each threw $3,000 into the pot and formed the partnership that would eventually become the consumer product behemoth Procter & Gamble.

After that little anecdote, histories of Procter & Gamble tend to focus on the stream of brand name products that followed: Ivory Soap, Tide, Crisco, Crest etc. But this string commercial successes obscures a basic question: How did an English candlemaker and an Irish soap maker end up in Cincinnati in the first place?

Here’s a clue: Cincinnati’s nickname at the time was “Porkopolis.”

By around 1820, the advent of the steamboat had turned Ohio into the breadbasket for the country. This was partly due to the state’s flourishing agriculture sector; but it was also because of Cincinnati’s strategic location on the Ohio River. And one of Cincinnati’s most profitable exports was meat. Pig and cattle farmers across the state would drive their livestock to the city to be slaughtered, and the meat was shipped both upstream to the rapidly industrializing cities of the East, and downstream to help feed the growing slave population of the South. Consequently, Cincinnati was home to dozens of meatpacking plants. And these grisly abattoirs didn’t just produce meat. They also created an abundant supply of excess fat and lard, the key ingredients, as it happens, for Proctor & Gambles’ soap and candles. For its first 60 years, most of the company’s income came from candles made from highly rendered Cincinnati lard. And when the invention of gaslights and, later, electric lights, snuffed out the candle business around the turn of the century, that same fat was mixed with lye and perfume to produce “99 and 44/100 percent pure” Ivory Soap. It’s fair to say Procter & Gambles would never have existed if it weren’t for the meatpackers of Cincinnati. And it wasn’t only Procter & Gambles. By the middle of the 19th Century, dozens of candle manufacturers, soap makers, tanneries, and glue factories were thriving on the effluent stream of all those meatpackers. These are early examples of non-food products in the food industry.

The point of this parable, of course, is to show that the food industry has long been more about industry than food. That’s not all bad. Consider the evolution of the meatpacking industry. Whatever other ethical dilemmas it poses, slaughtering animals has always been ecologically fraught. After all, only a little over a third of a cow is edible meat. Before the industrialization of the food business, much of the rest of the animal—the bones, the blood, the offal—was considered waste and discarded. Farmers, always frugal, tried to use as much of the animal as they could. They might pickle the feet, or use the intestines for sausage casings, or salt the skin to use later as rawhide or leather. But the rest was likely dragged off and buried in a pit.

Because of the filth and stench they produced, slaughterhouses—along with the tanneries and glue factories that depended on them—were usually confined to highly polluted “meatpacking districts.” Blood ran in the streets, and the unsellable parts of the slaughtered animals were often dumped in the river.

The number of non-food products that come out of the meatpacking business today is astounding, incorporating almost every part of the animal. Some are as old as the slaughterhouse.

• Tallow, rendered from the hard fat around the kidneys of cows, has long been used for deep-frying. It’s also a key lubricant in the steel rolling industry

• Hides are processed into leather, gelatin and glue

• Hair is used for upholstery and as an additive for plaster and cement

Other products are new, depending on technological advances in the industry, like steam injected digesters and powerful grinders.

• Hooves and horns are ground up and sold as an additive to animal feed

• Dried blood is added to fertilizer or processed into foams for fire extinguishers and mordants for dying leather

• Bones are burnt to produce activated charcoal for filters or ash for china manufacturing

• Stearic acid and glycerol, key ingredients of thousands of beauty and food products, are byproducts of the soap making process

• Brains, stomachs and gall bladders all are used in pharmaceuticals
