Give It To Me Straight: Is This Thing A Sandwich Or Not?
I’m not here to argue with you. I’m not here to judge what you eat. I’m not here as some sort of food aficionado. And I’m especially not here as someone who was able to spell “aficionado” right on my first try. I’m here to talk about whether or not THIS right here is a sandwich: It has a top. It has a bottom. And, sure as the sun will rise and the sun will set, there’s some filling right between those two beautiful bages. Delicious, delicious goop. The Oxford Living Dictionary defines a sandwich as such: Merriam Webster defines a sandwich like this: And, finally, Urban Dictionary defines a sandwich as such: Fascinating. You can draw your own conclusions from all this. Now, I’m a simple man. I wake up each morning, I set my feet down, I put one foot in front of the other, I flick my ankles, and I still can’t heel-flip. But I need to know your opinion.                                       Give It To Me Straight: Is This Thing A Sandwich Or Not?
