Iskcon Temple In Utah Celebrated The World's Biggest Holi And The Video Will Make You Very Happy If you thought the festival of Holi was only celebrated in India, let's prove you wrong. This year, the world witnessed its biggest celebration of the Indian festival in Utah, USA. Organised by ISKCON every year, Holi is played with great enthusiasm at the Krishna Temple. And it's such a riot of colours, it definitely comes across as a larger-than-life observance - maybe next to our very own that's played in Vrindavan. The following video was shared on Facebook by Bhagavad-gita where devotees and people put on a grand show. The hues fill us with a lot of happy! Holi Hai!
