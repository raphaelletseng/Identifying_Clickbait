Photographing the abandoned: Roman Robroek, Urban Explorer - BBC News


This week's World Update in Pictures takes us to Europe's abandoned places.

Photographer Roman Robroek explores all the places that have been left behind, from little wooden houses, to grand palaces, to control rooms. He captures these forgotten places and shares them on social media.

He told the BBC's Dan Damon how he became interested in the abandoned.
