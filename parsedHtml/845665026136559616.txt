Female cockroaches can reproduce for years without needing a male, scientists find
Common female cockroaches can reproduce for years without needing a mate, producing dozens of generations of all-female descendants, a team of scientists has found. Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction, allowing young insects to spawn from unfertilised eggs. It is the main mode of reproduction for some rarer cockroach species, and also occurs naturally in a range of other invertebrates as well as fish, amphibians, reptiles and even turkeys. In the case of the American cockroach, the largest roach commonly found across the globe, parthenogenesis was previously thought to be an option of last resort. But a team of entomologists at Japan’s Hokkaido University has discovered small, all-female colonies of female roaches are able to reproduce many times without needing a man. “A founder colony of 15 virgin females was sufficient to produce female progeny for a period of more than three years,” the team, headed by Dr Hiroshi Nishino, wrote in their peer-reviewed study .

By examining ancient fossils with an electron microscope, paleobiologist Susannah Porter from UC Santa Barbara discovered tiny holes which may have been drilled by vampiric microbes.

A series of buildings dating back at least 1,600 years were discovered underneath the city's famous Schneller Orphanage which operated on the site from 1860 until the end of the Second World War, when it was turned into an army base.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before      'Male and female brains' aren't real   Brains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but individual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study      Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary divide in North America   A British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west divide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia      Asteroid to skim past Earth on Halloween 2015   A huge asteroid is set to skim by Earth on Halloween, just three weeks after it was first spotted. The rock is travelling through space at 78,000 miles per hour, and will fly past the Earth at a distance of only 300,000 miles – only slightly further away than our moon, and easily close enough for Nasa to class it a potentially hazardous object. The asteroid is bigger than a skyscraper      Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thought   Life may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began "almost instantaneously" after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon's craters      Earth could be at risk of meteor impacts   Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million years      Genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs   Chinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur      Nasa confirms Mars water discovery   Nasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.      Bees in the Rocky Mountains are evolving shorter tongues   With warmer summers, flowers in the Rockies have become shallower and more suited to shorter-tongued bees      The majority of the UK public believe in aliens   The titular alien character from 2011's 'Paul' - a poll has found the majority of the public in Britain, Germany and the US believe that intelligent life is out there in the universe      Researchers discover 'lost world' of arctic dinosaurs   Scientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”      Scientists find exactly what human corpses smell like   New research has become the first to isolate the particular scent of human death, describing the various chemicals that are emitted by corpses in an attempt to help find them in the future.

The researchers hope that the findings are the first step towards working on a synthetic smell that could train cadaver dogs to be able to more accurately find human bodies, or to eventually developing electronic devices that can look for the scent themselves.      The Syrian civil war has caused the first ever withdrawal from the 'doomsday bank'   Researchers in the Middle East have asked for seeds including those of wheat, barley and grasses, all of which are chosen because especially resistant to dry conditions. It is the first withdrawal from the bank, which was built in 2008.

Those researchers would normally request the seeds from a bank in Aleppo. But that centre has been damaged by the war — while some of its functions continue, and its cold storage still works, it has been unable to provide the seeds that are needed by the rest of the Middle East, as it once did.      A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desert   Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.      Academics claim a full bladder makes for a better liar   People lie more convincingly if they have a full bladder, according to research by academics at California State University. Iris Blandón-Gitlin's team asked 22 students to lie to a panel of interviewers. Half were given 700ml to drink before the interview and the other half, just 50ml.

The students with the full bladders showed fewer signs that they were lying and their untrue answers were longer and more detailed, meaning interviewers were less able to detect that they were telling porkies.

PM David Cameron has previously attested to giving speeches on a full bladder.   At one point, there were 1000 descendants of the original batch of roaches thriving in the colony – every single one of them female. Though that number declined to around 200, the entomologists believe their research goes some way toward explaining how roaches can endure in hostile conditions.   Rats and cockroaches among thousands of pests found in NHS hospitals There are 46,000 species of cockroach across the globe, including eight centimetre long specimens found in Australia and even larger varieties in the caves of Central and South America. Some varieties have a 30 centimetre wing-span. They have been around for 200 million years and have evolved a range of survival mechanisms in that time. Roaches can live for weeks without their heads, respiring through their bodies, and survive under water for up to half an hour. Some can cover 80 centimetres in a second, equivalent to a human running at 210 miles an hour. And the latest findings reveal another tool in the roach’s survival arsenal. The scientists stated: “in the short term, especially in the presence of abundant resources, parthenogenesis can be a useful strategy for rapidly generating large numbers of female progeny and colonis[ing] new habitats.” More about: Cockroaches Science Japan Insects Comments
