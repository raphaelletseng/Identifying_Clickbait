Soulja Boy Appears to Get Robbed in Wild IG Live Video, Chris Brown and Twitter React
It’s been a bad 2017 for Soulja Boy . And 2017 is only a few days old. Just a day after he began beefing with Chris Brown , the Chicago rapper went to Instagram to share a live broadcast with his followers. And it didn’t seem to end well for the controversial artist. During the broadcast, we see Soulja approach an individual yelling, “What’s going on, man? They say Soulja Boy ain’t from the hood,” before putting his arm around the unidentified guy. The man then pushes Soulja away saying, “Get off me, though”; the phone drops, another dude picks the phone up, and then the broadcast ends.
