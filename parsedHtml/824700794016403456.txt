These Kids' Drawings Are Being Turned Into Amazing Anime
Thomas Romain is an animator based in Tokyo, Japan with his two sons. He’s worked on anime such as Macross Delta and Space Dandy, and created work for games studios. Romain told BuzzFeed News that he noticed his sons producing fun, creative drawings just before Christmas. Inspired and wanting to get back into drawing with pencils and watercolor, he decided to turn one of their doodles into an illustration. 原案:息子
