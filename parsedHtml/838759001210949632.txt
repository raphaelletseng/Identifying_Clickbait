Julius Peppers has terrorized NFL quarterbacks for 15 seasons and decided Monday to return for another.

Agent Carl Carey told Rob Demovsky and Vaughn McClure of ESPN.com of Peppers' decision. He is currently a free agent, having spent the last three seasons in Green Bay.

The 37-year-old entered the league as the No. 2 overall pick in the 2002 draft and has played for the Carolina Panthers, Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers. He posted 7.5 sacks last season and has 143.5 for his career.

Peppers' announcement comes after Ryan Wood of USA Today reported in December the outside linebacker was considering retirement after his three-year, $26 million deal with Green Bay ended.

"I'm not saying that I don't want to play next year," Peppers said. "I'm not saying that I do. I'm just saying that right now, I don't know. And I'll figure it out at some point."

The Packers lessened Peppers' load during the season, although he was forced into a larger role at times due to injuries. He moved into fifth place, ahead of Michael Strahan, on the all-time sacks list in 2016 with a takedown of Houston Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler.

It was another notch on Peppers' incredible resume that includes nearly everything but a Super Bowl ring. He is a nine-time Pro Bowler, Defensive Rookie of the Year and three-time first-team All-Pro.

His durability has always stood out:
