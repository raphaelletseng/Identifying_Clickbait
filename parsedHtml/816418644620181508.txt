Forbes Names Lil Yachty, Desiigner, and Others in 2017 "30 Under 30" List


Earlier today, Forbes shared their annual 30 Under 30 list, the "most definitive gathering of todayâ€™s leading young change-makers and innovators in the U.S." Honoring 600 individuals across 20 categories, including Art & Style, Education, Food & Drink, and Music, it shines a light on young Americans and their "extraordinary achievements."

Unsurprisingly, Forbes' music category features some of the most talented artists in the game right now. Included in the publication's list are rap's two favorite 19-year-olds, Lil Yachty and Desiigner, both of whom saw tremendous success in 2016 and the former earning a Grammy nomination. Alessia Cara (20), Gallant (25), and Bibi Bourelly (22) are also honored on the list having released critically acclaimed projects over the last year. Jeremih, who turns 30 next year, also makes the Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in time.

Congratulations to all the honorees and take a look the rest of the music category, as well as the entirety of Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, via their site.
