Demi Lovato Says She's 1 Percent African -- And Twitter Absolutely Loses It
Demi Lovato Says She's 1 Percent African -- And Twitter Absolutely Loses It
So much for wanting to share some personal news. Pop star Demi Lovato was hit by a firestorm of haters on Twitter after sharing the results of a DNA ancestry test on Friday. Lovato, 24, revealed that she’s mostly Spanish, with Native American, Scandinavian, Irish and British roots. She also said she’s 1 percent African. I did a DNA test and found out I'm mainly Spanish, with Native American, SCANDINAVIAN (which I had NO idea), Irish, BRITISH.... And I'm 1% African!!!! Lovato’s clear excitement was perhaps expected, since she’s been outspoken about her love of Africa. After celebrating her 21st birthday by volunteering with a children’s charity in Kenya , she got a tattoo of the continent on her arm. “I went to Kenya and it was just a very, very inspirational journey that I feel like really had a huge impact on my life,” she told iHeart radio while discussing her ink. “I would’ve gotten Kenya but then people would have been like, ‘What’s that?’ So Africa’s a little more distinct.” Her test results were not well received. @ddlovato  pic.twitter.com/o7fUCvw9dC @Flawless_Demi_  @ddlovato everybody is at least 1% African but you don't see everyone running around with tattoos of Africa @ddlovato  pic.twitter.com/e30HiLoPtE @ddlovato  pic.twitter.com/LJTqv7ux3K . @greylovxto  @upallnightpayno  @ddlovato If anyone has trouble understanding this it's from mean girls pic.twitter.com/wXFfbwft2Z @ddlovato  pic.twitter.com/AoowvBFdL4 The “Confident” singer’s mood went from excited to downcast in a matter of minutes. In a follow-up Tweet, she called out some of her haters for being “mean [as f**k].” Just thought it was cool and totally random. Some of y'all are mean af. Twitter sucks. 😔 Fortunately, there were plenty of others who embraced her Lovato’s news. @ddlovato Gurl don't let it bother you. You did nothing wrong. Knowing your ancestry is an amazing thing.

Lovato’s clear excitement was perhaps expected, since she’s been outspoken about her love of Africa. After celebrating her 21st birthday by volunteering with a children’s charity in Kenya, she got a tattoo of the continent on her arm.

“I went to Kenya and it was just a very, very inspirational journey that I feel like really had a huge impact on my life,” she told iHeart radio while discussing her ink. “I would’ve gotten Kenya but then people would have been like, ‘What’s that?’ So Africa’s a little more distinct.”

Her test results were not well received.
