An Israeli policeman has been suspended after a video emerged on social media showing him assaulting a Palestinian truck driver in an alleged row over parking.

The policeman was filmed on a dash camera shouting at the driver, in Wadi Jozi, an Arab area in occupied East Jerusalem, before headbutting and kicking him.

People can be seen apparently trying to reason with the policeman, in the widely shared clip, before he turns on them.

The Israeli police force said the officer was being investigated and had been placed on forced leave.

The video was recorded by a Palestinian resident and has been shared hundreds of times on social media.

A Palestinian witness filmed the incident, which took place in a parking lot near the interior ministry and handed a copy to a journalist with Israeli public radio, the station reported.

The witness said the policeman had accused the driver of having damaged his car with the truck.

The police force swiftly condemned the attack and said in a statement that the policeman was immediately suspended and 'summoned for a talk on his future in the police'.

Israeli politician and public security minister Gilad Erdan condemned the incident, calling it 'very serious and shameful' and damaging to the whole police force.
