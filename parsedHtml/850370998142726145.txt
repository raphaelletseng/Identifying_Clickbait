This is officially the last time I ever share food with my son. My house would be a lot cleaner if my family didn't live here. I wish I was a little bit taller I wish I was a baller I wish I had a kid that would listen when I called her. - if moms wrote rap music I'm not sure what my kids did in this room, but based on the debris pattern I'd say they ritually sacrificed a chocolate doughnut. Sometimes I feel completely alone in this world. Other times, I can't stop to pee without a toddler coming in, and trying to brush my teeth. Most of being a good parent is just trying to be an average parent despite being incredibly tired. I've been married to my husband for a decade & never heard him order straight whiskey at dinner until our road trip with 3 kids. "Just once," she thought dejectedly, "I'd like to enjoy a shower where I'm not gazing at an old, moldy-looking bath toy." BREAKING: Everything my kids touch.

My 6yo got herself dressed then walked around the house making us all sign a paper agreeing that her outfit looked good. My 5yo was told "no" by my partner. She came to me smiling & whispered "dad, want to pretend to be the boss of the house for a few minutes?" 1st child: you encourage creativity 2nd child: you encourage independent play 3rd child: you stifle all imagination to avoid a mess. Took me 5 seconds to forget the name my kid just gave his stuffed animal. Which is impressive because he told it to me like 7 or 18 times. Love it when the kids pick up 90s slang from me. My 5-year-old just told the baby to “chillax.” Just took out a small loan to outfit my kid for little league. ALSO ON HUFFPOST Cute Kid Notes       Share this slide:       MORE:
