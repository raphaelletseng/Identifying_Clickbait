LOS ANGELES -- The Chargers' first public presentation in their new city didn't go over so well Saturday.

During Saturday's game against the Lakers, the Clippers showed the new Los Angeles Chargers logo on the video screen, and the Staples Center crowd promptly booed.

After a few seconds, the screen cut to Chargers tight end Jeff Cumberland, who briefly waved but was also booed.

Chargers CEO and president Dean Spanos announced Thursday that the team would move to Los Angeles after 56 seasons in San Diego. The team will play home games the next two seasons at the 30,000-seat StubHub Center in Carson, California.
