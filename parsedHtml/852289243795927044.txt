The combined following of the 30 social media stars featured is 250 million. According to the report created with social insight platform Captiv8 and influencer analytics firm Traackr, if they have seven million subscribers or more on YouTube, vloggers could make up to $300,000 per post for a video partnership. Additionally, top influencers could make $187,000 per Facebook post, and $150,000 per Instagram post.
