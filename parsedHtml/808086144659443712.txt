14 great memes that came out of the hellhole that was 2016
The memes of 2016 reflect a year filled with a lot of ... errrr ... . There was crying, anger and a frog riding a unicycle.

From athletes making surprising facial expressions to cartoons from our childhood resurfacing to Joe Biden playing pranks on Donald Trump, this has been a year to remember (or hopefully forget with the right amount of therapy) for the internet. Behold, the year in internet memes.

The memes of 2016 reflect a year filled with a lot of ... errrr ... feelings.

There was crying, anger and a frog riding a unicycle.

And in the weirdest year yet of the 21st century, funny stuff on the internet just might have been 2016's saving grace. So we're taking a look back at the dopest memes of the past 12 months.

From athletes making surprising facial expressions to cartoons from our childhood resurfacing to Joe Biden playing pranks on Donald Trump, this has been a year to remember (or hopefully forget with the right amount of therapy) for the internet.
