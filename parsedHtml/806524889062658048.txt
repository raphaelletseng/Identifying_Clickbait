Dale Cavese: the football chant that took over the internet and the world

Copa90                                               s football stories take on a viral nature, chants and melodies are carrying like never before, becoming internet trends like dabbing and the mannequin challenge. Fans’ chants are travelling like never before. Will Grigg’s on Fire defined the summer more than David Guetta’s official Euro 2016 choice, This One’s For You , but no song has spread across the planet like Dale Cavese, the first football chant to gain global popularity through the internet. The tune has made the small Italian club SS Cavese 1919 world famous; previously they were best known for a three-year stint in Serie B in the early 1980s. The melody comes the song Moliendo Café , which was written in Venezuela in 1958. It has been reinterpreted in many languages, but found its biggest audience when revived by Julio Iglesias in 1976 . A few years later, the song became staple for Boca Juniors fans at the La Bombonera, where it would remain almost exclusively for three decades, until, through a series of coincidences, it appeared in Italy. When the original YouTube video was uploaded in April 2007 , the website was still in its infancy. Yet somehow, through the power of fan forums and social media, it found popularity across the globe. The Argentinian version, Dale Boca (Come on Boca), took on drums and trumpets, which are not allowed in Italian stadiums for cultural and security reasons. This song has since evolved in different parts of the world. Besiktas do it as a call and response, and Aris Thessaloniki and Montpellier have given the song lyrics. The simple melody and its global popularity as a pop song in the 1960s and 1970s has made it beloved by all. Its growth as an internet phenomenon tells us something about how fan culture is developing today. 1) Italy  2) San Jose Earthquakes, USA  3) Zamalek, Egypt 4) Western Sydney, Australia 5) Ajax, Holland 6) Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen, Belgium 7) Besiktas, Turkey 8) Iraklis, Greece 9) Stevenage, England 10) Rangers, Scotland  11) Swansea City, Wales 12) Real Madrid, Spain 13) Mainz, Germany 14) Trepca 89, Kosovo 15) Dynamo Kyiv, Ukraine 16) Lille, France 17) Persib, Indonesia 18) Consadole Sapporo, Japan  19) Clube de Remo, Brazil 20) Tigres, Mexico 21) Peñarol, Uruguay 22) AIK, Sweden 23) Club Universidad de Chile, Chile 24) América de Cali, Colombia 25) Petrolul Ploiesti, Romania 26) Górnik Zabrze, Poland 27) SV Austria Salzburg, Austria 28) San Lorenzo, Argentina 29) Olimpia, Paraguay 30) St Patrick’s Athletic, Ireland Topics  YouTube
