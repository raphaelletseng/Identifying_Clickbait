More than 44,000 volunteers braved cold temperatures and freezing rain to set hundreds of thousands of donated wreaths at headstones at Arlington National Cemetery.

The Wreaths Across America project has become an annual tradition at Arlington. It began in 1992 when a Maine wreathmaker donated 5,000 surplus wreaths to the cemetery.

Project spokeswoman Amber Caron said more than 44,000 volunteers helped lay 245,000 wreaths at Arlington on Saturday. The Maine-made wreaths arrived from the Pine Tree State via motorcade.

Caron says 1.2 million wreaths were placed at nearly 1,230 participating locations across the country.
