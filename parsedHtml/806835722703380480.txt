Being the youngest in your family officially makes you funnier
Being the youngest in your family officially makes you funnier


Do you have a younger sibling who you are convinced everyone treats loads better than you?

Well, we might have discovered why. It’s because they are the funniest and most laid back in the family.

A YouGov study spoke to siblings, asking them to rate their personality traits alongside those of their brothers and sisters, and found out that birth order really does shape your personality. And it does so in exactly the way that you would think. The youngest child tends to be funnier, and more easy-going, whereas the oldest child has a bigger sense of responsibility and is more family-orientated.





The study revealed:

The most significant difference is in feeling the burden of responsibility – most (54%) first borns say they are more responsible than their siblings, compared to 31% of last borns. Younger siblings, on the other hand, are more likely to say they are more funny (46% compared to 36% of elder siblings), more easy going and more relaxed.

It makes sense really. As the older child, you want to keep an eye out for your younger brother or sister. And for the youngest? Well, everyone loves spoiling the baby.
