It depicts police officers as pigs and won a congressional art competition

Washington (CNN) A high school student's painting that evoked a national controversy earlier this week will be taken down after it was officially deemed to violate the House Office Building Commission's rules, according to a congressman who objected to the artwork.

Rep. Dave Reichert had sent a letter to the Architect of the Capitol with his concerns about the painting, which depicts police officers as pigs.

This photo shows the painting by high school student David Pulphus.

House Speaker Paul Ryan also took a stand against the art, which hanged in a tunnel at the US Capitol, calling it "disgusting."

Friday, Reichert said Ryan's office informed him the painting will be taken down after the federal holiday.

The painting won Democratic Rep. William Lacy Clay's congressional art competition in May and was created by 18-year-old David Pulphus.
