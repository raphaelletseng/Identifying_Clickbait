On Thursday, the company, which was founded in the 1920s, announced plans to build its first production facility in "America's Dairyland," the great state of Wisconsin.

Haribo spans more than 25 countries worldwide, and though it opened its first U.S. sales office in Baltimore, Maryland back in 1982, this is the first U.S. factory. The only catch? We'll have to wait a few more years before the confections are officially "Made in the U.S."

"Haribo of America is the fastest-growing candymaker in the United States. That is why the step to start with local production from 2020 is important to us," Haribo's managing partner, Hans Guido Riegel, told Fortune.
