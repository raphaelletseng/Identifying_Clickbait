ISIS amputate hands of boys in front of families in Mosul
ISIS chop off hands of boys, 10 and 12, for not executing prisoners


ISIS have amputated the hands of two boys aged ten and 12 who refused to execute two civilians in front of their families in Mosul.

Fanatics trained up a group of children from its stronghold in western parts of the city to fight against advancing Iraqi troops.

But two of the youngsters refused to carry out the twisted demands of their terror bosses.

The youngsters were severely punished for refusing to execute two prisoners in front of their families.

According to Iraqi News, they both had a hand chopped off by extremists.

Public amputations are a common punishment under the terror group's murderous regime, but the brutal punishment is normally reserved for people accused of theft.

ISIS leaders are resorting to increasingly desperate tactics as they continue to lose territory in Mosul.

Pictures recently emerged of crude home-made car bombs, with scrap metal used as armour to protect them from bullets.

Faced with a diminishing number of fighters, ISIS is also relying on retrofitted commercial drones to guide suicide car bombers to their targets and to launch small-scale airstrikes on Iraqi forces.

The extremist group is spending freely on drone technology as it faces pressure from coalition forces, hacking store-bought machines, applying rigorous testing protocols and mimicking tactics used by U.S. unmanned aircraft.
