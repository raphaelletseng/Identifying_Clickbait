Prior to her stardom, though, VanderWaal spent time covering other artists’ songs while developing her own skills as a lyricist and a musician. As the youngster heads into the teenage years (she turns 13 today, Jan. 15), we wanted to celebrate the talent VanderWaal has -- even when she's not singing her own tunes.  Check out VanderWaal’s best covers below. Perhaps the most fitting song for VanderWaal's hoarse sound, her ukulele take on Elle King 's raspy toe-tapper almost sounds like one of her own songs. Once again proving her artistry at such a young age, VanderWaal stripped down Meghan Trainor 's booty-shaking pop hit, which really showed off her range of dynamics -- especially with big belts in the chorus. Vance Joy 's acoustic-based tune is perfect for VanderWaal's ukulele, but almost even more perfectly for her soulful tone. Before anyone even knew VanderWaal as 's Season 11 prodigy, she delivered a roaring rendition of the Florence & The Machine track that ended with quite the vocal vigor. There's not many 12-year-olds who dare to take on a Sia song (or anyone, for that matter), but VanderWaal wasn't afraid -- and it turned out quite nicely for her. The lighthearted ukulele helps emphasize VanderWaal's bouncy vocals on this sassy Bridgit Mendler tune. VanderWaal's rendition of this deep cut proves her Jason Mraz fandom. Another favorite artist of VanderWaal's is Twenty One Pilots , and this upbeat rock tune actually sounds somewhat reminiscent of her original "I Don't Know My Name." Despite the fact that Christina Perri 's breakup song is more of a ballad, VanderWaal held nothing back in her cover of the track, really making it her own in some spots (i.e., the 1:30 mark). VanderWaal's soft voice croons Melanie Martinez 's eerily edgy song in a way that makes the rather depressing lyrics almost endearing.  FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS

As the youngster heads into the teenage years (she turns 13 today, Jan. 15), we wanted to celebrate the talent VanderWaal has -- even when she's not singing her own tunes.

Check out VanderWaal’s best covers below.

"Ex’s & Oh’s"

Perhaps the most fitting song for VanderWaal's hoarse sound, her ukulele take on Elle King's raspy toe-tapper almost sounds like one of her own songs.

"All About That Bass"

Once again proving her artistry at such a young age, VanderWaal stripped down Meghan Trainor's booty-shaking pop hit, which really showed off her range of dynamics -- especially with big belts in the chorus.

"Riptide"

Vance Joy's acoustic-based tune is perfect for VanderWaal's ukulele, but almost even more perfectly for her soulful tone.

"Dog Days"

Before anyone even knew VanderWaal as AGT 's Season 11 prodigy, she delivered a roaring rendition of the Florence & The Machine track that ended with quite the vocal vigor.

"Breathe Me"

There's not many 12-year-olds who dare to take on a Sia song (or anyone, for that matter), but VanderWaal wasn't afraid -- and it turned out quite nicely for her.

"Ready or Not"

The lighthearted ukulele helps emphasize VanderWaal's bouncy vocals on this sassy Bridgit Mendler tune.

"Back to the Earth"

VanderWaal's rendition of this deep cut proves her Jason Mraz fandom.

"House of Gold"

Another favorite artist of VanderWaal's is Twenty One Pilots, and this upbeat rock tune actually sounds somewhat reminiscent of her original "I Don't Know My Name."

"Jar of Hearts"

Despite the fact that Christina Perri's breakup song is more of a ballad, VanderWaal held nothing back in her cover of the track, really making it her own in some spots (i.e., the 1:30 mark).

"Pity Party"

VanderWaal's soft voice croons Melanie Martinez's eerily edgy song in a way that makes the rather depressing lyrics almost endearing.
