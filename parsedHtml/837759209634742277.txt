Mike Fisher of Scout.com reported the Denver Broncos are expected to "go hard after" Romo if the Cowboys release him.

The Rams finished a disappointing 4-12 in 2016, missing the playoffs for the 12th straight season. Goff was the No. 1 overall pick in last year's draft, though he struggled with five touchdowns, seven interceptions and a completion percentage of 54.6 in eight games (seven starts).

Sean McVay is entering his first season as Rams head coach. He won't be under immense pressure to win right away, but Goff's development in 2017 will go a long way toward dictating when this franchise returns to relevance in the NFC West.
