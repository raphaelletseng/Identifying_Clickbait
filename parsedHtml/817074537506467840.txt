Former Goldman Sachs CEO and New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine has agreed to pay $5 million to the Commodity Futures Trading CommissionÂ to settle a lawsuit over the 2011 collapse of his hedge fund,Â MF Global.

That's according to Reuters,Â which reports that Corzine has also agreed to never again register with the CFTC.

Corzine was the CEO of Goldman Sachs from 1994-1999. He was a US Senator from New Jersey from 2001 to 2006 andÂ New Jersey governor from 2006-2010.Â

He wasÂ chairman and CEO of MF Global, technically a futures brokerage,Â from March 2010 until its bankruptcy in the fall of 2011.Â The CFTC filed civil charges against Corzine for using money from customer accounts for corporate purposes, according to Market Watch.

In spring 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that Corzine was considering starting a hedge fund with his own money and money fromÂ a small group of outside investors.Â
