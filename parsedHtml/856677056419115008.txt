Serena Williams is currently going through one of the happiest moments of her life. She announced her engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in late December. Four months later, she revealed on Snapchat that she and Ohanian were expecting their first child. When she won the Australian Open and set a new record for most Grand Slam titles with 23, Williams regained the No. 1 spot in the women's division. So, can someone explain why would anyone want to rain on her parade? Well, let's ask Ilie Nastase.

ESPN is reporting that Nastase, a former U.S. Open and French Open singles champion, was heard saying, "Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?," when discussing Serena's baby. Earlier today, Williams responded to Nastase's remarks on Instagram.

"It disappoints me to know that we live in a society where people like Ilie Nastase can make such racist comments towards myself and unborn child, and sexist comments against my peers,” Williams wrote. Serena even borrowed some words from Maya Angelou’s poem "Still I Rise" in her response. "Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom?" she wrote. "You may shoot me with your words...you may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I’ll rise."

Nastase is currently under investigation for her comments, and could face disciplinary action from the International Tennis Federation.
