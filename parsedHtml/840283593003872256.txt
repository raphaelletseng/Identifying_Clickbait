Billy Ray Cyrus Is Hinting That Miley And Liam Secretly Got Married
The internet went into a frenzy Thursday night after Billy Ray Cyrus tweeted and Instagramed a picture of Miley wearing a white dress with the cryptic caption, “I’m so happy…you are happy.” I'm so happy...you are happy @MileyCyrus. Billy Ray’s Twitter mentions immediately FLOODED with Miley fans asking if the sentimental caption paired with picture meant Miley and Liam Hemsworth had finally tied the knot: @billyraycyrus Okay Billy, let's communicate.
RT for wedding
Like for music video
RT & Like for just a regular photo(shoot) @billyraycyrus @MileyCyrus DID MILEY GET MARRIED @billyraycyrus @MileyCyrus Is she now Mrs. Hemsworth? Though Miley and Liam haven’t said anything about the picture, Billy retweeted a couple ~wedding tweets~, which would be misleading if Miley and Liam DIDN’T actually get married: If you need a little refresher on your Miley and Liam history, the pair met in 2010 while filming , got engaged in 2012, split in 2013, got BACK together in late 2015, then Miley basically confirmed their engagement was back on while visiting in October: And let’s be real, this WOULD BE what a Miley Cyrus wedding dress would look like: PLEASE LET MILEY CYRUS-HEMSWORTH BE A REAL THING.
