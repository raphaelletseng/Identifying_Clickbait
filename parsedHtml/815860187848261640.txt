Robbie Williams caught using hand sanitiser after greeting fans on New Year's Eve
obbie Williams has been mocked online after looking less-than-impressed after greeting fans, using hand sanitiser live on air while grimacing. The singerÂ jumped into the crowd to performÂ Auld Lang Syne during an intimateÂ gig at Westminster's Central Hall. However, he appeared to regret doing so, looking disgusted and washing his hands immediately after. Some thought his exaggerated expression meant he could be joking. Others disagreed, concluding from his actions that he did not enjoy the close encounter with his fans.

The year of memes commences pic.twitter.com/zXb3c3Dyp5 he new year began with a strange performance by Mariah Carey in New York. The singer, 46, took to the stage in New Yorkâ€™s Times Square but technical difficulties marred the event which was one of the biggest planned to ring in 2017. At the end of her performance, watched byÂ millions of fans,Â Carey abruptly walked off stage and signed off with: "It just don't get any better." he had told the crowd: "I'm trying to be a good sport here." Carey stopped singing her song Emotions, paced the stage and told the audience to finish the lyrics for her. "We can't hear. We didn't have a check for this song... we're missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is," she said. Then, appearing to give up attempting to lip sync, she said: "I'm going to say let the audience sing, okay?" She added: "I wanted a holiday too, can I not have one?" Viewers were unimpressed with the performance, and the video of the singer's abrupt exit made the rounds on social media. Â
