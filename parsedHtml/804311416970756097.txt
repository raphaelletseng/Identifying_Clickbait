8 Things You Must Do Right Now To Retire As A Billionaire Here's a sneak peek into the life of famous billionaire Mark Zuckerberg: He is the world’s fifth-richest person with a net worth estimated to be $56.7 billion. He owns a $7 million Palo Alto mansion spread over 5,617 square feet, at least four swanky supercars, and plans to build a palace on the 750-acre tract he picked up on the beautiful Hawaiian island of Kauai for $100 million two years ago. This is the life of a billionaire, and of course, everyone wants to own that life. Who wouldn't mind a couple of swanky cars, a huge bungalow, a large farmhouse for vacations, and of course, money to buy just about anything you keep your hands on? Well, you may not have everything today that Zuckerberg has at the age of 31, but there are some simple things you can do right now to build your own cool list of swanky possessions over time! Here are some tips and notes that can help you plan smart while you are still young and can take you a long way ahead if you really want to get rich: 1. Be wise and keep a track on your spends. Often, we spend money on things we may not even use. So, be gentle on the wallet before you make any transaction and check how you can be more efficient in managing your expenses. 2. Always keep an emergency fund handy. Saving money can prove to be your biggest asset. Creating a separate account where you deposit a fixed amount of money every month can be a really good idea. This is your liquid cash which will come to your rescue if you face any sort of contingencies. 3. Invest smartly. Keeping all your money in one place, and that too, idle, may not prove to be fruitful. You could try to invest in a smart mix of stocks and bonds, or even better, in mutual funds - which give access to a variety of stocks and bonds. This will not just prove profitable, but help you save on taxes too. Did you know equity funds give you completely tax-free returns after one year? Awesome, right! By your late 20s, you should aim to set aside some money just to make these investments. 4. With every salary hike, maximize investments and control expenditure. It is a normal human tendency to shell out more money for entertainment post a salary hike. But, remember that you are using the extra money efficiently only when your investments are increasing proportionately, not your expenditure. 5. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. We all know how true this is, and we practice this in almost everything we do. Similarly, when it comes to using your money to invest, make sure you buy different types products for different needs. For example- Mutual funds to create a lot of wealth; Insurance to be protected in case of unforeseen circumstances; A small bank balance (or the new and modern liquid funds) to manage regular expenses and so on and so forth. After all, when you won’t go to the same restaurant or resto-bar every day, apply the same principle to your money as well! 6. Don’t just try to cut expenses, instead, find ways to make more money. If you are constantly thinking of new ways to earn, you won’t have to live like a miser. Take up a freelancing gig and stash that money aside as your savings. Take some risk, as the other side of well managed risk is more money! 7. Get professional advice. Before taking big investment decisions, it won’t harm you to take professional consultation with expert financial advisors. They know the plans that will suit you best so that you can stock and plan enough finances to have a rich post-retirement life. 8. Investing money is an art, learn it.
