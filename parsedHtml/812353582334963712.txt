You don’t have to travel far on the Internet to find average salaries in our own industry and even country, but it’s less common to see how your homeland stacks up against its global neighbors. HR consulting firm Universum recently released its annual list of the countries with the highest salary expectations. It surveyed 580,397 business and engineering students from 57 countries and asked what salary they expect in their first year after graduation.

This list doesn’t factor in cost of living, which is typically lower in places with lower salary expectations, and it doesn’t include all countries. But it covers a wide cross-section of nations and gives us insights into their economies. All numbers were converted to U.S. dollars, represent averages and are ranked based on expectations among business students.

For the top 10 countries with the highest salary expectations, view the gallery below. See the end of this post for the bottom 10.

Switzerland, with average entry-level salary expectations of about $79,000, topped the list. The country has the second-highest per-capita GDP in the world after tiny Luxembourg, according to the World Bank, and ranks 16th on FORBES’ list of the best countries for business. A strong service sector leads Switzerland’s economy, with financial services at the forefront. The manufacturing of high-tech goods also plays a major role in driving national income.

After Denmark, the U.S. ranked third in salary expectations. American business students expect $53,000 in their first year out of school and engineering students expect $63,000. Among all 57 countries in the survey, the U.S. had the widest gap in pay expectations between business and engineering students, a dynamic perhaps driven by the high-flying U.S. tech companies where engineers are in high demand and short supply.

Germany had the fifth highest salary expectations, ranging from $47,000 to $49,000 among business and engineering students. With an export-heavy economy, the country sells many vehicles and industrial machines. Germany is often praised for its vocational education programs, which have helped it build a skilled labor force.

Near the bottom of the list, Russia had the ninth-lowest salary expectations, ranging from about $9,000 to $10,000. After the Cold War, the country began moving slowly toward a free-market system—economic policy changes in the 1990s privatized most industry, with exceptions like energy and banking. Its economy remains largely dependent on oil and natural gas, making it vulnerable to commodities price swings. Income inequality remains high.

Vietnam had the lowest pay expectations among all surveyed nations, with students expecting to make $6,000. As of 2014, agriculture comprised 18% of its economy, and government-owned businesses made up 40% of GDP. But its economy is growing. Last year it expanded 7%, and this year it expects the same.
