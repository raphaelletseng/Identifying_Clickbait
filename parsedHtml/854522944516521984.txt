19 Hilarious Tweets About Coachella That Will Make You Actually LOL
The worst part about Coachella is Coachella    do Vanessa hudgens and Austin butler just like hibernate and then crawl out of their little cave once a year for coachella or what    No one actually cares about Coachella we just wait to see what Vanessa Hudgens is wearing every year    Your Coachella outfit is appropriating 100% of a Native American headdress for someone who claims to be 2% Choctaw.    me at everyone at Coachella    coachella is jus a sea of rich hot people swaying    Sooooo? How was Coachella? Did you do drugs?    "ASHLEY CLOSE THE PORTAPOTTY MY TITS ARE OUT" is the best thing i overheard at coachella these are the memories the chainsmokers sing about    coachella in 4 pictures    More people attended Lady Gaga's Coachella concert than Donald Trump's inauguration    We get it your at Coachella    I wish people would post their Coachella photos.    i got grinded on but like, ironically at the hans zimmer coachella set    Who needs Coachella when you can have COUCHella. Where you just sit on your couch and eat poptarts while watching old movies    Greetings from Molly! I just took some Coachella    fav part of coachella is walking by people making their friend take a photo of them looking at the ground pretending 2 be introspective    imagine going to the effort of resurrecting and then havin to share ur special day with coachella    Maybe your Coachella outfit today should be your sunday best you pagan scum    ME ON THE PHONE TRYING 2 MEET WITH MY FRIEND AT COACHELLA
