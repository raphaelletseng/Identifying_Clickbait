Tesco spokesperson confirmed: “We do not have a formal dress code in our stores and colleagues use their common sense and discretion when speaking to customers about this issue." So-called "all-day pyjama syndrome" is widely seen as a growing social and sartorial problem in the UK.

Asda said customers could wear anything they wanted as long as they wore something. A spokesman said, “So long as they’re not in their birthday suits we tend to leave outfit choice up to our customers. After all, life’s one big catwalk!” A Waitrose spokeswoman said: "Everyone is welcome to shop in Waitrose. If our customers want to come shopping in their PJs and dressing gowns that's fine by us."

Back in 2010 a Cardiff branch of Tesco launched a fully fledged pyjama ban after customers complained about people shopping in nightwear. Signs were put up in the window headed Tesco Dress Code Police, asking customers to be "appropriately dressed" when visiting the store. It added: "Footwear must be worn at all times and no nightwear is permitted".
