Twitter apologizes for mistakes around @POTUS account
Twitter apologizes for mistakes around @POTUS account
There was a mistake made on Inauguration Day. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologized Saturday for accidentally making it so that Twitter users followed @POTUS and other administrative accounts even when they tried not to. It was a complex ordeal during which Twitter told on Friday, following reports of users saying that they were automatically following @POTUS under Trump even when they were not before or had unfollowed prior to Inauguration ( as Twitter outlined they could do ), that there was no glitch.

Dorsey explained the situation in a series of tweets Saturday, which are all below. TLDR: If you followed @POTUS44 (Obama's archived tweets) after 12 p.m. ET Friday you were automatically set to follow @POTUS (Trump), and some accounts were mistakenly marked in the system to follow @POTUS despite previously unfollowing the account.

There was a mistake made on Inauguration Day.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologized Saturday for accidentally making it so that Twitter users followed @POTUS and other administrative accounts even when they tried not to.

It was a complex ordeal during which Twitter told Mashable on Friday, following reports of users saying that they were automatically following @POTUS under Trump even when they were not before or had unfollowed prior to Inauguration (as Twitter outlined they could do), that there was no glitch.

That is still true, in part. But Twitter engineers orchestrated settings that violated what they had said to do.

TLDR: If you followed @POTUS44 (Obama's archived tweets) after 12 p.m. ET Friday you were automatically set to follow @POTUS (Trump), and some accounts were mistakenly marked in the system to follow @POTUS despite previously unfollowing the account.

If you were following @POTUS before 12pET, by end of day you'd be following *two* accounts: @POTUS44 (44th Admin) and @POTUS (45th Admin) — jack (@jack) January 21, 2017
