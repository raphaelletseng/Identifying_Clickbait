This Guy Had The Best Passive Aggressive Response To His Dirty Roommate
My passive-aggressive art gallery is thriving, although some critics don't care for my emphasis on found pieces.                                                                                                      @justincousson In total, the installation contains more than 30 pieces spanning the living room, kitchen and laundry "I live in a house with three roommates, a cat, and one man child we're all a bit tired of cleaning up after," he said. "I started taking pictures of the messes, adding pretentious titles, and when it happened pretty much daily I ended up with a large collection."   @justincousson I must inform you that reports the exhibition is complete are, in fact, inaccurate.   @justincousson Reminder: Great art appreciates with time. "I love that [the project] has resonated with so many people around the world," said Cousson. "Even if now they consistently send me pictures of trash for appraisal."   "Something about this clearly appeals to peoples' appetite for the most mild form of vigilante justice," he said. Brad Esposito is a news reporter for BuzzFeed and is based in Sydney, Australia.
