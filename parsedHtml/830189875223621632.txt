They challenge me, they inspire me, and they make me a better person! Though we don’t see each other as often as we would like, it is always like we have never been apart and I couldn’t be more thankful!!! I love these two beyond words and have to say that after a few hours together today my heart is full!” WHEN I SEE THEIR HAPPY FACES SMILING BACK AT ME. I KNOW THERE’S NO GREATER FEELING THAN THE LOVE OF FAMILY. More of this, please.   May The Beyhive Have Mercy On Karlie Kloss Because...
