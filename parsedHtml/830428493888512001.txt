Katy Perry's 'Chained to the Rhythm' is cotton candy political pop
"Chained to the Rhythm" is a new kind of Katy Perry song, certainly. "Are we tone deaf / Keep sweeping it under the mat / Thought we could do better than that / I hope we can," Perry sings. "So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble / So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble." Still, the song's lyric video features a very cute hamster, eating tiny versions of people food, because this is still the girl behind "Last Friday Night."
