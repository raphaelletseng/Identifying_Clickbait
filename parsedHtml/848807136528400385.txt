Dramatic moment plane lands on MOTORWAY in Barcelona


This dramatic video shows the moment a plane lands on a motorway after developing an engine fault.

The plane developed an engine fault after taking off from Sabadell Airport in Barcelona.

It made an emergency landing on a busy motorway on the outskirts of Barcelona.

The four-seater ultralight landed on the AP-7 between Cardedeu and Llinars del Vallès

The incident happened yesterday afternoon after the plane had taken off from Sabadell Airport

Thanks to the skill of the pilot, he managed to land on a slip road and avoided the main traffic.

The incident happened yesterday afternoon and brought the emergency services to the scene, fearing the worst.

But miraculously, no-one was hurt and no damage was suffered.

The four-seater ultralight landed on the AP-7 between Cardedeu and Llinars del Vallès.

Police said two experienced pilots were on board who decided to make the emergency landing when they detected some sort of technical error.

'The expertise of the ultralight pilot meant it avoided landing directly on the highway and, therefore, did not affect the traffic and there were no injuries,' said a spokesman for the Catalan traffic service.

Fuel was removed from the plane before it was dismantled and taken back to the airport.
