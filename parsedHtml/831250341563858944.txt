Here’s Everything We Know About Trump’s Mexico Wall


One possibility is that U.S. taxpayers would pay for it, and Congress would try to recoup the cost from Mexico.

While the U.S. can’t legally force Mexico to pay for U.S. infrastructure, Trump and GOP leaders have suggested that there are other means of recouping construction costs from Mexico. In a January interview, House Speaker Ryan said: “We’re going to pay for it and front the money” and “There are a lot of different ways of getting Mexico to contribute to doing this.”

In April 2016, Trump said he could invoke the Patriot Act to cut off remittance payments to Mexico from Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. Mexicans sent home $25.7 billion in remittances in 2016, according to the Banco de Mexico. That's more than 95 percent of all remittances received by Mexico last year. Trump’s proposal would increase the requirements needed to wire money to a foreign nation, making it difficult for immigrants to send money home without documentation proving their legal status.

But Trump’s proposal has drawn skepticism from legal experts. A report from K&L Gates, an international law firm, said Trump’s plan raises constitutional questions and puts a significant burden on financial institutions. Stuart Anderson, the executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, said Trump’s interpretation of the Patriot Act is too broad, and he anticipates that the proposal would be challenged in court.

More recently, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the U.S. could “easily pay for the wall” by imposing a 20 percent adjustment tax on Mexican exports to the U.S. However, Trump’s team later clarified that a border tax was just “one idea” that might work.
