6 Reasons Why the Warriors Are Playing Their Best Basketball of the Season
6 Reasons Why the Warriors Are Playing Their Best Basketball of the Season
When the Warriors announced that Kevin Durant was likely going to be sidelined for more than a month as a result of a knee injury he suffered against the Wizards on Feb. 28, most NBA fans assumed it would mean the Warriors would struggle without him. And initially, they did. Golden State lost their next game to the Bulls, beat the Knicks and Hawks, and then suffered three straight losses against the Celtics, Timberwolves, and Spurs. It was their first three-game losing streak in three years. But the most demoralizing moment for the team came during a home game against the 76ers on March 14 as they were trying to snap that three-game streak. Despite the fact that the Sixers are, well, the Sixers, they grabbed a double-digit lead late in the third quarter of the game and looked like they were going to coast to an impressive road win over Golden State. It was a low moment for the Warriors, and many NBA fans reveled in the sudden downfall of the star-laden team. Warriors were brutal v the 76ers in the 5-10 min I watched, Idk how they won. It's honestly looked as if the MonStars made a trip to the bay The Warriors beat the 76ers at home last night by two points. Just how much trouble are they in for? Steph was 8-23 last night at home vs 76ers... tell me again how the Warriors are not in trouble? Fortunately, for Warriors fans at least, the team didn‚Äôt suffer a total meltdown against the Sixers. It wasn‚Äôt pretty, but Golden State rebounded to beat the Sixers 106-104, and it jumpstarted a winning streak that‚Äôs still going on today. Since beating Philadelphia, the Warriors have won eight more games in a row. And while a few of them were against teams that won't make the postseason like Magic, Kings, and Mavericks, the majority were against playoff teams like the Bucks, Thunder, Grizzlies, Rockets, and most recently, the Spurs. After falling behind by 22 points in the first quarter against San Antonio on Wednesday night, the Warriors came roaring back to win 110-98. Golden State now holds a 3.5-game lead over the Spurs in the Western Conference playoff race, and with just seven games left on their schedule, they appear to have the top spot all but locked up. So what do the Warriors owe this impressive winning streak? Some people are saying it‚Äôs all about their newfound commitment on the defensive side of the ball. Others are saying it has to do with Steph Curry locating his shot after a shooting slump. But our favorite suggestion thus far is that it has to do with‚Ä¶ a toaster? That‚Äôs right‚Äîa toaster. As pointed out on Thursday morning, the Warriors haven‚Äôt lost since Klay Thompson signed a toaster for a fan a couple weeks ago: Coincidence? Nah. pic.twitter.com/QOu8yR8HKP And you know what? We think they might just be on to something. Sure, the Warriors‚Äô defensive effort has been better in recent weeks, and yes, Curry is stroking the ball like he usually does again. But those aren't the only things that have sparked the Warriors' sudden string of success. Here are some other things‚Äîoutside of the toaster, of course‚Äîthey need to credit for helping them get back to their winning ways.

Here are some other things‚Äîoutside of the toaster, of course‚Äîthey need to credit for helping them get back to their winning ways.

1. Steph Curry‚Äôs Puppy

We got to meet our new baby boy last night! üòÜ the girls named him ROOKIE! 10 weeks-ish old! Couldn't be more fitting. He has my eyes lol. Our other boy Reza is thrilled to have a playmate. A post shared by Ayesha Curry (@ayeshacurry) on Mar 25, 2017 at 11:28am PDT

He also spent almost $4,000 on a Goldendoodle and named him Rookie. Shooting slump over.

2. Draymond Green‚Äôs Beef With Nicki Minaj

3. LaVar Ball‚Äôs Crazy Comments

At this point, LaVar Ball has said so many wild things that the stuff he said about Steph Curry a couple months ago has long been forgotten. But during an interview with TMZ Sports, he said his son Lonzo is going to be a better NBA player than Curry. He also reiterated that statement just last week on ESPN First Take. Curry has refused to comment on anything LaVar has said, but he‚Äôs let his play on the court do the talking in recent weeks

4. JaVale McGee‚Äôs Toilet Paper

Don‚Äôt sleep on the negative effect that some crappy 1-ply toilet paper can have on your life. Fortunately, the Warriors haven‚Äôt had to worry about that recently thanks to the JaVale McGee-branded TP Draymond Green brought to the team facility.

5. Charles Barkley‚Äôs Bold Prediction

Charles Barkley gave the Warriors "zero chance" to win an NBA title without Kevin Durant in the lineup just days after he was ruled out with a knee injury. But he also gave them next to no chance to win the title a couple years ago because he said they were nothing more than a jump-shooting team. And we all remember how that turned out, right?
