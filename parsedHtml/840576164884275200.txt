Finally, a VR chair that won't make you nauseous
Tom Cruise lied and told me I'd feel like I was floating in zero gravity. OK, Cruise didn't really lie to me IRL, but he did in VR, after I strapped on an Oculus Rift VR headset and sat down in a Positron Voyager VR cinema chair to try out the at SXSW 2017 .

Like all immersive theater chairs â€” you know, like those 4D movie chairs that rock back and forth to make you feel every explosion â€” the Voyager promises to make you feel like you're the movie. The key differences between the Voyager, which resembles an egg chair from the 1960s, and existing 4D seats is that it's designed just for VR movies and it likely won't give you motion sickness.
