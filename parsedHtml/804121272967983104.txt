100 Women 2016: On the frontline with the women policing the peace in Afghanistan - BBC News


Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous places on earth to be a police officer. Between chaotic roads and a growing Taliban insurgency, few places are harder. But, if it is difficult for the men who serve, things are even worse for their female colleagues. As a result, the country has a chronic shortage of women police officers.

Sana Safi travelled to one of the busiest and most dangerous checkpoints in the capital to find out the impact it is having, and what they are trying to do about it.
