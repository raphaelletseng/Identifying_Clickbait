She spoke with class & dignity. “It’s almost a trend in the SNP not to want to accept the outcome of referendums,” the audience member said. “I voted to remain but I accept the outcome was to leave [and] I don’t think MPs can then change the decision that was made by millions of people democratically.” obertson replied: “I totally accept there was a majority across the UK to leave the EU. There was a majority in England and there was a majority in Wales to leave the EU. There was a majority in Scotland to remain in the EU. “That’s why the Scottish Government is working quite hard to try and reach a compromise with the UK Government to find a deal that can satisfy all of us. “And I think on such a big issue it behoves a British Prime minister and Scotland’s First Minister to try and find that arrangement.” More viral TV gold his furious newsreader threw a massive a tantrum over her colleague's matching dress .
