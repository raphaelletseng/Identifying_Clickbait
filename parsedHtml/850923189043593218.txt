Alec Baldwin Is Back As Donald Trump in 'SNL' Cold Open
Alec Baldwin is back as Donald Trump. For tonight’s cold open, Baldwin as Trump wanted to be with his people and address the nation’s current affairs. In a town hall meeting, Trump addressed jobs (“In Trump’s America, men work in two places: coal mines and Goldman Sachs), healthcare (“After we’re done, you’ll never have to drive to see a doctor again. How’s that sound?”), and other issues. In between fielding questions, Trump would ask the crowd their thoughts about the Syria strikes, which were awkwardly funny. “You still love Trump? We still love Trump?,” he said. “Remember I’m one of you! Remember I’m one of you!” Watch Trump talk to regular people above.
