Twitter Loses It Over Report Rex Tillerson Doesn't Allow Eye Contact
Twitter Loses It Over Report Rex Tillerson Doesn't Allow Eye Contact
A report in the Washington Post about Rex Tillerson caused a flurry of speculation on Twitter that the secretary of state may be a vampire, a basilisk or perhaps even Medusa. The Post reported that some career diplomats working under Tillerson “have been instructed not to speak to him directly ― or even make eye contact .” The report also said career State Department workers “swap paranoid stories about Tillerson that often turn out to be untrue,” so the veracity of the forbidden eye contact rule is unclear. But that little tidbit caused Tillerson’s name to trend on Twitter late Thursday with more than 20,000 tweets weighing in, and many were wondering just what was up with America’s top diplomat. Here’s a sampling: What? Don't make eye contact? Or Rex will turn you into stone or what exactly?!? https://t.co/0aFddzZ6gy As a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Cmte, I find this article disturbing. I'm worried about Rex Tillerson.
