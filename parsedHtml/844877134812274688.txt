Outpouring of support for Jacqui Lambie's emotional Senate speech on social media

Australians have taken to social media to throw support behind independent Senator Jacqui Lambie after she made an emotional plea to Government to reconsider welfare cuts, speaking of her own struggles as a single mother on the disability support pension for seven years.

During a late-night sitting, Senator Lambie told the chamber she wanted them to know what is was like "to be at the bottom of the crap pile".

"It is shameful and embarrassing, but we do it not because we want to but because circumstances put us there," she said.

"And for you to take more money off those people, you have no idea how bloody tough it is, every little cent counts to those people.

"If you really realised the damage that you are doing to that part of society, you would stop doing it.

"We're not living when we are like that, we are surviving, we are in a bloody war zone and we are surviving.

"We are surviving to put bread on the table to make sure our kids can get the basics in life, so our kids can go to decent schools if we want that choice.

"I drove an unregistered car â€¦ [I drove] without having a licence because I couldn't renew it.

"I want you know what it is like to be at the bottom of the crap pile through no fault of our own."

Both supporters and opponents of the Senator praised her for representing ordinary, struggling Australians.

"I don't always agree with your political ideas but you were raw, brave and honourable. You should be proud," @shazbucket wrote on Twitter.

"Thank you Jacqui. I am unable to work due to complex spinal issues. I struggle so much. You captured all our pain," @deancon76 wrote.
