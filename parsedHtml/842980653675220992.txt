A Comeback, a Controversial Call and Some Crackle at the N.C.A.A.s
A Comeback, a Controversial Call and Some Crackle at the N.C.A.A.s
Once again, there were no buzzer-beaters, no unexpected upsets or overtime thrillers, but at least the second day of the N.C.A.A. tournament offered a few reasons not to change the channel. Each of the four venues Friday hosted an early game that extracted a welcome dollop of drama, with three decided in the final seconds. The nail-biting finishes would not include four blue-blood programs, No. 1 seeds Kansas and North Carolina, and No. 2 seeds Duke and Kentucky, each of whom won their games against outmatched opponents with little cause for alarm. Nor would any drama embroil the No. 3 seeds, Baylor, Oregon and U.C.L.A., who handled their business. No, the most climactic ending involved Southern California, as it often does. Like trick candles at a child’s birthday party, the Trojans just cannot be extinguished. In what was their 13th comeback victory from a double-digit deficit this season, they edged Southern Methodist, 66-65, in the East Region, when the Mustangs’ final shot clanged off the rim. The Trojans became the second No. 11 seed to oust a No. 6 seed, and a third joined them a few hours later, as Rhode Island never trailed en route to bludgeoning Creighton, 84-72. A fourth No. 11 seed, Kansas State, fell against the defensive juggernaut Cincinnati, which won handily, 75-61. Advertisement Amid all the blowouts so far administered by the contenders, the upsets restored some crackle — if not the desired outright mayhem — to the bracket after the least eventful opening day of the tournament since 2000, when the higher seeds went 15-1. Advertisement They went 14-2 on Thursday, a trend that continued Friday in the first five games — but almost didn’t. Arkansas scored the final 7 points while benefiting from a controversial call in the final seconds to defeat Seton Hall, 77-71, in the South. Trailing by a point with about 20 seconds left, the No. 9 Pirates — who lost in their only national championship game appearance, to Michigan in 1989, after a dubious foul call — set about trying to foul Arkansas in order to regain possession quickly. Desi Rodriguez did so, pushing Jaylen Barford in the back, causing him to fall. The officials called an immediate foul, and after reviewing the play, ruled a Flagrant-1 foul, which awarded Arkansas two foul shots and possession. Barford made both free throws, and Daryl Macon followed by making one of two to seal the victory. J. D. Collins, the N.C.A.A.’s national coordinator of men’s basketball officiating, supported the officials’ decision afterward in an interview on TNT, saying that any time a player “puts two hands in the back and doesn’t make any attempt to play the ball or the player in front of him,” it’s a flagrant-1 foul. Advertisement Barford said he was surprised that he was shoved, though Seton Hall Coach Kevin Willard disputed Rodriguez’s intent. “If you’ve been around the game long enough, you’ve got to know time, score — you’ve got to know what’s going on,” Willard said, adding, “But they reffed a good game all night. So I can’t really complain about whether I agree or not. I’m always going to disagree with it. That’s what coaches do.” Advertisement Coaches also do not lament what they do not have, and Oregon pressed on Friday in its second game without the shot-blocking menace Chris Boucher, who tore a knee ligament last weekend in the Pacific-12 tournament semifinals. Sitting on the bench, Boucher watched his teammates throttle No. 14 Iona, 93-77, in a Midwest Region game that the Ducks once led by 27 points. North Carolina, the top seed in the South, dwarfed that margin in clobbering No. 16 Texas Southern, 103-64, while No. 2 Louisville distanced itself in the second half from pesky Jacksonville State, winning by 78-65 in the Midwest. Advertisement No. 3 Baylor exploited its physical dominance against undersized No. 14 New Mexico State in the second half, cruising to a 91-73 victory in the East Region. Advertisement U.C.L.A., the third seed in the South, never had too much to worry about with Kent State, whom it beat, 97-80. But late in the first half, the Bruins held their breath when the freshman sensation Lonzo Ball landed hard on his right hip after leaping for a pass. Ball was knocked down, but not out. He finished the game with 15 points and 3 assists. Advertisement Earlier in the evening, after trailing, 19-8, midway through the first half to No. 8 Miami, Michigan State woke up. And oh, did it ever: The Spartans outscored the Hurricanes, 70-39, to win by 20 in Tulsa, Okla.

In its play-in game on Wednesday against Providence, U.S.C. had to erase a 15-point halftime deficit just to join the main field. Down by 12 against S.M.U. on Friday, the Trojans grabbed their first lead with about two minutes left, then scored the game’s final points on an Elijah Stewart 3-pointer with 36 seconds left. After each team missed the first free throw of a one-and-one, S.M.U. played for a final shot, an errant off-balance leaner by Shake Milton. Tim Jankovich, the S.M.U. coach, mentioned the introductory sequence of “Wide World of Sports” when describing his emotions afterward — the agony of defeat. “I can certainly relate to that show right now,” Jankovich said. The other U.S.C., South Carolina, pulled away late from No. 10 Marquette to win, 93-73, in Greenville, S.C.

After the game, Rams forward Hassan Martin summed up what it feels like to give Rhode Island its first N.C.A.A. tournament win since 1998.
