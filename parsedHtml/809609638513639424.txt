President-elect Donald Trump spoke highly of tech tycoon Peter Thiel at a meeting with Silicon Valley executives held in Trump Tower Wednesday.

Trump discussed his relationship with Thiel, who openly endorsed Trump during the Republican National Convention. Thiel is best known for co-founding the digital payment company PayPal, sitting on the Facebook board of directors and most recently funding a high profile court case that Hulk Hogan brought against gossip blog Gawker.

“Well, I just want to thank everybody. This is a truly amazing group of people,” said Trump addressing tech executives such as Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Elon Musk of Tesla, and Tim Cook of Apple. “I won’t tell you the hundreds of calls we’ve had, asking to come to this meeting. And I will say Peter [Thiel] would sort of say, ‘You know, that company’s too small.’ And these are monster companies. And I just want to start by thanking Peter. Because he saw something very early, maybe before we saw it.”

President-elect Trump continued, “And of course he’s known for that in a different way. But he’s been so terrific and so outstanding. And he got about just the biggest applause at the Republican National Convention,” the President-elect said, referencing Peter Thiel’s RNC speech, “He’s ahead of the curve. And I want to thank you. You’re a very special guy.”
