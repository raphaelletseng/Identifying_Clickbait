Kobe Bryant Gifts Oregon Ducks with New Nike Kobe A.D. NXT Shoe
. @OregonMBB had a visitor last night speak and present to the team his new FW. Thank you @kobebryant @nikebasketball https://t.co/VG2FiVmY05 It's a great week to be a Duck! After fighting their way to the Final Four as a No. 3 seed in the 2017 NCAA tournament, the Oregon Ducks are on a good streak. Now the team has Kobe Bryant in its corner as it gears up to take on the No. 1 North Carolina Tar Heels on Saturday to stake its spot in the championship game against either Gonzaga or South Carolina. The NBA legend showed up to personally deliver a pair of Nike Kobe A.D. NXT shoes to each player. They came in special-edition packaging that included Black Mamba pins. The kicks are appropriately in Oregon colors, so it seems the Ducks may have an extra boost on their feet in Phoenix. [ Twitter ] Like the new article format? Send us feedback ! Where can I comment?
