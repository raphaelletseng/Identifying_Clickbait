Laser attacks on Heathrow aircraft increase 25%

Press Association    Laser attacks on aircraft using Heathrow airport rose by a quarter last year, figures show. Pilots taking off or landing at the west London hub suffered 151 incidents in 2016. This is up from 121 during the previous year and was more than any other UK airport, according to aviation regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Former RAF and British Airways pilot Steve Landells warned that shining a laser at an aircraft was “incredibly dangerous”. Landells, flight safety specialist at pilots’ association Balpa, said: “The power of these devices is increasing and we’re concerned that, if left to escalate without significant intervention, we could see a serious incident happen in the near future.” The number of laser attacks at Glasgow airport almost doubled to 83 in 2016, making it the second most targeted airport. Birmingham was third at 73, followed by Manchester (72), London City (62) and London Gatwick (55). The total for the UK was 1,258, down from 1,439 during the previous year. Last summer, the head of the CAA called for people found carrying powerful laser pointers to be arrested even if they were not using them. Andrew Haines, the chief executive of the regulator, told the Press Association: “Why does Joe Bloggs walking down the street need a laser that can pop a balloon at 50 miles, that can cause permanent damage to a pilot?” Earlier this month, the Department for Transport (DfT) announced plans to introduce new legislation that would leave people who shine lasers at pilots liable to be jailed or face hefty fines. It is already an offence to endanger aircraft by shining lasers at pilots, and offenders can be fined up to £2,500. Under the new plans, police will only have to prove the offence of shining the laser. The powers and penalties will be outlined in upcoming legislation. The first laser attack on an aircraft was reported in 2004, with over 200 attacks reported each year by 2008. Since 2011, there have been about 1,500 attacks annually. 1. Heathrow (151) 2.
