Nasa announces press conference on 'discovery beyond our solar system'Â 
asa will hold a press conference on Wednesday to present a "discovery beyond our solar system," leading to speculation that the announcement will involve planets capable of sustaining life. The agency has offered no details on the upcoming presentation other than that it will involve "exoplanets". Astronomers have been studying such planets, which orbit stars other than the sun , for clues as to whether, and where, life could exist beyond the earth. asa has analysed dozens of planets that orbit sun-like stars at similar distances as the earth to the sun. The first earth-like planet to be discovered was, Kepler-186f, a rocky planet that lies within the so-called "habitable zone" and is similar in size to earth. The Kepler space telescope has now located many more such planets . At a press conference earlier this year Nasa announced the discoveries of 1,284 new planets, nine of which were in the "habitable zone".Â Help find the next exoplanet!

And the first sign of answering this question is looking at exoplanets," he said. he US space agency has now identified 3,449 exoplanets in 2,577 solar systems. Among those planets, 348 are considered earth-like . ednesday's press conference will take place at 6 pm GMT (1 pm EST) on Wednesday.
