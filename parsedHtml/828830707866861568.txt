Watch Lady Gaga's Epic Super Bowl Performance in 30 Seconds  by   FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS  Lady Gaga 's epic Super Bowl halftime performance had it all: patriotic songs, red, white and blue drones, bungee jumping, tons of pyro and a moving performance of the ballad "Million Reasons." At points it felt like it would never end (and who wanted it to?). But like all good halftime extravaganzas, it had to wind down to let the teams back on the field for what turned out to be the greatest big game comeback in history. If you want to get a sense of how much work goes into putting on the show, check out this incredible time-lapse video of the set-up, performance and tear-down of Gaga's extravaganza posted by Cincinnati Bengals beat writer Paul Dehner Jr.  Halftime timelapse. The coordination is ridiculous. #SB51  pic.twitter.com/kfEbpy6mvW     FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS
