South Carolina Teen Nabbed at Airport Charged With Trying to Join ISIS


Bill Cosby is trying to keep his civil settlement with accuser Andrea Constand out of his criminal sexual-assault trial.

Cosby is charged with drugging and molesting Constand during a visit to his Pennsylvania home in 2004 — the only criminal case stemming from dozens of accusations of sexual misconduct. She sued him in 2005 and the case was settled for an undisclosed sum in 2006.

A judge has already ruled that prosecutors can use a deposition Cosby gave in the civil case — in which he discusses the encounter with Constand, as well as giving women pills in the 1970s — at his criminal trial.

Now his lawyers are arguing that jurors should not hear about the lawsuit negotiations or the settlement because the value of the information "is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice."

Cosby is due back in court on Monday, when a judge will hear arguments on several outstanding issues — including whether the jury can hear details of his conduct with women besides Constand and the one other accuser who is being allowed to take the stand.

His team is also asking that potential jurors fill out written questionnaires that will gauge what news coverage of the case they have seen, whether they think Cosby is guilty and whether they know anyone who was accused of or the victim of sexual assault.

Cosby has denied wrongdoing and has sued some of his accusers for defamation.
