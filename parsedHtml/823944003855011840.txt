Cab Driver Praises John Elway Without Realizing He's in Back Seat
As John Elway quietly sat in the back seat, a Washington cab driver carried on a conversation about the former Denver Broncos quarterback with the other passengers. Before the other riders tried making the scene awkward by discussing Elway's looks, driver Sam Snow declared him the No. 1 quarterback. The Pittsburgh Steelers fan then reluctantly put Tom Brady into the discussion before selecting Ben Roethlisberger as his biased No. 3. The riders finally told him to turn around, and he immediately recognized the Hall of Famer. This wasn't one of those half-hearted undercover angles where alleged fans can't recognize a star in a wig. The driver was simply doing his job and keeping his eyes on the road. After the reveal, Snow asked for a picture and recalled Elway's Broncos beating the Steelers in the 1998 AFC Championship Game. [ Facebook ] Like the new article format? Send us feedback !
