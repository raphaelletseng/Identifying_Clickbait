Pope Francis is leading Easter celebrations in front of thousands of pilgrims who have gathered in St Peter's Square in the Vatican.

At an earlier vigil, he spoke of migrants' pain, and criticised "paralysing and barren bureaucracies that stand in the way of change".

He will later read his "Urbi et Orbi" ("To the City and the World") message from St Peter's Basilica.

Pope Francis is expected to discuss interfaith dialogue.

Easter was also marked in Coptic churches in Egypt, where attacks a week ago, claimed by Islamic State militants, killed at least 45 people.
