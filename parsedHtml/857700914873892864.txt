(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP/Getty Images) Investors are loving the new-look Microsoft under Satya Nadella, but a relatively flat revenue performance in Q3 earning relative to expectations halted its steady stock rise at least temporarily on Thursday. Microsoft reported earnings of $0.73 per share for the fiscal third quarter, ahead of market estimates of $0.69. But the company reported revenue of $23.6 billion, on par with some Wall Street consensus and just under consensus as polled by Thomson Reuters by $60 million. Shares of Microsoft were trading at $67.10, down $1.17 or about 1.71% as of 4:25 pm ET in after-hours trading. The fall back comes after the company had hit its all-time high of $68.31 just a day before earnings, which had driven shares up 6% over the past three months. While much of the goodwill surrounding Nadella's efforts since taking the helm at Microsoft in February 2014 stem from the company's increased focus on cloud, revenue growth from the category is only beginning to appear on its balance sheet, analysts have warned. "We know their cloud business is doing well... but how much so?" asked Forrester vice president Chris Voce before the report. "Increasing Azure consumption has been their #1 sales priority." With intelligent cloud revenue of $6.8 billion for the quarter, or growth of 11% and 12% in constant currency, Microsoft exceeded some analyst expectations for that business unit, with Azure growth at 93% in revenue, but growth isn't keeping up with the torrid pace of past years as Microsoft achieves more scale. Azure, considered the industry's second biggest cloud platform after Amazon, had grown 120% for the same quarter a year before. In its first quarter contributing revenue to Microsoft's earnings, LinkedIn contributed revenue of $975 million, just ahead of what some analysts had predicted, and without guidance on its margins, meaning analysts will have questions for Nadella when he speak to them about the results. Combined with Office growth of 15% in consumer and 7% in commercial, Dynamics' 10% growth (81% for Dynamics 365), the productivity and business processes unit at Microsoft reported $8 billion in revenue, up 22% and 23% in constant currency. The same group without LinkedIn and 365 had grown just 1% for the same quarter a year before. Print Send Us Feedback Report Corrections Reprints & Permissions Trending on {{channel_name}}

Investors are loving the new-look Microsoft under Satya Nadella, but a relatively flat revenue performance in Q3 earning relative to expectations halted its steady stock rise at least temporarily on Thursday.

Microsoft reported earnings of $0.73 per share for the fiscal third quarter, ahead of market estimates of $0.69. But the company reported revenue of $23.6 billion, on par with some Wall Street consensus and just under consensus as polled by Thomson Reuters by $60 million.

“Our results this quarter reflect the trust customers are placing in the Microsoft Cloud,” Nadella said in a statement. “From large multi-nationals to small and medium businesses to non-profits all over the world, organizations are using Microsoft’s cloud platforms to power their digital transformation.”

While much of the goodwill surrounding Nadella's efforts since taking the helm at Microsoft in February 2014 stem from the company's increased focus on cloud, revenue growth from the category is only beginning to appear on its balance sheet, analysts have warned.
