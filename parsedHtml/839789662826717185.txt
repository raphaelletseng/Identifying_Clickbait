Indonesian court sentences journalist David Fox to seven months' jail for drug possession

Posted

Former war correspondent and Reuters journalist David Fox has received a seven-month jail sentence for possessing the drug hashish.

Fox has already served the majority of the sentence and should be released from Bali's Kerobokan prison in a few months.

He was arrested along with Australian man Giuseppe Serafino who will be sentenced next week.

"[I'm] very grateful for the lenient sentence," Fox told reporters after the judges had delivered their verdict.

"I am very grateful to my legal team and all of my friends and supporters who helped me get through this."

The British man's defence team had argued Fox used the drug because he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder caused by years spent working as a war correspondent.

Outside the court the 55-year-old said he would begin rehabilitation once he was released from prison.

Prosecutors have not revealed whether they will appeal the decision.

Mr Serafino, 48, who is originally from Western Australia faces charges of possessing category one narcotics.

Prosecutors this week recommended he be jailed for one year. He will learn his fate on Tuesday next week.
