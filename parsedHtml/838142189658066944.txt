Inside Japan's eerie abandoned amusement parks
Inside Japan's eerie abandoned amusement parks


A rusting Ferris wheel has ground to a halt, the only movement comes from its garish carriages which haven’t been ridden for decades, swaying in the breeze.

This towering structure is the last remnant of Family Land which closed to visitors in 1970. The eerie fairground near Biwa lake is just one of many abandoned themeparks in Japan, neglected due to economic woes and reclaimed by nature.

Traveller and photographer Reginald Van de Velde, from Belgium, explored four of the country’s forgotten amusement parks capturing the hauntingly dilapidated structures left behind, on camera.

He explained why he was drawn to them: ‘The Land of the Rising Sun is filled with derelict goodies, and they're on a scale you've never seen before. Escapism is at the basis of my explorations, and it's the solitude I want to capture and share through my photographs.'

During his photography expedition, Mr Van de Velde also snapped Western Village in Tokyo, where a giant $27million replica of Mount Rushmore looms gloomily over faded scenes from the Wild West, populated by primitive animatronics.

He also prowled the empty streets of mesmerising Nara Dreamland. Dating back to 1961 it was once hailed Japan’s answer to Disneyland but now its iconic pink castle and carousel are gripped by decay. Topping off his tour of forgotten childhood delights, he photographed Big Mountain Pachinko - a mechanical arcade game filled with glassy eyed toys which were never destined to be won.

A shooting gallery is seen inside the former Western Village theme park. It was built in 1975 and was forced to close down in 2007 reportedly due to its remote location and competition from the increasing success of Disneyland Tokyo
