Live Performance and Q&A With the Indie Rock Band Real Estate
Caryn Ganz Music Editor  Hello everyone, hello Joe! Before things get going here, let’s talk about Real Estate’s history for a moment. The band just released its fourth album, “In Mind,” this month, on Domino Records. This album is a little different because it’s the group’s first without guitarist Matt Mondanile, correct?   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  That’s right, Caryn. Real Estate was originally formed around 2008 by old friends from New Jersey — suburban malaise (with hints of nostalgia) is a constant theme in their music — and the band put out its first album, “Real Estate,” in 2009. It got a lot of buzz on the influential music websites of the time, including Pitchfork, and they signed to Domino for the follow-up, “Days.”   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  But yes, Mondanile left after the next one, “Atlas,” to focus on his project Ducktails, although Real Estate has more or less kept its woozy, mid-tempo indie rock sound intact for “In Mind.”   Caryn Ganz Music Editor  The music begins at 7:30 p.m. ET, and we’d love to ask Real Estate your questions, so please start suggesting them!   Caryn Ganz Music Editor  We’re watching Real Estate play “Time” from the new album right now, a song with a hazy, laid-back vibe that sounds like it was born in the most mellow Brazilian club in Malibu.   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  Super chill!   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  One of our music critics, Jon Caramanica, has referred to the band’s “ bucolic vibes ” and “ modern indie-rock lullabies ” — music for “backyards and sprawl and lethargy.”   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  I think all of that holds for this new album, too, even though super big fans might notice subtle differences in the guitar lines after the lineup change.   Caryn Ganz Music Editor  We’ll be asking Real Estate your questions after this song, so keep them coming!   TM Todd McAllister Reader, Provo, UT  How did the experience of recording “Atlas” in a live way compare to the experience of recording “In Mind” using the studio almost as an instrument itself?     Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin says that they got ‘weirder’ with the sounds with this new album than they did with Atlas.   JS Jonathan R. S. Reader, San Jose, CA  I’ve been a fan of the band since I saw the self-titled LP’s album cover and got really curious. What is that a picture of?   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin says the album cover is a photo of a building from a ‘conceptual architect.’   T Thatcher Reader, Minneapolis, MN  what kind of effects went into the cool new fuzzy guitar sound in songs like serve the song and two arrows?   JR JJ Ryan Reader, Fremont, CA  Martin: Why is the band named “Real Estate,” is there a specific story behind it?   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin gives the story behind the name of the band. Right when he was starting the band, he was getting his real estate license. They were practicing at his parents’ house, and his parents joked that they should all get their real estate licenses.   WM Will Moseley Reader, Carrollton, Ga  How has the dynamic of the band changed over the course of 4 albums?   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin says having families ‘definitely changed things.’   Caryn Ganz Music Editor  Next up is “Stained Glass.” This song has pretty strong Byrds vibes.   Caryn Ganz Music Editor  Can you talk a little bit about the kinds of influences you’re hearing on the new record, Joe?     Joe Coscarelli Reporter  Yep, the guitar intro on “Stained Glass” is straight-up ‘70s stuff. But it’s not shredding — just very melodic, clean and bright.   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  The rest of the album is in a similar mode — fans of the old stuff will not be disappointed — but I do get some flashes of Elliott Smith in the vocals.   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  (The relatively happy, more upbeat Elliott Smith. Relatively!)   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  They’ve also grown up a bit: Martin Courtney, the lead singer and songwriter, is a father now — and doing the family thing is pretty different than doing the “band that lives in Brooklyn” thing, so I think some of that comes through in the lyrics.   Caryn Ganz Music Editor  We’d love to ask Real Estate your questions, so make sure you submit some!   AS Andrew Smith Reader, United Kingdom  Is there any chance of seeing some studio footage during the recording of In Mind, similar to the mini documentary about the recording of Atlas?   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin says, ‘No… We can compile 3.5 minutes on our phones.’   GM Geoffrey Melcher Reader, Nashville, Tennessee  Ryan Adams used to say that his personal taste in music was in no way reflective of “the style I write songs in.” Do you find this more or less true in how Real Estate writes it’s songs? How much is the music, at this point in your career, aesthetic versus exploration?   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin says, ‘That’s a tough one. … We spend time together working out the arrangements’ so things take turns when we meet up   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Alex says, ‘The idea is to continue to explore. Exploration is always the idea.’     R Roy Reader, Baltimore, MD  Dear Real Estate, First of all, you are my favorite band. Your music is timeless; I find myself playing it on all occasions. Congrats on the new record. I saw you for the first time in Bangkok back in 2015 (I have the setlist sitting next to me right now!). Do you have any particularly cool/weird/crazy memories from that short Asia tour? Thanks and I can’t wait to see you at 930 Club!   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Jackson says that they had amazing food.   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin says that was ‘an interesting tour. That was awesome.’   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Alex said that he had the best bowl of noodles in Taiwan. It just happened to be Chinese New Year, when the band was there.   L Luke Reader, Atlanta ga  This question is for Julian. Even though you’ve played shows and grew up with the band, what’s the experience like being in the band now?   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Julian says, ‘It’s been really nice. They’ve been really nice to me.’   K Kyle Reader, East Islip, NY  How did New Jersey influence Real Estate’s wavy sound? Also, any book recommendations?!   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Julian says, ‘All sounds are wavy.’   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Alex says, ‘I don’t know if it’s New Jersey specifically.’ He says that they were in a place where it was conducive to make good music.   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin says that he reads a lot of children’s books.     Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Julian says that he’s been reading a novel by Nicola Griffith.   CE Charlie Elle Reader, Nashville, TN  Is there any advice you could give to someone trying to start a band around the age you guys started Real Estate? Maybe tips or tricks you wish you knew back then?   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin says, ‘We just played until people we were sick of us.’   T Tim Reader, Austin, TX  As composers of contemporary music, do you all have any favorite classical composers or pieces?   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Martin says he just listens to Chopin.   MO Matthew O'Donohue Reader, Australia  Alex, why do you consistently have one contribution on each album? Is it something that Real Estate consciously decides to do - having one of your songs? Or do you go in with something in mind? Or has it just so happened that you’ve come up with one each time you recorded? Love Diamond Eyes by the way.   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Alex says, ‘It just happened to work out that way this time.’   Real Estate Indie Rock Band  Alex says, ‘The template has always been open for any member to contribute… It’s kind of the Ringo thing.’   Caryn Ganz Music Editor  Real Estate is closing the set now with “Saturday,” the last song on the new album, which is a bit more sprawling than the tracks we’ve heard so far.   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  A nice tempo change in this one, where the sort of mournful, drawn out first part turns into something much more playful.   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  The lyrical imagery — “a screened-in porch in a rainstorm,” “a stranger is living in your old house” — is also classic Real Estate.   Joe Coscarelli Reporter  For those in the area wanting more, the band plays Brooklyn Steel tonight with Frankie Cosmos. Then in June, they’re off to tour Europe, followed by some festival dates through the rest of the summer and into the fall.  Thank you, we will review your submission soon. We’re sorry, we could not save your response. Please try again.
