Belgium train crash: Several hurt in Leuven derailment - BBC News


Several people have been injured when a train carriage fell on to its side following a derailment close to the Belgian capital Brussels, rescue workers and railway officials say.

The accident happened as the train was departing Leuven station at a slow speed heading towards the capital.

Emergency services are at the scene. The number of casualties is unclear.

Photos on the internet showed one damaged carriage on its side next to a downwards slope.

Services between Leuven and Brussels have been suspended, officials say.

Last June at least three people were killed and nine injured in a train crash in the town of Hermalle-sous-Huy, near Liege.

In February 2010, 18 people were killed when two passenger trains collided at Halle, south-west of the capital, Brussels.
