What Is Hawaii?
You may have questions about Hawaii. Many Americans do. After all, Hawaii is quite far from mainland United States — about 2,390 miles from the West Coast.

So perhaps it should be no surprise that at least one high-ranking federal official thinks of Hawaii as a distant island. Here are some answers to questions about Hawaii. Can you drive to Hawaii?

Oahu is the most populated island, with more than 953,000 people in 2010, according to the latest census data. The state capital, Honolulu, is there. It claims to be the most diverse state, based on the 2010 census. More than 60 percent of Hawaii’s people are Asian. The Filipino population overtook the Japanese population to become the largest Asian group in the state in 2010. In 2014, there were nearly 370,000 Hawaiian residents described by the census as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders. About 20 percent of the population can trace ancestry to the original population, a Pew study found. Did anything important ever happen there? On Dec. 7, 1941, “a date which will live in infamy,” President Roosevelt informed the nation, “the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.” The attack on Pearl Harbor on Oahu brought the United States into World War II, leading to America’s rise as the pre-eminent global superpower for decades to come.
