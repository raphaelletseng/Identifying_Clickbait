How to use Gmail templates to answer emails faster
What's more of a time-suck than spending all day writing email? You could probably name a few things like vacuuming, getting lost in subreddits, and browsing through Instagram. But still, nothing is worse than wasting your life away responding to emails.

That's more than half the workday, and that number is sure to be higher today! Luckily, there's a way to automate the process (and maybe even prevent early carpal tunnel syndrome from kicking in) in Gmail, especially if you tend to send the same redundant email all day, every day. There's a feature in Gmail called "Canned Responses" that lets you create email templates that you can reuse later, so you're not writing things like thank you letters over and over. And, it's free!

And then, scroll to the bottom and click "Save Changes" (you do this or the feature won't activate): Image:  raymond wong/mashable Creating templates: Once your Gmail tab refreshes, compose a new email. My suggestion is to leave the "To" and "Subject" fields blank, but you can fill in either if you prefer. Now we're going to create a new template.

Maybe use all the saved time to meditate or stand up (Because sitting all day will kill you faster !). And you can make as many canned responses as you want for different responses. It may not seem faster at first, but trust me, if all of the minutes do add up over time. WATCH: Google Earth Timelapse shows how man has altered the planet in 32 years
