The India national capital has spent over Rs 2,000 crore on Yamuna clean-up in the last 22 years but the reality has only become starker when you consider the recent and the past data that shows absolutely no improvement in the water quality.

Despite this, believers continue to believe in Yamuna, bathe in the toxic pool, toss tonnes of debris in the name of religion and drink from it. This revered lake continues to attract devotees during festivals and celebrations around it. A river that reeks almost always has now become a subject of debate, lest action.

These known stretches of the Yamuna that originate from the Himalayas and flow 855 miles to the Ganges River are now officially dead. Foam now covers large swaths of the water, making passersby cover their mouths and nose with a cloth.

And so, it is safe to say that the Yamuna has become home to total disaster, loaded with mostly human and animal excreta remaining to be in lakhs and even crores when the standard is a maximum of 5,000 mpn/100 ml (most probably number/100 ml).

So how long before the quaint inebriation?

The court’s declaration may not be enough to save her, but it definitely marks a start.
