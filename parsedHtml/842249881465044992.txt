Swiss National Bank May Raise 2017 Inflation Forecast: Chart
While it’s set to maintain monetary policy on Thursday, the Swiss National Bank might revise up its 2017 inflation forecast as higher energy costs boost headline price pressures. Switzerland’s annual rate hasn’t been positive since 2011, and the SNB’s most recent projection is for a rise in consumer prices of just 0.1 percent this year. Earlier this week, the country’s Federal Statistics Office raised its 2017 inflation estimate to 0.5 percent.
