LordeÂ is set to perform on Saturday Night Live tonight (March 11), and her loyal army of fans can't wait to see what she brings to the SNL stage -- especially since she hasn't delivered a televised performance since the 2016 Brits (which was a David Bowie tribute, not her own material).

After releasing two new songs in the last week, SNLÂ is the perfect opportunity for Lorde to perform her new material. But what will she end up singing? And will we see her in a skit? We can only hope.

Ahead of Lorde's highly anticipatedÂ SNLÂ performance, take a look at the things we're hoping to see from her.

The live debut of "Green Light" (and/or "Liability")

SNLÂ musical guests always perform two songs, and Lorde just so happens to have two new songs out. Coincidence? We'd like to think not.

Plus, "Green Light" is an upbeat anthem while "Liability" is a beautifulÂ ballad, which would allow Lorde to show both a fun and a vulnerable side during her appearance. Yeah... this should definitely happen.

Another new song

If Lorde isn't going to sing the two songs she's already released, we'd love to get a glimpse of what else she has in store with her upcoming sophomore albumÂ MelodramaÂ -- especially since we still have to wait three months before the LP drops (it's dueÂ June 16).Â

Jack AntonoffÂ playing piano

Some fans who've watched Lorde's "Green Light" music video might not have caught that the guy playing the piano in the background was in fact Mr. Antonoff himself. He andÂ LordeÂ worked onÂ MelodramaÂ together for 18 months, so it'd only feel right to have the New York-based musician appear onstage with her. Or, at the very least, beÂ in attendance to watch some of the songs they wroteÂ come to life.Â

Â

An Alessia Cara impression

This may seem out of left field, but it's actuallyÂ quite a valid desire. Cara absolutely nailed an impression of LordeÂ while playing "Wheel of Impressions" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and this seems like the perfect opportunityÂ forÂ LordeÂ to try her hand at imitating the "Scars to Your Beautiful" singer. Ariana Grande did impressions in an SNL skit, so let's see Lorde do the same!

(If youÂ haven'tÂ seen Cara singing Lorde, please indulgeÂ at 3:47)

A carÂ for her to dance uponÂ

LordeÂ has quite the dance party on top of an SUV in the "Green Light" video, which would be a pretty cool thing to re-enact on the SNL stage.Â She's always been one for dramatic performances, so for her first televised performance of the year, why not go big?
