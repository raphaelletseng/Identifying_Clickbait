This Silicon Valley couple saves animals from slaughter â take a look inside their farm


ManyÂ Silicon Valley transplants leave their hacker houses or shoe-box apartments in the morning and climb aboard shuttle busesÂ to work.Â Anna Sweet, a Facebook employee, and her husband Nate Salpeter, a nuclear energy engineer, commute from their farm.

The prospect of juggling careers in tech and farming didn't faze the husband-wife team when they opened Sweet Farm, an animal sanctuary and non-profit organization, in 2016. The farm promotes the humane treatment of animals by providing a loving home for livestock saved from meat markets. Sweet and Salpeter also work to educate visitors about the many places from which their food comes and encourage them to lead more livestock-friendly lifestyles.

We visited the Half Moon Bay, California, sanctuary to see what life is like there.
