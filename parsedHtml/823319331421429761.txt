Azealia Banks Criticizes The Women's March, Warns Women About Mainstream Feminism 
Azealia Banks is sounding off on social media again. And this time, she’s taken aim at Saturday’s Women’s March . We know. Take a deep breath. The controversial rapper went to Instagram on Sunday criticizing the recent demonstrations and the mission of mainstream feminism. Banks asked, “Why do women fall for these white feminist tricks all the time? Now that some white dude has taken office who simply said something silly about grabbing a p***y, they want to march in the streets under the guise of ‘standing up for human freedoms.’” The 25-year-old then claimed these marchers did not express the same concern when police officers were gunning down black people last year. She went on to say that white feminists demand the world’s support, but does not give that same support back. Banks, who has been a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump , said she has an optimistic outlook, and wants the country to “just chill.” She also used this opportunity to shamelessly plug her new music. “Let’s just keep calm and wait for new [Azealia Banks] music lol,” she wrote. “Cause I’m coming. V soon” You can read all her messages below.

The proof is in the pudding. Feminism only cares about and fights for white women. Feminism is basically white women protecting each other and keeping all other women out. Look at the numbers for that march, look how much power and strength white women have when they join together. White women could save the entire world if they TRULY wanted to but they don't. If Taylor swift said to vogue and told them to give equal opportunity to girls who don't fit the privileged white girl image what do you think would happen? DIVERSITY. If white women were on the front of americas race issue and actively worked to level the playing field - racism would be gone. That's is how much social power white women TRULY have. We don't have true diversity and transparency amongst women as a cornerstone of mainstream feminism because white women don't want it !! They like their power and want to keep it. It's dangerous to involve yourself and consume all these blanket statements about what women need deserve and want because the list of grievances doesn't TRULY represent all women. What a lot of mainstream feminism stands for is dangerous because you have these very privileged and entitled white women speaking on be half of all women and it shouldn't be.
