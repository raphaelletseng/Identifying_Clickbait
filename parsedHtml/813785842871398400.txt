The fabulous life of Dr. Dre, one of the wealthiest men in hip-hop


With an estimated net worth of $710 million, Dr. Dre is one of the wealthiest men in hip-hop. Only Diddy, with an estimated wealth of $735 million, is worth more.

According to Forbes, Dr. Dre earned a whopping $620 million before taxes in 2014, the biggest paycheck of any entertainer in history.Â

Apple acquired Beats Music and Beats Electronics, the music company Dre started with Jimmy Iovine in 2008, for $3 billion in May 2014.

Considering it's been over two years since Dr. Dre cashed in on the Beats deal, we thought it'd be fun to take a look at the fabulously wealthy rapper and how he spends his millions.Â
