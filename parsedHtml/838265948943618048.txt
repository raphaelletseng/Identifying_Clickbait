With fans everywhere waiting for the release of his upcoming album, Pure Comedy, Joshua Tillman a.k.a. Father John Misty took to the SNL stage to give the public a taste of what's to come on April 7.

Tillman released the title track for the new project back on Jan. 24, and the laid-back, piano-driven "Pure Comedy" landed on just about everyone's best new music lists (including ours).

Misty's delightfully weird sense of humor was on display in the promos he helped cut for this week's episode, where he spent most of his time lurking in the background and making faces:



The Maryland native has one of the most fascinating origin stories in the music business. Tillman spent his early 20s working at a Seattle bakery, and he used the time before his shifts started to record the demo that eventually got him put on. After a solo stint under his real name and time spent as the drummer for the Fleet Foxes, a Seattle folk rock outfit, Tillman was reborn under the Father John Misty moniker in 2012.

Ever since, Tillman has settled into a niche as a relentless satirist and cultural critic. Early in 2016, he dropped a hilarious series of rejected Pandora promos on his SoundCloud page, and he spent the majority of a festival set last summer explaining to his audience that "entertainment is stupid."
