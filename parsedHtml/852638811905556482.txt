Filipino Catholics perform gruesome religious rituals on the streets


Whipping their backs until they pour blood then nailing themselves to crosses, these are the Filipino Catholics who perform gruesome religious rituals to seek forgiveness for their sins.

Crowds of half-naked devotees took to the streets of Mandaluyong, east of Manila, on Thursday to perform acts of self-inflicted pain like flagellation and re-enactments of Christ's crucifixion in a show of faith.

The gory ritual is a tradition in small towns of the the primarily Catholic nation before Easter as a form of worship believed to cleanse the sins of the devotees, cure illnesses and even grant wishes.

Despite the Catholic Church strongly condemning the practice, large crowds of devotees and spectators including children could be seen lining the sun-drenched streets to watch the extreme form of worship.

Many Filipino Catholic penitents mark the Holy Week by submitting to different forms of physical penance in the hopes of being forgiven for their sins

A pair of masked devotes were seen sprawled on the road with bloody gashes on their back after being whipped by chains and bamboo sticks.

Other worshipers tied rope around their arms and legs then lacerated their backs with razorblades, before marching through sweltering 35 degree heat to pray at makeshift altars.

Men dressed as soldiers of the Roman Empire were also photographed hauling pitchforks to the grim Good Friday re-enactment outside a church.

Ritual crucifixions are the most extreme part of the ceremony, and are carried out on the belief Christ died for the salvation of humanity.

The nails impale the devotees hands and both, and they spend a few minutes on the cross before they are taken down to have their bloody wounds treated.

Over 80 percent Filipinos are Catholic, however as these confronting snapshots show, some of the nation's religious practices are a far cry from the traditional Roman Catholic observances of Holy Week.

Thousands of Jewish worshippers converge at the Western Wall in Jerusalem for Passover

Meanwhile, a very different religious ceremony was unfolding far afield in the Middle East.

An estimated 80,000 Jewish worshipers were photographed converging for a priestly blessing at the Western Wall of Jerusalem's Old City - the holiest site in the region.

Covered in prayer shawls, with their backs to the wall, male priests raised their hands and chanted the words of the blessing to the heaving crowds below.

In two separate ceremonies for men and women, heaving crowds spillled out from the wall's plaza to surrounding areas to partake in the holy event.

Many participants were ultra-Orthodox Jews in dark suits and hats, but representatives of other sides of Israeli society, as well as the occasional tourist, could be seen among the crowds.

The blessing is part of daily prayers chanted in synagogues worldwide, but since the early 1970s huge mass events are held on Passover, evoking the biblical dictum of pilgrimage to the temple in Jerusalem.

To members of Israel's small Ethiopian Jewish community, being near the site of the historic temples on Passover has special significance, with many having arrived from the African nation since the 1980s.

The Western Wall is a remnant of a supporting wall of the Second Temple complex, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.

Above it lies the plaza where the temple once stood and which now houses the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam.

It is the holiest site to Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.
