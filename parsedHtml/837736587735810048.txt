The White House tradition dates back to the early 19th century

Washington (CNN) Press secretary wasn't Sean Spicer's first White House job.

During George W. Bush's presidency, he took on the role of the Easter Bunny to entertain children at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.

Photos of Spicer wearing the fluffy, white costume resurfaced on social media this week as the Christian observance of Lent begins.

Spicer served as assistant United States trade representative for media and public affairs in the Bush administration.
