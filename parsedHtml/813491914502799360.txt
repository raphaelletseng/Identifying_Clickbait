Four men arrested in India after US tourist accuses them of gang rape

Updated

Indian police say they have arrested four men on suspicion of raping an American tourist who visited New Delhi earlier this year.

Police officer Rakesh Kumar said the suspects — a tour guide and his associate, a car driver and a hotel worker — were arrested on Monday.

The woman said in her police complaint that the four men raped her after she was drugged in a New Delhi hotel room in April.

They denied the accusations.

She also said the four men had shot a video of the attack and had threatened to make it public if she reported the matter to anyone, police said.

The woman went back to the US and registered a complaint through an email to New Delhi's police commissioner.

She returned to the Indian capital earlier this month to pursue the case because she was dissatisfied with the progress of the police investigation.

The Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency said the police did not arrest the four men earlier because the travel agency they worked for conducted an internal inquiry and cleared them.

The suspects also told investigators during questioning that the woman was trying to falsely implicate them because she had gone with them to Agra to see the Taj Mahal, the monument of love, a day after accusing them of the crime, PTI said.

India introduced tougher laws against sexual assault following the December 2012 death of a young woman who was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi.

In June, five men were convicted of the 2014 gang rape of a Danish tourist.

It is estimated a woman is raped every 20 minutes in India.
