Ra-ra-ah-ah-ah: The 7 Best Lady Gaga Songs for Karaoke  by   FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS  Grab a friend, warm up the pipes and dust off your wigs, because it’s Lady Gaga karaoke time! The weather’s getting colder and all of a sudden, a night out at a karaoke bar is a lot more alluring than it was back in June. And -- in the rare chance you haven’t heard by now -- it’s also Lady Gaga season. Gaga’s new album dropped today (Oct. 21), and with a Super Bowl performance and likely world tour on the horizon, expect to hear plenty more from Mother Monster in the months to come. When you reach for that hefty, beer-coated book of karaoke songs, might we suggest some Gaga? From vocal runs to “rahs,” here are the seven Lady Gaga songs guaranteed to kill it in any crowd. Good luck! The music video is iconic, but trust us: The song holds up just as much. Whether you want to tackle it alone, or bring up a friend to cameo during the BeyoncÃ© guest verse -- which always recommends -- “Telephone” is a good (ahem) call. Plus, as far as classic Gaga songs go, it’s not too challenging for amateur singers. And you can razz audience members who keep their phones during your song. Always a plus! This is a song you have to nail, and any karaoke veteran knows it. Missing your years of choir practice? Want to flex on the crowd? Has someone already snatched "At Last," your usual go-to? Take a deep breath and go for it. Just think about the last few verses! When the backing track drops out and it’s just the “Born this way” harmony, you can work the crowd and get them clapping for you like the diva you are. It’s a song made for showcasing full-on pop star dreams. Other jams with a “Born This Way” vibe: fellow singles “Marry The Night” and “Edge of Glory.”  If ballads are your thing, “Paparazzi” is the ideal choice from the Gaga catalog. Sure, there are more dramatic ones. And there’s the album of standards she did with Tony Bennett . But “Paparazzi” is special. You can croon. You can sing your big heart out. And by the breakdown, LOOK OUT! You’re also rapping. Much like “Telephone,” “Poker Face” is an A+ choice for karaoke fans of all stripes. It has instant recognition (that intro!) and an irresistible hook. Even if you feel like a karaoke novice, “Poker Face” will make it easy; keep up with the beat and you’re pretty much set. Expect the audience to chime in for the chorus -- and if you want to bring up a pal to help out with the “I won’t tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you, ‘cause I’m bluffin’” bridge, it’s a guaranteed smash.  A choice from Gaga’s new album may seem bold, but a good karaoke crowd appreciates a risk. People go crazy for performers that surprise them, so conjure up an emotional memory and you tell that audience about what a “perfect illuuuusiiiiionnn” it was. This particular track requires some vocal power, so if you’ve had a shot or two and you’re ready to crush a solo performance, queue up the and do your thing. When we discuss Gaga’s best tracks, “The Fame” gets lost in the shuffle, and that’s a shame. It’s super fun! If you’re looking for an earlier song, “The Fame” gives you a lot to work with. The verses themselves are short and easy to work with -- “All we care about is/ runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles” rolls right off the tongue – and the chorus is upbeat and repetitive. It’ll be easy for you to go full ‘90s with hand movements too; you don’t need to look at a screen to remember lines like “Fame, fame, we live for the fame.”  FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS

Grab a friend, warm up the pipes and dust off your wigs, because it’s Lady Gaga karaoke time!

The weather’s getting colder and all of a sudden, a night out at a karaoke bar is a lot more alluring than it was back in June. And -- in the rare chance you haven’t heard by now -- it’s also Lady Gaga season. Gaga’s new album Joanne dropped today (Oct. 21), and with a Super Bowl performance and likely world tour on the horizon, expect to hear plenty more from Mother Monster in the months to come. When you reach for that hefty, beer-coated book of karaoke songs, might we suggest some Gaga?

From vocal runs to “rahs,” here are the seven Lady Gaga songs guaranteed to kill it in any crowd. Good luck!

1. “Telephone” The music video is iconic, but trust us: The song holds up just as much. Whether you want to tackle it alone, or bring up a friend to cameo during the BeyoncÃ© guest verse -- which Billboard always recommends -- “Telephone” is a good (ahem) call. Plus, as far as classic Gaga songs go, it’s not too challenging for amateur singers. And you can razz audience members who keep their phones during your song. Always a plus!

2. “Bad Romance” An obvious choice, but that doesn’t make it a bad one. From the moment people hear the intro, they perk up -- everyone knows what’s coming. You can vamp your way through the “Gaga ooh la las,” unleash some alien extraterrestrial moves from the video, and get everyone to sing along when the chorus explodes. Feel like belting? “Bad Romance” is for you. Bonus points if your French enunciation is on point by the bridge.

3. “Born This Way” This is a song you have to nail, and any karaoke veteran knows it. Missing your years of choir practice? Want to flex on the crowd? Has someone already snatched "At Last," your usual go-to? Take a deep breath and go for it. Just think about the last few verses! When the backing track drops out and it’s just the “Born this way” harmony, you can work the crowd and get them clapping for you like the diva you are. It’s a song made for showcasing full-on pop star dreams.

Other jams with a “Born This Way” vibe: fellow BTW singles “Marry The Night” and “Edge of Glory.”

4. “Paparazzi” If ballads are your thing, “Paparazzi” is the ideal choice from the Gaga catalog. Sure, there are more dramatic ones. And there’s the album of standards she did with Tony Bennett. But “Paparazzi” is special. You can croon. You can sing your big heart out. And by the breakdown, LOOK OUT! You’re also rapping.

5. “Poker Face” Much like “Telephone,” “Poker Face” is an A+ choice for karaoke fans of all stripes. It has instant recognition (that intro!) and an irresistible hook. Even if you feel like a karaoke novice, “Poker Face” will make it easy; keep up with the beat and you’re pretty much set. Expect the audience to chime in for the chorus -- and if you want to bring up a pal to help out with the “I won’t tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you, ‘cause I’m bluffin’” bridge, it’s a guaranteed smash.

6. “Perfect Illusion” A choice from Gaga’s new album Joanne may seem bold, but a good karaoke crowd appreciates a risk. People go crazy for performers that surprise them, so conjure up an emotional memory and you tell that audience about what a “perfect illuuuusiiiiionnn” it was. This particular track requires some vocal power, so if you’ve had a shot or two and you’re ready to crush a solo performance, queue up the Joanne and do your thing.

7. “The Fame” When we discuss Gaga’s best tracks, “The Fame” gets lost in the shuffle, and that’s a shame. It’s super fun! If you’re looking for an earlier song, “The Fame” gives you a lot to work with.
