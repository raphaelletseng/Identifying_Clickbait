A Thai man had a lucky escape when he fell 32 foot from his balcony onto a metal spike after he slipped trying to hang up his towel after a shower.

Patirat Punudom, 35, finished showering at 2am on Friday and climbed onto the second floor balcony ledge to hang his towel on a washing line.

The metal tip narrowly missed his penis and went seven-inches deep into his abdomen meaning the spike could be seen pressing against his skin from the inside.
