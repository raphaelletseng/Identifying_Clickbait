How times have changed.

Virtually no topics were out of bounds, as roast-master MacFarlane led celebrities in poking fun at the now president-elect over his multiple wives, the inheritance he received from his father and his mispronunciation of the word “huge.”

“I remember, he would nod and go ‘fair enough,’” said MacFarlane, whose show has repeatedly mocked Trump.

But now, the president-elect is known for fighting back when criticized, MacFarlane acknowledged.

“Now it’s not the same, now it’s different,” MacFarlane said. Trump’s skin had now “gotten a little thinner,” he said.

Trump could be more sensitive after standing in front of crowds who’d deified him over the past 18 months, MacFarlane suggested. “It’s gonna turn anybody into a madman,” he added.
