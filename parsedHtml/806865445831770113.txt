German Curve Steepens Most Since 2008 as ECB Tweaks QE: Chart
The German yield curve steepened the most in eight years as the European Central Bank unveiled changes to its asset-purchase plan. Shorter-dated bonds climbed as President Mario Draghi said the central bank would buy notes yielding below its minus 0.4 percent deposit rate, while longer-dated bonds dropped as the ECB said purchases would be tapered to 60 billion euros a month from April, compared with 80 billion euros now.
