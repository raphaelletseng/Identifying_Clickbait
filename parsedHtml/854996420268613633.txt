John Clarke's final curtain call as last Clarke and Dawe episode released

Updated

The final episode in the decades-long satirical Clarke and Dawe series has been released, following the sudden death of John Clarke earlier this month.

The previously unseen sketch was filmed at the ABC in Southbank on April 5, only days before Clarke died while bushwalking in Victoria.

It has been released with the permission of Clarke's family and his long-time collaborator, Bryan Dawe.

Clarke always wrote two completely different scripts for the program each week, and he and Dawe would film both.

Clarke would then decide which episode would go to air.

In this final episode, Clarke plays a National Broadband Network employee discussing neologisms.

"A neologism, Bryan, is simply a term, or a word, or a phrase which has come into the language fairly recently," Clarke says.

Dawe asks: "Like what?"

Clarke replies: "Well, 100 years ago the term psychology was very, very new."

"Is there a modern example?" Dawe asks.

Clarke replies: "A modern example from social media would be say something like Brangelina."

Former ABC US correspondent Ben Knight, who began producing Clarke and Dawe this year, said the second taping each week would sometimes be a work in progress.

"John might work on a new idea which he would form over several weeks. It was like a first draft he would develop," he said.

Since his death, fellow actors, comedians and politicians have paid tribute to Clarke, hailing him as one of the best satirists Australia has ever seen.

Dawe spoke about the rhythm the pair had producing the weekly series.

"I could pick up his script and I knew where all the beats were," he said last week.
