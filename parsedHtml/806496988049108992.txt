Pakistani pop star Junaid Jamshed was among those on board, his manager says

Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) All 47 people on board the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight that crashed near Abbottabad were killed, the airline said.

A pilot made a mayday call, saying he had lost control of one of the two engines, PIA Chairman Azam Saigol said.

"We were confident that the plane could land with one working engine," Saigol said. "This is a tragedy. We are not absolving ourselves of any connection to this incident."

Saigol said it's "highly unlikely that this was a terrorist attack." He added that the bodies of the victims would be transferred to hospitals in Islamabad at 12:30 p.m. local time.

500,000 rupees ($5,000) cash will be given to the next of kin of the 47 victims to meet funeral expenses, according to a statement released by PIA Thursday.
