What Intelligence Agencies Concluded About the Russian Attack on the U.S. Election
A strong statement from three intelligence agencies. • In unequivocal language, the report pins responsibility for the election attack directly on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, ruling out the possibility that it was ordered by intelligence officials or simply carried out by Kremlin supporters. • United States officials believe Mr. Putin wants to damage the image of American democracy to make it less attractive to Russians and their neighbors. _____ Russia took sides in the U.S. election. • Notably, the report concludes that Russia sought not only to damage Hillary Clinton, whom it thought likely to win, but actually tried to help elect Donald J. Trump. Advertisement • The C.I.A., F.B.I. and N.S.A. agreed on nearly everything in the report, but here we see that the N.S.A. was less certain than the other agencies that Russia was trying to help Mr. Trump. _____ Putin saw this attack as payback. • An important insight into Mr. Putin’s thinking: He already blamed the United States for multiple campaigns against Russia, including the release of the Panama Papers , showing offshore accounts hiding the fortunes of some of his closest friends and allies, and the exposure of Russian athletes for doping. For him, this was payback. • There is no evidence suggesting that the United States government had a role in releasing the Panama Papers, and while American officials complained of Russian doping, there is no basis to suggest that they fabricated evidence of it. _____ Putin held a grudge against Clinton. • The election attack was personal, the report concludes: Mr. Putin thought Mrs. Clinton had insulted him and encouraged demonstrations against him in Russia. _____ Trump’s business background appealed to Putin. • A new observation: Mr. Putin has enjoyed close relations with some Western leaders who had personal business ties to Russia. The report suggests he may have seen Mr. Trump in a similar light, though the Trump Organization has no major projects in Russia. _____ The election attack was part of a larger campaign. • While the intelligence agencies see the leak of hacked materials to influence the election as “unprecedented,” they view it as part of a familiar Russian information strategy using every form of contemporary media to influence public opinion. _____ The hacking was done by Russian intelligence. • The report’s most specific finding on hacking tracks with what cybersecurity experts have said: that two different hacking groups attacked Democratic targets, one described here as “Russian intelligence,” the other more specifically as the G.R.U., Russian military intelligence. • Contrary to expectations, the report says nothing about the forensic analysis or American spying on which the conclusions are based. Advertisement _____ The key was not hacking but leaking. • Here the report accuses the Russian government of going beyond standard cyberespionage, in which hacking is used to get information, to an attack by releasing the information to influence the election. • As expected, the agencies accuse the G.R.U. of being behind Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.com , two outlets that released hacked emails and documents, and with supplying hacked emails to WikiLeaks, though it does not suggest WikiLeaks editors necessarily knew the source. _____ Evidence that Russia was happy Trump won. • The report cites positive Russian news coverage of Mr. Trump’s victory as confirmation that Mr. Putin’s government took sides in the election. • In the agencies’ view, the Russian government sees Mr. Trump’s victory as one in a series of wins for populist movements championed by Mr. Putin. _____ This will happen again. • The report suggests that Mr. Putin believes the combination of hacking and leaks is a low-risk, high-impact way to influence other countries — and that Russia is likely to keep trying the same methods against the United States and other countries.
