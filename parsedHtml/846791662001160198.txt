Their names had cropped up during the probe by Thane police in the Rs 2,000 crore drug bust. They were arrested in November 2014 in a sting operation by US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officers posing as Colombian drug dealers. Goswami and his aides were accused of conspiring to ship at least 98 kg of high-grade heroin and methamphetamine to the US.

On April 14, the Thane crime branch seized over 20 tonnes of ephedrine and 2.5 tonnes of acetic anhydride, both banned party drugs from a pharmaceutical factory in Solapur and other locations in Thane and Mumbai. Investigations led the sleuths to the involvement of Goswami and Kenyan based international drug mafia involved in the racket.

In September 2016, a battery of legal hawks, some from abroad, refuted the involvement of Mamta in the case.

Mukhi had earlier testified before a magistrate court but later turned the tables that his confession was under pressure from investigators.
