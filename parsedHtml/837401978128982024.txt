Here's Rihanna's Next Puma Collaboration


The successful Rihanna x Puma range will continue with the release of these bow-anchored styles. The sneaker and the slide are both listed now at Euro retailer Asphalt Gold as coming soon, and Puma's own website promises a pre-release on March 9 at 10 a.m. EST.

The sneaker silhouette included looks rather like the Puma R698, although its upper isn't a one-to-one match, with some lines left out on this version.

Both pairs come under Rihanna's Fenty label with Puma, which has been the source of successful styles like her platform Creepers. It's also been the source of bizarre creations like this.

Rihanna signed with Puma in December, 2014, becoming the creative director of their women's line.
