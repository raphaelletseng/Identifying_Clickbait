MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Vikings' talks about a restructured contract for running back Adrian Peterson aren't likely to pick up steam until around the NFL scouting combine in the beginning of March, and it remains possible the team will work out a deal to keep him in Minnesota in 2017.

Peterson has said publicly he wants to return to the Vikings next season, and those close to him believe the same thing. He turns 32 in March and ran for only 72 yards in three games of a season during which he was recovering from a torn meniscus. Still, he could return next season if he finds common ground with the Vikings as they pursue a reworked deal in lieu of an option that would pay Peterson $18 million (including a $6 million roster bonus).

Still, this being a business, it's entirely possible Peterson and the Vikings will part ways at the start of the league year, March 9, rather than work out a deal to keep him in Minnesota. Peterson acknowledged as much during an appearance on ESPN's First Take last month, when he said, "I see myself in purple," before adding, "A lot has to take place," and naming the New York Giants, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Houston Texans as teams he has considered as possibilities should he not be back with the Vikings next season.

The list of possibilities for Peterson is probably longer than those three teams, but if he did become a free agent, it would take the right set of circumstances -- a team close to winning, a role at running back and possibly a personal connection -- for him to land there. Here's a look at some of the places Peterson could end up, some more realistic than others.

Adrian Peterson could be a fit in New York if the Giants look to upgrade a rushing attack that ranked 29th in 2016. Jerry Lai/US Presswire

New York Giants

Running back situation: Rashad Jennings, 31, led the Giants with 593 rushing yards, and Paul Perkins, 22, had 456. Jennings was released on Tuesday, and though Perkins showed promise, he didn't score a touchdown last season.

Projected cap space: $31.03 million

Could it work? The Giants went 11-5 with the league's 29th-ranked running game and the second-shortest average drive in the league. The idea of playing in a backfield with Eli Manning and in an offense with Odell Beckham Jr. could be intriguing to Peterson, though a team that threw nearly 600 times last season isn't about to become a ball-control outfit. Still, there could be a fit here if the Giants think Peterson can help put them over the top.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Running back situation: Jacquizz Rodgers led the team in rushing with 560 yards, but he's a free agent. Doug Martin and his $7 million cap hit could also be on the way out after a violation for performance-enhancing drugs last season. Charles Sims, who played only seven games in 2016, is in the final year of his contract.

Projected cap space: $65.65 million
