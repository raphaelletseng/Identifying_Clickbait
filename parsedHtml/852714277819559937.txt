He won the Georgia Science and Engineering Fair for his project

(CNN) At 12 years old, Steven Litt has discovered cancer-fighting chemicals in green tea.

The middle schooler's project for the Georgia Science and Engineering Fair used an antioxidant in green tea to fight cancer growth in worms. It's won prizes across the state and gained attention from researchers nationwide.

Stephen, who lives outside of Atlanta, Georgia, became interested in cancer-related research after two family friends were diagnosed with breast cancer. He immediately began reading up on cancer, and found an article about decreased rates of the disease in Japan in connection with the antioxidants in green tea.
