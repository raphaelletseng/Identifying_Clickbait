Russian Military Plane Crashes into Sea Shortly after takeoff on Sunday morning, a Russian military plane carrying 92 people crashed into the Black Sea near Sochi.      SOCHI, Russia — A Russian aircraft bound for Syria carrying a famed military band to entertain Russia’s forces there crashed into the Black Sea moments after takeoff on Sunday, and the authorities said all 92 people aboard were believed dead. The cause of the crash is under investigation, although initial Russian news media reports indicated it was a technical failure rather than terrorism. The Russian military has had only minor casualties throughout its deployment in Syria, but the country has experienced a series of setbacks in recent days. On Monday, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated at an art exhibit in Ankara, with the killer yelling, “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria !” Advertisement That came not long after forces from the Islamic State recaptured the storied Syrian city of Palmyra , forcing the Russian garrison that had been stationed there since helping to take the city last spring to flee.

He also ordered Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev to establish a state commission, headed by the transportation minister, Maxim Sokolov, to investigate the crash.
