Do you have experience putting together pitch decks? Are you familiar with writing proposals? Do you have dreams of working with one of the biggest names in music? Then you need to go to Chance the Rapper ’s Twitter page, like, right now. I'm looking for an intern, someone with experience in putting together decks and writing proposals I want intern resumes formatted as creative decks, pitches or proposals ctrinternsubmissions@gmail.com https://t.co/p7aRGv4gwn On Monday, the Chicago artist/philanthropist went to Twitter looking for an intern with a specific set of skills. The tweet didn’t provide many details and, therefore, was met with several big questions: What kind of projects will the intern work on? Is the gig paid? Can the intern receive college credit? Despite the vagueness of the position, fans rushed to submit their candidacy—many of whom confused pitch decks (visual presentations that sell a product, service, etc.) with the backyard structures. @chancetherapper the Internet (myself included): "yes here yes hello yes decks I know decks I have decks front decks back decks all decks" pic.twitter.com/9qFbMfjcyV @chancetherapper savittjh@gmail.com in 4th grade I helped my friend get his parents to buy a swimming pool by making a powerpoint @chancetherapper  pic.twitter.com/xyvZyYYE1R @chancetherapper  @TrinidadJamis0n  pic.twitter.com/X3oO9LPCwE @chancetherapper I helped my dad build the back porch and he said I was "a wizard with a power sander" so I might be of a little assistance @chancetherapper this is my résumé.

Earlier this month, the rapper donated $1 million to Chicago Public Schools . The contribution was to help the school system’s $215 million budget shortage. “This isn't about politics, this isn't about posturing,” Chance said during a speech at Westcott Elementary. “This is about taking care of the kids.”
