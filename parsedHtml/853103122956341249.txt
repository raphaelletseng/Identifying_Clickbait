20 Years After Her Death, Princess Diana Remembered With A Memorial Garden
20 Years After Her Death, Princess Diana Remembered With A Memorial Garden To commemorate Princess Diana's 20th death anniversary, Kensington Palace’s historic Sunken Garden was planted with 12,000 bulbs last autumn. The 'White Garden' will be seen in full bloom this May. The garden celebrates Diana's 'elegance, vivacity and style'. It was planted with Diana's favourite blossoms - white tulips, scented hyacinths and daffodils, and white forget-me-nots. And the blossoms have been planted by Diana's gardeners who still remember the princess's fondness for the spot. The memorial garden has been opened ahead of Diana's 20th death anniversary at her former home where her sons Prince Harry and Prince George and his family now live. Entry for visitors is open and free. They will be able to enjoy the blossoms from a public walkway all through till September.
