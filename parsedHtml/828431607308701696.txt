Fans who stood front and center on the field waved wands of light with synchronized choreography, making Gaga appear like the general of a dance army. A fireworks display erupted following her high-octane performance. With her trio of wardrobe changes, Gaga's dynamic versatility on the stage made her somewhat like Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan during the match-up: the real MVP. WOW.
