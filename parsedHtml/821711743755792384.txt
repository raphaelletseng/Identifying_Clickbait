Mads told that he was “a dancer out of coincidence, a little like I became an actor out of coincidence.” “I was a gymnast as a kid, and there was a choreographer who went out and saw us … they needed somebody in the background to do jumps and flips and shit.” “I did the math: there were a lot of really hot chicks, and not a lot of boys around.” “I stayed with that for a while, eight or nine years.” Eight or nine years done right!
