Two smoke bombs have been set off in St Mark's Square in Venice - reportedly by thieves targeting a jewellery store.

Tourists and shop staff are said to have panicked, suspecting a fire or a possible attack.

A witness at an outdoor cafe apparently alerted police - but the would-be thieves disappeared into the crowd.
