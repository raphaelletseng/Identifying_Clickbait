Elton John recovering from 'potentially deadly' bacterial infection; cancels string of concerts

Updated

Elton John has spent two nights in intensive care with a potentially deadly bacterial infection and cancelled all his concerts for the rest of April and May, his publicist said.

The British musician, 70, became "violently ill" on a flight home from his recent South American tour, spokeswoman Fran Curtis said in a statement.

The Rocket Man singer spent two nights in intensive care in the UK and is resting at home after being released on Saturday, the statement said.

The infection was not identified, but the statement said John contracted the "harmful and unusual bacterial infection" during his South American tour, which ended in Chile on April 10.

"Infections of this nature are rare and potentially deadly," the statement said, adding that his time in intensive care was followed by an "extended stay in hospital".

John is expected to make a full recovery but has cancelled all his concerts in Las Vegas for April and May, as well as a gig in Bakersfield, California, on May 6.

John apologised to fans for disappointing them, adding in a statement: "I am extremely grateful to the medical team for their excellence in looking after me so well."

He is due to resume performances in Twickenham, England, on June 3.

John, a Grammy, Oscar and Tony winner for his work in film and theatre, is working on a score for a Broadway musical adaptation of the comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada.
