The Beatles ' "Come Together" became one of the band's final No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 when it topped the chart for a week in October 1969 (the 18th of their record 20 No. 1s, to be exact). Now, nearly half a century later, the song continues to find new life, thanks to a cover that's emerged on rock radio. On the Mainstream Rock Songs airplay chart dated April 8, Godsmack 's take on "Come Together" debuts at No. 33, sporting a 123 percent gain in airplay in the week ending March 26, according to Nielsen Music. Not bad for a song originally released in 2012; as previously reported , the remake resurfaced following a post on the website that went viral, allowing the cover to leap to No. 1 on the Hard Rock Digital Song Sales chart dated March 18 with 11,000 downloads sold. Interestingly, "Come Together" joins Mainstream Rock Songs as one of two covers of hits on the chart this week. Halestorm's "Still of the Night," a redo of Whitesnake's No. 18-peaking Mainstream Rock Songs hit in 1987, slots in at No. 27 (after hitting No. 20). Additionally, Otep's rendition of Lorde's "Royals" peaked at No. 39 earlier this year, while 2016 was highlighted by Disturbed's cover of Simon & Garfunkel's "The Sound of Silence," a seven-week No. 1, plus a brief appearance for Chris Cornell's cover of the Prince-penned, Sinead O'Connor-popularized "Nothing Compares 2 U" (No. 34).
