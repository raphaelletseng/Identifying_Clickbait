Hilarious pictures capture utterly baffling photo shoots


We all have cringe-worthy pictures we would rather keep tucked away.

So spare a thought for these unfortunate souls whose most embarrassing photos have become viral sensations after being posted in an online gallery.

The pictures capture men, women and children in a series of hilarious, provocative and downright baffling poses as they push the boundaries on camera.

While props can bring a little something to photo shoots, it is unclear what these would-be models were aiming for with their swords, guns and parrots.

Nudity also seemed to be the order of the day for many, with a number of women stripping off as they smiled and pouted for the camera.

Perhaps the most bizarre of them all is one of a naked man emerging from the petals of a tulip, proving that being creative does not always pay off.

Here, FEMAIL rounds up some of the most baffling photos to emerge online.
