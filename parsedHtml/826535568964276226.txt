Bob Dylan is continuing his album-per-year streak in 2017, this time with three LPs at once.

The legendary singer-songwriter revealed Tuesday (Jan. 31) that he will be releasing a three-disc studio album titled Triplicate on March 31, which follow up the 2015 release Shadows in the Night and 2016's Fallen Angels. The tri-disc set will feature 30 "brand-new recordings of classic American tunes," according to a press release.

All three discs of Triplicate will be individually titled (‘Til The Sun Goes Down, Devil Dolls and Comin’ Home Late), with each including a thematically arranged 10-song sequence. Although this marks Dylan's 38th album release, Triplicate will be the first triple-length set of his career.
