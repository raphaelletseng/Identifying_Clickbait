27 stunning images that were taken by Google Street View


Since 2007, Google Street View has taken panoramic shots of 5 million miles of roads, covering 45 countries and about 3,000 cities around the world.

Canadian artist and filmmaker Jon RafmanÂ has spent many hours culling through these images. He takes screen shots ofÂ the best ones and displays them on his blog (though never revealsÂ their location). Called "9-Eyes," his Tumblr is named after the nine cameras that Google's Street View cars use.

The photos portray how weird and beautiful the world looks. Take a look at some of our favorites.
