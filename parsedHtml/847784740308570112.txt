LeBron James Appears to Take a Jab at Lonzo Ball Before Game Against Bulls
LeBron James Appears to Take a Jab at Lonzo Ball Before Game Against Bulls
Early last week, LeBron James was involved in a brief war of words with LaVar Ball over some comments that LaVar made about LeBronâ€™s sons. LaVar told Fox Sports 1â€™s Chris Broussard that he feels like his sons are betterÂ set up for long-term success than LeBronâ€™s sons, and LeBron didnâ€™t appreciate him mentioning his kids . "Keep my kidsâ€™ names out of your mouth,"Â LeBron said in response. "Keep my family out of your mouth. This is dad to dad. Itâ€™s a problem nowâ€¦He can talk all about his brand, talk about his sons, talk about basketball, talk about me. But keep my family out of this." LaVar responded by, well, talking about LeBronâ€™s kids again . During an interview on SiriusXMâ€™s , he accused LeBron of being too "touchy" and reiterated that he doesnâ€™t think either of LeBronâ€™s kids are going to have the same type of success that LeBron has had in the NBA. LeBron refused to get into a back-and-forth with LaVar, but on Thursday night, he seemed to throw a little bit of shade in the direction of LaVarâ€™s son Lonzo , who just finished up his freshman season with UCLA and is headed to the NBA this summer. While warming up for a game against the Bulls, LeBron appeared to do an impersonation of Lonzoâ€™s unconventional shot before smirking as if to say, "You guys just saw that, right?"

Lebron is petty for mocking Lonzo's Shot ðŸ˜‚ Lmao lebron is a savage he imitated Lonzo Ball's jumpshot in warm ups ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ LeBron shot like Lonzo Ball????? Oooooooh petty After watching Lebron imitate Lonzo's shot, I've officially jumped on the Lebron bandwagon and I'm not ashamed. Skip Bayless even found a way to criticize LeBron for it: Isn't it beneath LeBron's "best in the world" dignity to take a literal shot at Lonzo Ball by mocking his shooting stroke? He's just a kid. The Cavaliers ended up losing to the Bulls 99-93, so LeBron didnâ€™t speak about the shade after the game. But if he was, in fact, poking fun at Lonzoâ€™s shooting form, he proved once again that petty LeBron is the best LeBron .
