Children across the United Kingdom have ditched conventional egg dying in favor of immortalizing their favorite singer in their Easter baskets.

Ed Sheeran, who is currently topping the UK and Ireland singles and albums charts with Divide and "Shape Of You," has been chosen as the muse for many egg projects. Parents have eagerly shown their children's masterpieces on Twitter and they are eerily similar to the singer.

The projects feature Sheeran, as an egg, singing on stage, playing his guitar, and having very real hair.
