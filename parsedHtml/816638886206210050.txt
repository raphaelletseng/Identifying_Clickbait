Volvo loses its place as Sweden’s top-selling car


Volvo has lost its place as Sweden’s best-selling car - for the first time in more than half a century.

Instead the Volkswagen Golf topped sales, according to the country’s carmakers’ association.

The Golf made up 5.9 per cent of new cars bought in the country, while Volvo’s V70, S90 and V90 constituted 5.7 per cent. It’s not the first time the brand has been knocked off the top spot by a VW.

In 1962 it was beaten by the Volkswagen Beetle, which ceased manufacturing in 2003.

Volvo, which was sold to Chinese firm Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 2010, is still viewed as an iconic Swedish brand.

As a company, it registered more than 71,000 cars in Sweden last year – well ahead of Volkswagen’s 58,000 – with four of its models dominating the top six.

But its V70, the most popular car in Sweden for the past two decades, has ceased production in favour of the newer V90 model.
