What the man who went through the most complicated face transplant ever looks like one year later


In 2001, former fireman Patrick Hardison was trapped in a house fire in Senatobia, Mississippi. He suffered extensive burns to his face, losing his ears and eyelids. On August 14, 2015, doctors at NYU Langone completed the most complex face transplant to date.
