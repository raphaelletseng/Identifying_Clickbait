A woman has been charged with the murder of a mother whose body was found on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula more than six months after she went missing.

Joanne Martell, 45, was reported missing by relatives in May last year.

Her body was found by detectives in bushland near Sorrento in January after they received a tip off from the public.

A week earlier, police said the 45-year-old had not been seen since she dropped her dog off at a friend's house.

Ms Martell had a teenage daughter and a son in her 20s, and lived a transient lifestyle around the Rosebud and Dromana area.

Homicide Squad detectives have now charged a 42-year-old woman from Ravenhall, in Melbourne's west, with one count of murder.

Police said she would appear at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court later today.
