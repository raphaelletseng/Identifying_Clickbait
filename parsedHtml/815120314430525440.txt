FinTech 50 2016: The Future Of Your Money


Well, 2016 ended on quite a scandalous note for Shraddha Kapoor. First, the rumours of her moving in with alleged beau Farhan Akhtar broke and as expected it took the internet by storm. Soon after, the news of Shakti Kapoor dragging her out from Farhan’s home started doing the rounds. However, daddy Kapoor cleared the air and rubbished all the rumours of Shraddha dating the Rock On actor.

This should have sufficed but then Shraddha herself has now come out to address the rumours of her live-in relationship with Akhtar.

In an interview with Bombay Times, she said,

“I got a message from someone telling me about this article, and initially, I was amused. While it doesn’t make a difference to me because I know it’s not true, it’s sad that these false stories go so far that people forget we are human, too. Of course, we are actors and there will be people who would probably want to read something gossipy about us, but when it involves my father, my aunt and my co-star, it’s taking it too far.”

Then she made it absolutely clear that she has no intentions of moving out of her parents’ home anytime soon,

“Yes, I am living in… with my parents! I was born and brought up in this house. It’s a joke within the family that I will bring my husband home (laughs). It’s because I’m so happy living with my family . I have a house of my own where I have my meetings and keep my extra stuff. I have no intention of moving out of my parents’ home and moving into my own apartment, let alone someone else’s! About live-in relationships in general, I believe in live and let live. If it suits somebody and someone is happy , then it’s totally fine -to each his own.”

Looks like the cat is finally out of the bag, fellas!
