Stephen Gay, Queensland Government staffer, quits after refusing police breath test

Updated

A senior Palaszczuk Government staffer and political hopeful has quit after failing to provide a breath specimen to Queensland police.

Stephen Gay resigned as chief of staff to Public Works Minister Mick de Brenni following the incident, which is understood to have happened on Friday night.

In October, Mr Gay, who was then working for the Innovation Minister, revealed to the ABC he was intending to seek ALP preselection for the seat of Mansfield in south-eastern Brisbane.

A spokesman for Mr de Brenni said the Minister had accepted the resignation of his chief of staff, effective immediately.

Mr Gay had been working in Mr de Brenni's office for less than two months.

Mr Gay said he had been parked on the side of the road for 20 minutes to take work phone calls and send texts, and declined to take a breath test because he was not driving at the time.
