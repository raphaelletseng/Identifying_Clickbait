Troubled startup Magic Leap loses another top executive


Magic Leap's head of PR and communications, Andy Fouche, is leaving the troubled startup.Â

His departure was announced the week after a bombshell report in The Information said that the secretive Dania Beach, Florida-based startup was exaggerating its technology in demo videos and that it has generally oversold its progress towards a pair of smart glasses.Â

Fouche will join Android inventor Andy Rubin's new stealth startup, he announced in a tweet.

Magic Leap confirmed Fouche's departure toÂ Business Insider in a statement:Â

"Andy Fouche will no longer serve as VP of Public Relations for Magic Leap, Inc. As we sprint full steam ahead toward the launch of Magic Leap One, we are excited to have Brenda Freeman on board as our Chief Marketing Officer. We are creatively aligned, she has already brought fresh energy, excitement, unbounded joy and opportunity to those who choose to play on our team."

By our count, Fouche is at least the fourth VP-or-higher level executive to leave Magic Leap in 2016.

Gary Bradski, Senior Vice President of Advanced Perception and Intelligence, and founder of Magic Leap's first West Coast office, left Magic Leap in early 2016 to found a now-defunct robotics startup.Â

Adrian Kaehler, VP of Technology Solutions, left along with Bradski. The two later sued Magic Leap for wrongful termination .Â

Brian Wallace, chief marketing officer, left in October

And now Fouche, who was the head of communications.Â
