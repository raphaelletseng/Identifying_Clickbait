A Pair of Classic Rock Events Will Bring Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles to the Coasts
A Pair of Classic Rock Events Will Bring Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles to the Coasts
As the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney and the Who took the stage last fall at the Desert Trip festival in Southern California, Mick Fleetwood was in the stands, loving every minute of it. “I was there like a stalker fan,” Mr. Fleetwood said. “And it was so cool! It was emotionally charged.” This summer Mr. Fleetwood, the drummer and founding member of Fleetwood Mac, will have something of a classic-rock festival of his own, with a pair of two-day concerts set for Los Angeles and New York, featuring Fleetwood Mac; the Eagles; Steely Dan; the Doobie Brothers; Journey; and Earth, Wind and Fire. The first two shows, called “The Classic West,” will be held at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on July 15 and 16; the second, “The Classic East,” will be at Citi Field on July 29 and 30, with the same lineup. “Seeing people of every age group really going at it and being supercharged, it was a trip,” Mr. Fleetwood said, calling from Maui, where he lives. “And that’s what we’ve been touching on.” For Fleetwood Mac fans, the shows have another attraction: They will feature Christine McVie, who rejoined the group in 2014 after an absence of 16 years, reviving its classic lineup of the mid-1970s and ’80s: Stevie Nicks, Ms. McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, John McVie and Mr. Fleetwood. The scale and success of both Desert Trip and “ Fare Thee Well ,” a series of concerts by the reunited Grateful Dead, opened the music industry’s eyes to the possibilities of adapting the festival model for an older, more moneyed audience. Desert Trip, whose lineup also included Roger Waters, Bob Dylan and Neil Young, sold $160 million in tickets, and “Fare Thee Well,” in 2015, sold $52 million and led to a tour. The “Classic West” and “Classic East” concerts — the organizers are not using the term festival, since the shows are taking place in urban stadiums with no room for Ferris wheels or chill-out tents — are the latest iteration of this phenomenon, and have been the worst-kept secret of the music world, with most details leaking early this month.
