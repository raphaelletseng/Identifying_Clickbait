Mariah Carey turned her disastrous New Year’s Eve performance into a win with a single tweet. Whether you watched it live last night, or you’re waking up to the news this morning, you’ve probably already heard that the singer’s hotly anticipated performance on ABC's annual New Year's Rockin' Eve showcase went horribly awry.

But, when you have the second most number one hits in Billboard history, as Carey does, you’re allowed to brush off a public catasrophe in one fell tweet. “Shit happens," she tweeted early Sunday. "Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here's to making more headlines in 2017.”

"Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances," said Nicole Perna, a rep for Carey, in a statement.

So, how did such a high profile production featuring one of the biggest singers on the planet unravel? A closer autopsy of the performance, which began with Carey singing “Auld Lang Syne,” clearly indicates that her backing track didn’t match her vocals. By the time she launched into “Emotion,” it was clear that Carey couldn’t hear the playback, causing a lip sync fail that rivals Ashlee Simpson’s infamous Saturday Night Live botch.

At one point, Carey told the audience that she “didn't have a sound check, for the performance and, that “it is what it is.” Billboard confirmed that a “difficult rehearsal schedule” was to blame for the snafu. “She didn't have the kind of time that she usually gets for her ‘Mariah-ness,’” a source said.

After a visibly frustrated Carey told the audience that she was “trying to be a good sport,” the diva finally realized that it just wasn’t her night, and left the stage with one final, perfect proclamation: “It just don't get any better.”

What a pro.
