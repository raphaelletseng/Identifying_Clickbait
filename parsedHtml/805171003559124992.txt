The one thing you should never do to your hair first thing in the morning
The one thing you should never do to your hair first thing in the morning


For most people, the three basic parts of a good morning routine involve a quick shower, brushing one's teeth and then, most crucially of all: getting the hair-do on point for the day ahead.

But there's one cardinal sin that many of us are apparently committing in this final part of the trio without even realising it.

George Northwood is a man who knows a thing or two about hair. According to his website, the hair stylist boasts of high profile clients like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Alexa Chung.

Speaking to Vogue recently, Northwood ran through several before and after bed routines to get the perfect hairstyle for the day ahead.

But the one thing he said you should never do in the morning is brush:

Never, ever brush in the morning. For one thing it leads to frizz, and secondly there's always an element of mechanical damage. Use your fingers and you'll be able to feel out any tangles.

And now you know.
