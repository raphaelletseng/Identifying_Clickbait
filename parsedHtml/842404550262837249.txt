Rick Ross Takes Shots at Birdman on "Idols Become Rivals"

Birdman, Ross says, was in people's pockets "by the time we could count to five." Ross also mentions Birdman's widely covered struggles with Lil Wayne and says he hopes "Mannie Fresh will get to see the light." The track samples Jay's closer "Where Have You Been." In an interview with last month, Ross teased the track without dropping names.

Following Birdman and Wayne's appearance onstage together in January 2016, Ross seemingly referenced the reunion in a Snapchat video. In a December 2015 interview on , Ross confirmed he had no relationship with Birdman. "For me to see the way things have transpired, I can't respect that, and I don't respect that," Ross said .
