Rasila's Killer Was Stationed On Another Floor, Far From The Murder Spot
Rasila's Killer Was Stationed On Another Floor, Far From The Murder Spot The police probe on the Infosys murder has opened a Pandora's Box of security lapses, much to the company's detriment. Accused Bhaben Saikia was deputed at a different location of the same Infosys building on the day of the murder, and wasn't supposed to get anywhere near the secure conference room where victim Rasila Raju OP was working. Yet he did and, surprisingly, no one stopped him, even though Saikia was captured on closed-circuit television (CCTV) while entering the restricted building. Saikia is currently being grilled in Hinjewadi police's custody. Assistant commissioner of police (Chatuhshrungi division) Vaishali Jadhav Mane told Pune Mirror, "According to the records of the security agency, Saikia's duty was at a different location on Sunday. However, he left his designated spot, merrily entered the building where Rasila was working and killed her." According to the police, the company's CCTV cameras recorded his entry on the floor where Rasila was working. But not a single security guard stopped him."The security guards deployed for the monitoring of the CCTV should have immediately confronted Saikia while he was trying to enter the building. The CCTV footage also shows that he entered and exited the restricted area multiple times. But, not once did the guards object to that, which shows that there were serious security lapses on the part of guards there." Even Pune police commissioner Rashmi Shukla had expressed that if the CCTV would have been monitored by the security guards, the incident could have been avoided. Rasila Raju OP, the 24-year-old IT professional from Infosys, was strangulated to death inside her office on Sunday evening. This was the first case of murder inside the campus of an IT company in the city. Police managed to arrest accused security guard Saikia from Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) early on Monday -within eight hours of the incident -even as he was trying to flee to his native place in Assam. Meanwhile, the police have recovered the access card of Rasila, which Saikia had used while entering and leaving the conference room. Hinjewadi police officials told Mirror, "While Rasila was in the conference room, Saikia requested her to hand over the access card to him, saying he would be getting in and out of the room multiple times and did not want to disturb her. When she handed over the card, he used it a number of times. And, after killing her, he swiped it for the last time before leaving the conference room."
