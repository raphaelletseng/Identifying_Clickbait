New Jersey's most expensive home is back on the market for $48.8 million â take a look inside


The Stone Mansion, a 30,000-square-foot property located on the former Frick Estate of New Jersey's exclusive Alpine community, is back on the market for $48.8 million.

Still New Jersey's most expensive home, itÂ features 12 bedrooms, 19 bathrooms, and extravagant features like an indoor basketball court and a 4,000-bottle wine cellar.

The home has been on and off the market for several years, but this time it's being listed by its current owner, Richard Kurtz, CEO of property management company Kamson.

"I built the house with my ex-wife, with the intention of living in the home," Kurtz recently told Business Insider. "We worked hard together on picking out every detail, spending days on end in the mansion and with the architects, designers, construction team ... I no longer need this large of a home, and I am hoping that it ends up in the right hands, with a buyer who will appreciate the details, love and sweat equity that I have put in it over the years."

Below, see photos from a recent listing of the stunning home, which was decorated by celebrity home stager Meridith Baer.
