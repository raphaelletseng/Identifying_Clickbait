17 Times Pizza Was Disrespected In The Worst Possible Ways
You think you're funny? We'll see how funny you feel when we show up next to your bed at 3 a.m. with pitchforks and torches demanding answers.                                                                                                       YOU: You know, that actually sounds like it might —" ME: "SHUT YOUR MOUTH! YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH RIGHT NOW!"                                   After we confront the "cut a slice out of the middle of the pizza" person, we're bringing our pitchforks and torches after this guy.                                   You want to be creative? Try knitting. LEAVE PIZZA ALONE!                                   And don't think we didn't see the egg on #14 and the kidney beans on #18. Have you no shame?                                   YOU: "But it's gorgeous! I mean look —" ME: "YOU THINK I DON'T SEE IT'S GORGEOUS? BUT IT'S NOT PIZZA! IF I WANT SOMETHING PRETTY I'LL BUY A PAINTING!"                                   Australia, you're nailing the pancakes and meat pies... mad respect. But we need to have a pizza intervention.                                                                     FALL ASLEEP? ON A PIZZA? YOU DON'T FALL ASLEEP ON A PIZZA! YOU CHUG A RED BULL AND WAIT! LEAVE NO PIZZA BEHIND!!!                                   It was only ever sold in the Middle East and parts of Europe. Rumor has it the people who tried a slice cried for 11 days afterward.                                   WTF, Japan? Do we need to visit you after we finish with the Australians?                                                                     Pretty sure this pizza was the reason the Blue Jays didn't win the World Series.                                   Ma'am, pizza lovers everywhere salute you.

YOU: You know, that actually sounds like it might —"

ME: "SHUT YOUR MOUTH! YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH RIGHT NOW!"
