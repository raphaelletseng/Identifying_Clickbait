Steph Curry regularly lights up the internet with preposterous basketball deeds, so at first glance this ultra-sweet behind-the-back pass seems like more of the same.Â

But ... ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤” ... something's off here. Way off.Â

It went unnoticed in some quarters, but that shouldn't have counted! The pass looks cool, sure, but Curry definitely double-dribbled.Â

Watch again just before Curry crosses the three-point line: He transfers the ball from his left hand to right hand, then dribbles again with his right hand before whipping the lefty behind-the-back pass.Â

So it's actually FAKE NEWS. (Well, a fake highlight, but tomato-tomahto, y'know?)

The Warriors even shared the double-dribble pass among other plays in this 30-second highlight reel.Â

And if you're wondering: The rest of Curry's highlights there aren't illegal; they're just unfair.Â
