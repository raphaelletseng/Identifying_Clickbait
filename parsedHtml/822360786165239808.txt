At Trump Hotel in Washington, Champagne Toasts in an Ethical ‘Minefield’
At Trump Hotel in Washington, Champagne Toasts in an Ethical ‘Minefield’
WASHINGTON — With sirens blaring, a fleet of limousines and security personnel raced down Pennsylvania Avenue twice in less than 24 hours to deliver Donald J. Trump to inauguration events . But he was not heading to the White House. He was going to Trump International Hotel. It was a telling destination for those visits Wednesday night and Thursday afternoon. Perhaps more than any other location in Mr. Trump’s real estate empire, this 263-room hotel epitomizes the convergence of Donald Trump the global businessman and Donald Trump the president-elect. Conflicts that for months have been theoretical are now about to become real — most immediately a possible challenge by the federal government. It owns the building that houses Mr. Trump’s hotel and has granted him a 60-year lease. From the moment he is sworn in as president at noon Friday, Mr. Trump may be in violation of that lease, given a provision that appears to prohibit federal elected officials from renting the Old Post Office building, the Pennsylvania Avenue landmark that houses the hotel, from the government. Guests at the hotel include foreign diplomats and politicians who could be looking to curry favor with Mr. Trump — but even the act of paying their bills as they check out after the inauguration may open Mr. Trump to a challenge that he has violated the United States Constitution, which prohibits federal government officials from taking payments or gifts from foreign governments. Members of Mr. Trump’s new cabinet are also staying there this week, as are dozens of big-ticket donors to his presidential election campaign and inauguration . The hotel will also be the site of a prayer breakfast on Friday before Mr. Trump is sworn in. All these bookings mean payments to the Trump Organization for the hotel rooms, meals and other accommodations.

Clarke Jr., the Milwaukee County sheriff, a Fox News regular and a Trump supporter, was camped in the bar sipping Stoli Cranberi vodka. Among the other guests were Hary Tanoesoedibjo, a billionaire businessman and politician from Indonesia who is Mr. Trump’s business partner in two hotel projects there, and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York . The minimum nightly rate at the hotel will be $735. One suite during inauguration week was offered for $500,000, with various perks. On Thursday, the president-elect attended a lunch with Republican leaders of Congress, cabinet members and hundreds of others in the hotel’s enormous Presidential Ballroom, which features nine glass chandeliers and gold and white walls. “This is a gorgeous room,” Mr. Trump told the gathering. “A total genius must have built this place.” Nearby, in the lobby bar, guests drank Champagne and ordered expensive cocktails off a drink menu that includes a $100 libation called the Benjamin, made of vodka, raw oysters and caviar. Guests wore red and white “Make America Great Again” hats. Graphic As Trump Takes Office, Many Conflicts of Interest Still Face His Presidency By continuing to own the Trump Organization, conflict of interest accusations will persist. “That building is symbolic of the minefield that President-elect Trump has decided to walk through,” said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, who is the ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is charged with investigating any potential wrongdoing by government officials. “We are going now from the hypothetical to reality — and I myself am not sure where it is going to lead.” Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, defended Mr. Trump’s continued close ties to the hotel. “That he’s going to his own hotel? I mean, I think that’s pretty smart,” Mr. Spicer said. “I think the idea that he’s going to his own hotel shouldn’t be a shocker. It’s a beautiful place. It’s a place that he’s very proud of.” Mr. Spicer added: “It’s an absolutely stunning hotel. I encourage you all to go there if you haven’t been by.” The story of Mr. Trump and the Old Post Office began in August 2013, when the General Services Administration awarded Mr. Trump the contract that would allow him to develop the landmark tower. His children Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. each have a small stake in the company that holds the lease. Mr. Trump, who owns the vast majority of the company, is the only family member with a financial interest in the project, however, investing roughly $2.4 million of his own money, records show. The Post Office project is valued at roughly $200 million, much of it financed by Deutsche Bank, a favorite lender of the Trump Organization. The bank agreed to lend up to $170 million. The deal requires a Trump company to pay the government $3 million a year in rent from the hotel’s opening date. Advertisement “This is a location like no other,” Mr. Trump said in an interview in 2013 . “You have the Capitol, you have the White House and right in the middle you have the Old Post Office.” Mr. Trump was keen to begin construction and in 2014 boasted that the hotel would open in time for the 2017 inaugural parade. At the time, however, few could have foreseen it would be Mr. Trump’s inauguration Washington would be celebrating, and the headache that would create. The lease between the General Services Administration and the Trump company includes a clause — “no member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom” — that federal contract experts say makes clear that Mr. Trump will be in violation of the deal as soon as he is sworn in.
