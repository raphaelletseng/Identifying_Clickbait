British Food, Explained For Americans
British Food, Explained For Americans
Though as good as curry in Britain is, our Mexican food is rubbish. Sorry.                                                                                                                                                                                                       In some parts of Britain you can add scraps on top of the chips. In other parts you can add bits. These are the same thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Unless we call them just pancakes, because at this point it's getting less confusing.                                                                                                                                                                      Except at the weekend. Pubs are great for food at the weekend.                                                                   Also, there are no tabs. Well, there are, but it's a bit weird to get one.

With the possible exception of the deep-fried Mars bar, which is exactly what it sounds like, delicious, and also Scotch. Well, Scottish, which is what Scottish things are usually called unless they're called Scotch, or are literally Scotch whisky, which is just called Scotch, unless it's from Ireland, which is partly in the UK, and where it's called whiskey, which is different from whisky.
