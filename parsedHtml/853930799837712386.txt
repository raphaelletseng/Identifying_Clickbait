Conservative ministers call on Theresa May to divert foreign aid money to defence budget
Cabinet ministers have reportedly called on Theresa May to reduce the government’s foreign aid spending and boost the defence budget in the next Tory manifesto. They believe the UK is doing more than its fair share when it comes to overseas development spending. Senior Conservatives want to scrap the UK's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its gross national income (GNI) on helping poorer countries and divert the money to keep Britain safe. This would see a combined defence and security budget increase from two to three per cent of national income.

The move would be justified by the idea that helping countries such as Yemen, Somalia and South Sudan to fight against terrorism would in practice act as foreign aid, Whitehall sources have said. The plan would also include a proposal to call on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to change the definition of aid spending to include security and peacekeeping operations, according to The Times . Last year, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that all areas of spending would be re-examined before the next Conservative manifesto is produced. But cutting foreign aid might not be as easy a process since the 0.7 per cent target was set by the UN and later enshrined in UK law by David Cameron. This commitment also benefits from wide cross-party support and the proposal could struggle to be adopted by Parliament. In 2016, the UK spent £13 billion on foreign aid - making it the world's third biggest donor after the US and Germany.
