President Donald Trump looks back at his first 100 days during ’s live coast-to-coast show. Played by Alec Baldwin again, Trump is speaking with Vice President Mike Pence (Beck Bennett) about the highlights (or lowlights, depending on who you’d ask) of his presidency so far. Then Pence informs him that his top advisers have been at each other’s throats, and he must do something about it. Steve Bannon as the grim reaper returns, as well as a very stylish and very quiet Jared Kushner. The two stand before him like contestants on a reality TV show. Trump must choose between the two, dragging out the elimination longer than necessary. We won’t spoil it for you, but let’s just say someone gets sent back to hell. Watch it above.
