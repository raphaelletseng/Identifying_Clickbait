Almost immediately, everyone on Twitter began making the same joke about what kind of signal Spicer was trying to send. Look closely. The White House spokesman is wearing a US flag upside down, traditionally a sign of great distress. https://t.co/9pV021Qrj0 @CNN  @ChrisCuomo Does Spicer have an American Flag pin on his lapel and is it upside down?
