Highlights and Analysis of the 2017 Oscars
Highlights and Analysis of the 2017 Oscars
Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Will they be celebrating “La La Land” in the city of stars tonight, or is it time for “Moonlight” to shine? We’ll find out soon as the 89th Academy Awards get underway, and we’ll be here to comment and complain throughout the evening. I’m Dave Itzkoff, a culture reporter for The New York Times. I’m joined by Wesley Morris, critic-at-large, and Melena Ryzik, a fellow reporter and awards-season veteran.   Wesley Morris Critic  Thanks for joining us, everybody. Who knows what’s going to happen tonight that we don’t already know is going to happen? Will the “La La Land” Express run through the best actor category and take Ryan Gosling with it? Odds feel low, but high for Casey Affleck or maybe — maybe! — Denzel Washington.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Hello! Dave, can we comment, complain and commend? To veteran awards-watchers, the winners this season seem more pre-ordained than usual, but you can always count on at least one big upset. I’d look for it in the best actor/supporting actor categories. Though “La La Land” has the lion’s share of nominations, it could still be a banner night for African-American contenders — not that it would take much to break those records.   Wesley Morris Critic  Well, just to say a little more about the racial politics here. The Academy might be off the hook this year. But, look, as far as I can see, there’s barely anything coming up later this year that’s keeping Hollywood from a redux of last year’s show. So, hey Universal, y'all better get that campaign rolling for Jordan Peele. #GetOut2018BestPicture   Melena Ryzik Reporter  With recent changes to its membership, the Academy is longing to put #OscarsSoWhite behind them. But this year, of course, the question is not if the show will be political, but how political it will be - even if viewing audiences are tuning in for a palate-cleanser. The Oscars can be a cultural distraction, no doubt. Though when the choices boil down to fabulism (“La La Land”), realism (“Moonlight”) or long-overdue historicism (“Hidden Figures”), it still feels like we’re part of the political conversation — whether the President tweets about it or not.     Wesley Morris Critic  And what about Jimmy Kimmel, who’s hosted everything except my birthday party? What’ll he bring to a night whose political climate practically makes it impossible for winners to win with denouncing that climate? It’s going to be exciting. It’s also gonna be weird. But we’ll get through it together!   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  No irony here - I thought Nick Kroll and John Mulaney had a killer opening monologue at the Independent Spirit Awards last night. Jimmy Kimmel has his work cut out for him.   Patrick Healy Deputy Editor    Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Does it feel to the two of you that the winners of this year’s awards are pretty much in the bag?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Are there any major categories that could surprise us?   Melena Ryzik Reporter  I think best actor is tighter than people appreciate, and a category like best documentary is a real toss-up. If I was still making predictions, those are the ones I’d be losing sleep over. And what if Isabelle Huppert pulls off an upset as best actress for “Elle”? Could happen.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  (But it’s Emma Stone’s to lose.)   Wesley Morris Critic  I had my annual Oscar dream last night and Isabelle Huppert tried to take Emma Stone’s Oscar – like, out of her hands, from the stage. So there’s that.   Wesley Morris Critic  Huppert could play a mean Kanye, by the way.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Wesley, that’s her problem – and her superpower.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Is anybody looking for anything from Kimmel besides just, you know,  moving the thing along?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I think it’s all about the opening monologue - if he lands it, the rest of the night should be gravy.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  I feel like the mileage will be in the speeches, and not the hosting.   Wesley Morris Critic  I think Jimmy Kimmel knows this and will not let any winner keep him from losing tonight.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Let’s forget about odds-on favorites - who do you want to hear an acceptance speech from tonight?   Melena Ryzik Reporter  She’s going to win anyway, but Viola always nails it – poignant, thoughtful and powerful.   Wesley Morris Critic  Mel Gibson. That’s guy’s probably got some stuff get off his chest, huh?   Wesley Morris Critic  Can I also just say about Emma Stone, that even though the idea of her winning over Huppert and Streep for this performance is comical (maybe even to her) it doesn’t make me want her to win any less. And her thinking it’s comical – or my thinking she’d thing that – is partly why.   Wesley Morris Critic  Most suspenseful categories: Documentary and Actor. I think enough people will have seen enough of “OJ.”   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Here we go.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I didn’t realize Justin Timberlake could do another Jimmy’s show.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Fallon is kicking himself now for not placing that call for the Globes.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I am not feeling this “Feeling.” Sorry.   Wesley Morris Critic  Raoul Peck, who directed “I Am Not Your Negro,” is really into Justin Timberlake, who James Baldwin would have had some eye emoji for.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Wesley, was this part of your Oscar dream too?   Wesley Morris Critic  What? Where Justin Timberlake explains Bill Withers to Denzel Washington? Melena, I live that dream everyday. It’s rough.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I don’t get that at all.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Very lukewarm to me.   Wesley Morris Critic  Hate to say it, but #oscarsstillsowhite   Wesley Morris Critic  It’s from Trolls and it’s trolling.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Jimmy Kimmel says it’s his first time at the Oscars and, “The way you guys go through hosts, this is probably my last time.”   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Kimmel starts with a Mel Gibson ding, but Gibson takes it in stride, giving the thumbs-up to a Scientology joke.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Knowing his audience is appealing to him to provide unity, Kimmel says, “There’s only one ‘Braveheart’ in this room and he’s not going to unite us either.”   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Kimmel now promising to bury the hatchet with Matt Damon, his long-running would-be nemesis from late-night TV. “When I first met Matt, I was the fat one,” he jokes.   Wesley Morris Critic  This might be actually be smart: taking all of the political suspense out of the room, by dumping on Damon.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  “I want to say thank you to President Trump. Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?” - Kimmel finally utters the T-word.   Wesley Morris Critic  I’m digging this. He’s funny and so far: “The only movie with a happy ending is in the middle of ‘Moonlight.’”   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  The lack of response to a great (dirty) “Moonlight” joke is an unfortunate indicator of how few people in the audience actually saw “Moonlight.”   Wesley Morris Critic  True, they didn’t watch it.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  A lot of the Oscar voters aren’t in the audience, though.   Wesley Morris Critic  Also true.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Don’t dunk on me tonight, Melena.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “Meryl Streep has phoned it in for more than 50 films over the course of her lackluster career,” Kimmel jokes, channeling a certain president of the United States.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  “Nice dress, by the way,” Jimmy tells Meryl. “Is that an Ivanka?”   Wesley Morris Critic  Jimmy’s really trolling the president without overdoing it. Wicked smaht.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Good monologue. Would’ve been even better without the Timberlake lead-in.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Timberlake is a ballsy warm-up act, though. Crowd dug it.   Wesley Morris Critic  That was 1989’s “Snow White” opening on so many levels.   Wesley Morris Critic  Timberlake, I mean.   Wesley Morris Critic  First up, best supporting actor. Rigged category alert: Why is Jeff Bridges a supporting actor? He’s the star of that movie.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I would say the same about Dev Patel!   Wesley Morris Critic  Same! “LION” IS ABOUT HIM!   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Because the studios (and sometimes the stars) decide which category is the least competitive! Mahershala Ali (“Moonlight”) is the expected winner.   Winner  Mahershala Ali wins best supporting actor for “Moonlight.”   Wesley Morris Critic  You guys, Remy has an Oscar!   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  He got robbed at the Golden Globes, but otherwise this was a shoo-in.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  And deservedly so.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  His Juan in “Moonlight” is an indelible performance.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  He just had a daughter four days ago!   Wesley Morris Critic  It was such a smart way to play what, in the movies, is a tired part. That’s the gamble of the whole movie. A lot of smart choices.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Winning an Oscar has to be a bit of a comedown after the birth of a child.   Wesley Morris Critic  That’s why I have a “no babies” policy at my house.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Perhaps because of the family news, he made a personal, rather than a political speech - in contrast to the SAG awards ceremony, where he made a powerful speech about being a Muslim.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Back from break. Kimmel is just going with crowd work.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  It’s a shade away from winging it.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “We have no tolerance for fake news.” says Kimmel. “Fake tans, yes, but fake news?”   Wesley Morris Critic  Slay alert: Kate McKinnon is on stage.     Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Did they bring her and Jason Bateman out to “On Golden Pond”?   Melena Ryzik Reporter  If she can stride like that to “On Golden Pond,” bring it.   Winner  “Suicide Squad” wins best makeup and hairstyling.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “Suicide Squad” is an Academy Award winner. I don’t know what to think.   Wesley Morris Critic  You should think that was the best thing in the movie. And, Dave, hush: This man “waited 50 years to talk.”   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Congratulations to executive producer Steve Mnuchin. I’m glad things are going his way.   Wesley Morris Critic  Oh, Dave, you bad.   Winner  “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” wins best costume design.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “Obviously I didn’t prepare anything,” says Colleen Atwood, who clearly did not expect to win.   Wesley Morris Critic  So here’s the hard thing about a movie that’s set, nominally, in 2016 but is nominated for 14 Oscars: You’re probably going to lose them to louder movies with plot set in the past and movies that hired Colleen Atwood, who now has more Oscars than Meryl Streep.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Even nominally contemporary movies almost never win costume design awards. But other “below-the-line” categories, like art direction, could point to a near-sweep by “La La Land.”   Wesley Morris Critic  Melena, if “La La Land” wins the sound Oscar, it’s probably over for everybody else.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  If it wins the editing award, it’s definitely over. That’s the bellwether prize that Oscar-watchers pay attention to.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “Doctor Strange was nominated for outstanding visual effects, and was also nominated for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,” Kimmel says in a dual tribute to superhero movies and Dr. Ben Carson.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  The stars of “Hidden Figures” are now on stage. Guys, I know “Moonlight” is a towering achievement for indie cinema, but I’m pulling for a “Hidden Figures” upset.  It’s pretty much a classic Oscar film.   Wesley Morris Critic  Melena, I’m secretly with you!   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  The real Katherine Johnson, one of the subjects of “Hidden Figures,” is here, brought out onto the stage.   Wesley Morris Critic  This is really nice. She looks just like Miss Julia Porter, my granny’s buddy!   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Facts for the win, please.   Wesley Morris Critic  It’s best documentary time. SUSPENSE. KILLING. ME.   Winner  “O.J.: Made in America” wins best documentary feature.   Wesley Morris Critic  YEEEESSSSSSSSS   Wesley Morris Critic  I can finally eat.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Yes or no: should “O.J.” have been eligible?   Wesley Morris Critic  Yes, Dave.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Definitely! We’re in a beyond-platform world.   Wesley Morris Critic  It was shown in theaters and is still in some theaters. And IT’S A MOVIE.   Wesley Morris Critic  But it’s a fair question.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Ezra Edelman dedicates the win to Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown, as well as the victims of police brutality.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “Almost midway through the broadcast the crowd turned on Kimmel,” the host self-narrates after trying to make an O.J. Simpson joke.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  How soon until Dwayne Johnson hosts the Oscars?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  An hour?   Wesley Morris Critic  He isn’t hosting now?   Melena Ryzik Reporter  #OscarDreams   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  This Lin-Manuel fellow can rap.   Wesley Morris Critic  Why can’t these musical numbers ever, ever exorcise Debbie Allen?   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Truly, how often do they need to be convinced that the Cirque du Soleil stuff doesn’t work live?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  You will both go to the Broadway adaptation and you will like it.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  *Hangs head* You’re so right, Dave.   Wesley Morris Critic  The upside is that every time a bunch of dancers wave fabric, at least one black woman is always winning at the Oscars. Love you, Debbie!   Wesley Morris Critic  I know we’re supposed to listen to Academy President Boone Isaacs, but when can we talk about Halle Berry’s hair?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Did Kimmel introduce her as “a president who believes in arts and sciences”?   Wesley Morris Critic  I believe he did!   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs has stepped up to change the demographics of the organization – even if it seemed to happen under duress. It’s  a notoriously secretive group. so even though there are lots of Oscar “factoids” floating around about the winners, there’s no public database of information about the members.   Wesley Morris Critic  Melena, that’s right. And it’s never really going to like anything’s changing if the movies aren’t changing.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  They’re parachuting bags of candy onto the crowd now. Why.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  I’m over the snacks-at-awards-show thing.   Winner  “Arrival” wins best sound editing.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I’m glad “Arrival” will go home with something.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Whatever it ends up with, it deserved more.   Wesley Morris Critic  I will say that that I did hear stuff in “Arrival” that was new to me. It was inventive.   Winner  “Hacksaw Ridge” wins best sound mixing.   Wesley Morris Critic  Whoa.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  The “La La Land” snub is on.   Wesley Morris Critic  But it’s a war movie.   Wesley Morris Critic  They win this.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Dave, bring it! But it’s actually unusual for musicals to be nominated in the sound categories, somehow.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I’m sure that snub will be very short-lived.   Wesley Morris Critic  Sound mixing: War movies win before space movies. Space movies win before musicals. This is a non-scientific analysis.   Wesley Morris Critic  Melena and Dave, can we also talk about the fact that, for me, these awards are taking place under increasingly compromised circumstances?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  How so?   Wesley Morris Critic  Well, there are just fewer American movies that speak to some higher artistic purpose. I’m saying this as a critic and a regular moviegoer.   Wesley Morris Critic  I honestly don’t what this show is going to look like in a year. Forget race and gender, I’m talking about quality.   Wesley Morris Critic  OK. Done being a crank.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Wesley, I don’t know. Can’t we depend on the new platforms to bring new perspectives? Or at least hope for Nick Kroll and John Mulaney to host?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  This is going to Viola, yes?   Wesley Morris Critic  Yup, this Viola’s.   Wesley Morris Critic  But Naomie Harris’s clip is FIRE.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Watching Naomie Harris’s clip I kind of wish it could go to her.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  jinx!   Winner  Viola Davis wins best supporting actress for “Fences.”   Wesley Morris Critic  Can I just say that I love Octavia Spencer and think all Oscars should go to her? We have no idea yet how great she can be.     Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Getting my transcription fingers ready.   Wesley Morris Critic  I think Viola Davis has worked with so many of these people. They love her.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  This is a richly-deserved  prize but it’s also an example of one where it’s for a body of work as much as for a single performance.   Wesley Morris Critic  You’re right, Melena. She should have three of these things .   Wesley Morris Critic  She also gives a [expletive] speech.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  That’s no small part of it, Wesley.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “There’s one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered - one place - and that’s the graveyard. People ask me all the time, what kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola? And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed, big, and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist and thank god I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.” – Viola Davis   Wesley Morris Critic  Hold on. I’m gonna finish crying.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  They are not going to play her off, thankfully.   Wesley Morris Critic  Yes. That speech was so beautiful and damning. It kind of alludes a little to what I was complaining about earlier. The stories are out there, but who’s going to have the temerity to tell them? It was the most apt kind of political speech.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  It seems so far that the winners and presenters are taking the high road, when it comes to making overtly political statements. Only Kimmel has gone there, and everyone else has just tipped their hat to the power of openness, immigration, and diverse perspectives.   Wesley Morris Critic  It’s entirely possible people were lightly/strongly encouraged not to go there. But what winners have said so far have felt true and right and sincere.   Wesley Morris Critic  The movies’ problems predate the current president and, if the past is any kind of guide, will persist long after he’s gone.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “I don’t know if anybody’s going to be able to give a speech after that,” Kimmel says about Viola, and for once he’s not kidding.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  For anyone keeping track, by the way, after losing in the sound categories, it’s now impossible for “La La Land” to win the most Oscars ever. It’s now mathematically impossible for #LaLaLand to win the most #Oscars ever — Jarett Wieselman on Twitter ( jarettsays )   Wesley Morris Critic  Charlize Theron on Shirley MacLaine in “The Apartment” is pretty wonderful.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I am seriously getting choked up at Charlize Theron and Shirley MacLaine together.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “That’s the nicest reception I’ve had in 250,000 years,” MacLaine quips.   Wesley Morris Critic  Isn’t Shirley looking good?   Wesley Morris Critic  Isn’t she still funny?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  She is irrepressible and still the best.   Winner  “The Salesman” wins best foreign language film.   Wesley Morris Critic  Asghar Farhadi sends a speech and protests the immigration ban and insists that filmmaking can bring us together. That’s how you send a proxy.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Statement: “It is a great honor to be receiving this valuable award for the second time. … I’m sorry I’m not with you tonight. My absence is out of respect for the people of my country, and those of [the] other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.  Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression.”   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between us and others, an empathy which we need today more than ever.”   Melena Ryzik Reporter  The nominees in this category also jointly put out a statement decrying the rise of fanaticism.   Wesley Morris Critic  Farhadi’s movies are great political statements that, to me, are perfect, dramatic puzzles. Someday he’ll get out of the foreign-language-film ghetto.   Wesley Morris Critic  Without having to switch to English.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  The response in that room to his win made it sound like he’s close, Wesley.   Wesley Morris Critic  Hope so.   Wesley Morris Critic  A pal pointed out that the most direct political statement of the night (so far)  hasn’t come from, say, American actors. It’s come from the people most directly impacted by these policies: foreigners and award show hosts.   Winner  “Piper” wins best animated short.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I have to plead ignorance on this whole category.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  These categories are the least well-known but a win here arguably makes the biggest impact on a career.   Wesley Morris Critic  His voice and Hailee Steinfeld’s dress are some kind of sensory salad   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Gael Garcia Bernal calls himself a “migrant worker” in making a statement against the proposed border wall.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Bernal: “As a human being, I am against any form of wall that wants to separate us.”   Wesley Morris Critic  That was well done, what GGB did. Eloquent, pointed, personal.   Wesley Morris Critic  Well, when you think about it…   Winner  “Zootopia” wins best animated feature.   Wesley Morris Critic  I’m looking at Jamie Dornan, and I’m asking myself why the default setting for actors now is “Tom Hardy goes to prom.”   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Here comes production design. This is a big category for the “La La Land” crowd.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  It’s 0 for 3 so far but the night is (gulp) young.   Winner  “La La Land” wins best production design.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  WHEW, La La Land will not go home empty handed. What a relief.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  A husband-and-wife team!   Wesley Morris Critic  From our pal Tamara about these two: #relationshipgoals #winanoscarwithbae   Melena Ryzik Reporter  I think this is the beginning of many speeches that pay tribute to Damien Chazelle’s directorial prowess.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  They’re bringing in tour bus riders who don’t know they’re entering the Oscars ceremony. It’s making me nervous.   Wesley Morris Critic  This group of L.A. tourists don’t know what they’re about to walk into.   Wesley Morris Critic  This is cool. Look at Keith Urban taking pictures of tourists!   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Those tour bus riders are going to have the most viral tweets and it is not fair.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  So many GIFs in this moment.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Denzel Washington just unofficially married a tourist couple.   Wesley Morris Critic  Ok so I’m crying again. This is so lovely and weird and weirdly lovely.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  How much vetting did these folks have to go through?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  They’re just going to give out the remaining awards in a 10-minute spree, right?   Wesley Morris Critic  The bride is still rocking Jennifer Aniston’s sunglasses.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  M.V.P. to the guy trying to shepherd everyone through.   Wesley Morris Critic  That tourist drop-by was the sort of bizarre magical event that gets at what the Oscars telecast can be but rarely is: a live appreciation of what the movies and the actors in them mean to the people responsible for making and keeping them famous.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  And yet, Wesley, Twitter seems to be split on whether it was worthwhile.  The cynics among us  think those people might’ve been plants.   Wesley Morris Critic  It’s not theater and not a concert but a happening that involves giving normal people something to do. I’m open to arguments against it but can’t think of any because IT WAS GREAT.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Even if they were plants?   Wesley Morris Critic  Wait what???   Wesley Morris Critic  They’re plants??   Wesley Morris Critic  Melena, don’t dunk on me!   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Who knows in this topsy-turvy world? Only the very Rev. Denzel can say for sure.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I will quickly say I enjoyed the conceit, just not the duration.   Wesley Morris Critic  This “movies around the world” interlude is the opposite of that first, classic Chris Rock sketch in which he asks black people if they’ve heard of any of the best picture nominees.   Winner  “The Jungle Book” wins best visual effects.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  When Disney realizes they can make animated movies out of the live-action movies it makes from its animated movies, they’re going to make a fortune.   Wesley Morris Critic  And leave it to the Disney guys to have the opening words of their acceptance speech be, “Well, this never gets old.”     Maira Garcia digital editor  Jimmy Kimmel invited tour bus riders to the #Oscars https://t.co/qne8CBRbAw — New York Times Arts on Twitter ( nytimesarts )   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Dave, don’t forget the amusement park ride prequels! Meanwhile, the chatblog production team is divided on the tour bus bit. Readers/viewers, what do you think? Tweet us at @nytimesarts @nytimesarts I’m certain those tourists were caught completely unaware. Kimmel made a spectacle of them. —  Sugar Beats  on Twitter ( sugarbeats ) @nytimesarts great bit! I’m sure it was jimmy’s idea!  great! — Yelena on Twitter ( yelenasencion )   Maira Garcia digital editor    Maira Garcia digital editor  @nytimesarts - Tour bus bit was cute, went on too long. Hope they weren’t plants. — The Gibson Girl on Twitter ( gibsonlass )   Wesley Morris Critic  Seth Rogen, lover of “Back to the Future” and shrugger at “Moonlight” and “Arrival”: —  ( uptomyknees )   Winner  “Hacksaw Ridge” wins best film editing.   Wesley Morris Critic  Uh oh.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Whoa!   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  wha   Wesley Morris Critic  Well, listen, I have no argument against the editing of “Hacksaw Ridge,” but there really were four other strong options. It feel like a line might be being drawn. So who know what else is going to happen to “La La Land” now.   Wesley Morris Critic  The line is that it’s OK to give Mel Gibson stuff again, including a pass.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  So Oscar watchers know that if a film doesn’t get a best editing nom, it has essentially no chance for best picture. And “Hacksaw Ridge” was definitely a surprise, but looking back over the last few years, it’s common for editing and best picture to split. Don’t count out “La La Land” yet.   Wesley Morris Critic  It hadn’t occurred to me that “Hacksaw Ridge” had a credible shot at that editing prize. The Oscars are a complex place.   Winner  “The White Helmets” wins best documentary short.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  The film’s cinematographer was recently denied entry to the United States. The filmmakers said  he “was not able to travel to the Oscars due to his passport being cancelled by the Syrian regime despite having been issued a U.S. visa specifically to attend the awards ceremony.” U.S. Blocks Syrian Rescue Worker From Attending the Oscars Khaled Khatib, who helped film a nominated short about his group, was denied a passport waiver. Homeland Security cited “derogatory information.” The New York Times   Winner  “Sing” wins best live action short.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “We’re more than two hours into the show and Donald Trump hasn’t tweeted at us once, and I’m starting to get worried about him,” Kimmel says.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  He really did tweet this:   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Hey @realDonaldTrump u up? — Jimmy Kimmel on Twitter ( jimmykimmel )   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  And this:   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  @realDonaldTrump #Merylsayshi — Jimmy Kimmel on Twitter ( jimmykimmel )   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Does it seem like there are a lot of international presenters, in a pointed way?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  To me it seems no more than usual? But they are certainly making the most of their presence.   Wesley Morris Critic  I felt that way last year, too, when the producers had to ask like Priyanka Chopra to present. But this points in a different way.   Wesley Morris Critic  None of the last six best director winners have been Americans.   Wesley Morris Critic  Kathryn Bigelow was the last American, the first woman and the last one of those, too.   Wesley Morris Critic  Leslie Mann and John Cho really have the material of the night.   Winner  “La La Land” wins best cinematography.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  And here come more of those Chazelle shout-outs.   Wesley Morris Critic  ((((((I don’t think it was the best cinematography)))))   Melena Ryzik Reporter  (Yes but was it the best thing about the movie?)   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “We’re so sorry about what happened in Sweden last week,” Kimmel jokes to Linus Sandgren.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Kimmel brings in his “Celebrity Mean Tweets” bit with some nominees and some past winners.   Wesley Morris Critic  Some of them are truly harsh. Some of them are right.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  It took 17 hours to get to the mean tweets segment and it was worth it.   Wesley Morris Critic  I’m not saying which are which.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  They’re not going to make Gosling sing this?   Wesley Morris Critic  There’s a cruel, telling irony in having John Legend carry Ryan Gosling’s musical bags for him.   Wesley Morris Critic  The movie’s “villain” is now required to fall on his sword by channeling the talent the film’s star only had to pretend to have.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  It’s disrespectful to Gosling’s storied history with the Mickey Mouse Club.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  So one of the knocks against “La La” is that Gosling and Stone, for all their charms, are no Fred and Ginger. But I have to say: I enjoyed watching them try to sing and shuffle on screen. The effort was part of the characterization in some way – even if not intended as such.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Even the beautiful people have to try sometimes.   Wesley Morris Critic  Oh sure, I buy the formal conceit of the movie and believe in the competing movie-musical schools it’s trying to synthesize. But I object to the way an idea of artistic purity is drawn across an obvious but unspoken racial boundary that that musical number just waltzed over.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I am fine with any movie that makes me think Ryan Gosling would be my friend if we met.   Wesley Morris Critic  I’m also with Dave on that.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  I would’ve preferred friendly Channing Tatum.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  How is there time for more crowd work   Melena Ryzik Reporter  All in all, way more Kimmel than I expected.   Wesley Morris Critic  Oh look, the Oscar band’s down in the sunken place from “Get Out.”   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  It is 11:15 p.m. and we are only up to original score.   Winner  “La La Land” wins best original score.   Wesley Morris Critic  There’s also the fact that I can’t tell the difference between the “La La Land” music and music you’d hear… at the Oscars.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  I think you’ve hit upon the reason it will be an Oscar winner, Wesley.   Winner  “City of Stars” from “La La Land” wins best original song.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  They held an awards show and didn’t give an award to Lin-Manuel Miranda. But this was preordained.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Absolutely, even though they had another song in the running – they campaigned harder for this one, awards-watchers said, so as not to split the vote.   Wesley Morris Critic  I’ll just say, “La La Land” is a rare frustration for me. I like this movie and yet it’s hard for to argue against the arguments against it. I really like Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. I believe in that speech Benj Pasek just gave. It’s just that there are old – ancient – American politics about who gets to be the standard-bearer and face of an art form that this movie walks into that are hard to ignore and easy to roll your eyes at.   Wesley Morris Critic  It’s as if it doesn’t know what it means to bring up this stuff in this particular way, with jazz of all art forms.   Wesley Morris Critic  But, look, Damien Chazelle is an insanely talented guy (“Whiplash” has not dissimilar problems yet survives them) and I imagine we’ll all be here in 2019 or whenever toasting him after he gets Neil Armstrong to the moon.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Hang on, still crying a bit.   Wesley Morris Critic  Jimmy Kimmel roasting Matt Damon in “We Bought a Zoo” is funny.   Wesley Morris Critic  Damon comes out to present best original screenplay and Jimmy Kimmel has the band try to play him off.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  This show is way too long but I needed the constant goofing on Matt Damon to cheer me after the In Memoriam segment.   Wesley Morris Critic  This hazing of Matt Damon never gets old.   Winner  “Manchester by the Sea” wins best original screenplay.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Was this an upset?   Wesley Morris Critic  For me, “Hell or High Water” was the best of that lot.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  So this doesn’t bode ill for “La La Land’s” chances at the biggest prize of all?   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Kenneth Lonergan gets the prize from his buddies Matt and Ben. It wasn’t an upset, Dave: the script was considered its best shot for a prize, besides star Casey Affleck.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  The White Helmets is the top trending search on Google in America following film’s Academy Award win, per @GoogleTrends. — Evan McMurry on Twitter ( evanmcmurry )   Wesley Morris Critic  I think it does – but there have been lots of years in which a heavily nominated movie winds only a handful of statues.   Winner  “Moonlight” wins best adapted screenplay.     Wesley Morris Critic  This is really excellent.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  I think “La La Land” is still very much in the running. The win for “Moonlight” was also expected in this category, and it does help its case in the best picture race.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Kimmel: “Just because a screenplay is adapted doesn’t mean we love it any less.”   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Four more awards. No more snack bits, PUHLEASE.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Ok, we’re in the homestretch. Pause while everyone appreciates Halle Berry’s hair.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  They played her on to the theme from “The Bodyguard” because…?   Wesley Morris Critic  “Lion” is a best picture nominee and Halle Berry’s hair.   Winner  Damien Chazelle wins best director for “La La Land.”   Melena Ryzik Reporter  As expected, Chazelle wins, and he’s almost surely on his way to best picture. Though “La La Land” missed some of the early technical prizes, it picked up steam through the night. And the other favorites, “Moonlight” and “Manchester by the Sea,” earned the also-ran screenplay prizes, where the Academy goes to celebrate risk.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Dave, Wesley: Casey or Denzel? I’m a Viggo girl myself.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  (As in, I’d like him to win. Not that he will.)   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Denzel.   Wesley Morris Critic  I think Affleck was really good. Denzel though.   Wesley Morris Critic  And despite everything, I love Ryan Gosling in this.   Wesley Morris Critic  I do not like “Captain Fantastic” but what Viggo does in it is mostly wonderful.   Winner  Casey Affleck wins best actor for “Manchester by the Sea.”   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Did I say Denzel? I meant Casey Affleck.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I’m not going to read anything into Denzel’s reaction shot. Right?   Wesley Morris Critic  I always feel bad for people who have sit there and be gracious when you lose something you want.   Wesley Morris Critic  It seems AWFUL.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Save us, Leonardo DiCaprio.   Wesley Morris Critic  Is Isabelle Huppert a “rape victim” in Elle?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Kind of…reductive.   Winner  Emma Stone wins best actress for “La La Land.”   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I’m with Chrissy Teigen, who had her head on John Legend’s shoulder   Wesley Morris Critic  Well, I have to say, I’m happy for Emma Stone. There are about five movie people I like to see work, unconditionally. She’s one of them. I hope winning doesn’t turn into the creative curse that it has for a lot of people.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  No chance!   Wesley Morris Critic  Hilary and Helen and Kate W. and Gwyneth and Halle…   Wesley Morris Critic  I hope it stays electric for Sly and the Emma Stone.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Meanwhile, we are creeping up on longest-Oscars-ever status, which our eagle-eyed editor tells us was 4 hours and 23 minutes in 2002.   Wesley Morris Critic  Whaa?   Wesley Morris Critic  Are we close to that?   Melena Ryzik Reporter  If we get more Matt Damon bits, yes.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  “We’ve reached the halfway point of the show,” Kimmel quips.   Wesley Morris Critic  It’s best picture time, presented by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  So sweet to see Shirley MacLaine waving to her lil’ bro.   Wesley Morris Critic  Shirley MacLaine was waving like she hadn’t seen him since “Bulworth.”   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Any chance of a last-minute upset? “Hidden Figures”?   Wesley Morris Critic  I had a pang of “Hidden Figures” earlier.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  I wish! But here’s the solace: “Hidden Figures” is the champ at the box office, taking in more than “La La Land.” And “Moonlight” is doing well internationally, giving the lie to the Hollywood conceit that films with black stars don’t play well abroad.   Wesley Morris Critic  I honestly don’t know. There’s no real momentum,  anymore.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  WILL WE EVER FIND OUT?   Winner  “Moonlight” wins best picture.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Of course.   Wesley Morris Critic  Here’s to the dreamers.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  And the baristas.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Underemployed musicians?   Wesley Morris Critic  I’ve said my piece about this movie. How do you guys feel?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  It was totally charming and I’m at peace with it.   Wesley Morris Critic  What is going on?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  WHAT   Melena Ryzik Reporter  WHAT WHAT WHAT   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Live TV, people.   Wesley Morris Critic  This is crazy. What just happened?   Melena Ryzik Reporter  OK, now it’s a memorable Oscars.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Warren Beatty said he saw Emma Stone’s name on a card.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Beatty: “I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope and it said, "Emma Stone, La La Land.” That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny.“   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Is PriceWaterHouse Coopers fired? Who is the preparing these cards?   Wesley Morris Critic  This really is nuts. People are going to riot. People, please don’t riot.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Kimmel: “Well, I don’t know what happened. I blame myself for this. Let’s remember it’s just an award show, we hate to see people disappointed but we got to see some extra speeches. We have some great movies. Um, I knew I would screw this show up, I really did. … I promise I’ll never come back.”   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Ok, well when we all settle down from that photo finish, let’s review: It was similar to the Oscars of the last few years, a little something for everyone.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  WHAT — Dave Itzkoff on Twitter ( ditzkoff )   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  I mean, what else can you say?   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Let the conspiracy theories begin.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  It used to be a rarity for best director and best picture to split, but it’s now happened in four of the last six years.   Wesley Morris Critic  We’ve just entered some strange, new, arguably sad era in which these last-minute sure things turn into upsets in which someone has to apologize from the winner’s circle and the loser has to puzzle over the results.   Wesley Morris Critic  This will now no longer be a story of merits but of politics and optics instead of merit and worth. Or maybe it will.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Werner Heisenberg did a great job with tonight’s show.   Wesley Morris Critic  So much of these ideas about race and worthiness hanging over these big public national gatherings – the election, the Super Bowl, the Grammys, and now this – keep recurring. It’s fair to say we all have results-oriented PTSD. Or at least I do.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  No more cliff-hangers, please, America.   Wesley Morris Critic  No more trap doors!   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Is it good night? Is the show over? Who won? Who lost? Who’s to say anymore.   Dave Itzkoff Reporter  Maybe it’s morning. I’m scared.   Melena Ryzik Reporter  Dave, at least we’re all in it together. Thank you, everybody for joining us.  Oscars 2017 Advertisement

With recent changes to its membership, the Academy is longing to put #OscarsSoWhite behind them. But this year, of course, the question is not if the show will be political, but how political it will be - even if viewing audiences are tuning in for a palate-cleanser. The Oscars can be a cultural distraction, no doubt. Though when the choices boil down to fabulism (“La La Land”), realism (“Moonlight”) or long-overdue historicism (“Hidden Figures”), it still feels like we’re part of the political conversation — whether the President tweets about it or not.
