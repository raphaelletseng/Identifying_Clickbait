Astronauts from the International Space Station have touched down on Earth safely, after almost six months.

NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough, and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko, landed on the Kazakhstan steppes in the Soyuz capsule at 11:20 BST.

The crew spent 173 days in space and their landing was described by NASA as a "textbook touchdown".
