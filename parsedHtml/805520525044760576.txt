Hideki Matsuyama was far ahead of the field in first place atop an impressive leaderboard:

He had a run of eight holes in a row without a par, earning a combination of birdies, bogeys and double bogeys to create an interesting scorecard.

Post-Round Reaction

Woods discussed his inconsistent play after the round, per USA Today:

I was playing aggressive; this golf course allows one to be aggressive. But also I made some bad mistakes. For instance, today I had two sevens. ... Three doubles today, it adds up to a pretty high number. On the flip side is that I was able to be aggressive, made some birdies, made some putts. I just need to balance it out.

He will have some time to figure everything out before his next big event, but he will have to really limit the bogeys and double bogeys if he wants to stay competitive.
