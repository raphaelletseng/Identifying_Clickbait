Cirque du Soleil founder Gilles Ste-Croix's son killed in 'tragic' on-set accident

Posted

A Cirque du Soleil technician who was killed while setting up for a show in the United States was the son of co-founder Gilles Ste-Croix, the circus said.

Olivier Rochette, from Quebec, was struck by a telescopic lift in a "tragic accident" before the show Luzia in San Francisco, Cirque du Soleil said in a statement.

He was taken to hospital, but died soon after.

The circus said it was "in mourning" over the accident.

"I am heartbroken," chief executive Daniel Lamarre said in a statement.

"I wish to extend in my name and in the name of all Cirque du Soleil employees my sincerest sympathies and offer my full support to Gilles and his family.

"Olivier has always been a member of our tight family and a truly beloved colleague."

Police said investigators were working to determine the cause of the incident.

Mr Rochette's death comes after Australian Cirque Du Soleil acrobat and former Olympic gymnast Lisa Skinner fell 3 to 5 metres, landing on her head during a show in Brisbane on Sunday.

She lost consciousness and was treated for neck pain at the scene before being taken to hospital in a stable condition.

Mr Ste-Croix co-founded the internationally-touring circus with Guy Laliberte in 1984.
