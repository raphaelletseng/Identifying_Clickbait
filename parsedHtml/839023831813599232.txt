Adele provided some slapstick comedy with her concert in Brisbane, Australia, on Sunday night when an uninvited mosquito joined her onstage.Â

The superstar singer freaked out in reaction to the little blood-sucker, swiping at the air and then actually running away from it in fear.Â

"It was sucking my blood, it was sucking my blood!" she proclaimed to the audience, as a fan video shows.Â

Later, she announced almost sadly she had hurt the insect before screaming that its friend had come to help him out and panicking amidst a supposed swarm of mosquitos that could not be seen from the audience.Â

Naturally, the whole thing elicited a good laugh from the crowd.Â
