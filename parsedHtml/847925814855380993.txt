Kendrick Lamar's lyrics about photoshop and stretch marks are sparking a lot of feelings
Kendrick Lamar snuck up on the world yet again, dropping a music video for new single "Humble" Thursday.Â If the 4 million views on YouTube in less than 24 hours is any indication, the majority of people seemed to lap up new work from the Compton rapper.Â But, like most things, there is room to appreciate and critique an artist at the same timeâ€”which is exactly what people on Twitter have been doing. SEE ALSO: Sit down and watch Kendrick Lamar's new video for 'Humble' "Iâ€™m so fuckinâ€™ sick and tired of the Photoshop / Show me somethinâ€™ natural like afro on Richard Pryor / Show me somethinâ€™ natural like ass with some stretch marks / Still will take you down right on your mamaâ€™s couch in Polo socks," Lamar raps on "Humble," all while a women appears on a split screenâ€”half of her in flawless makeup with straight hair, and the other half with no makeup and curly hair.Â Â Â To some, it was a welcoming acknowledgement of no-makeup fierceness and stretch marks, a 100% normal thing that happens to humans that unfortunately has a negative social stigma attached to it.Â So... I'm thinking about @kendricklamar 's new video for #Humble & the casting call where they said. "Naw, sis.
