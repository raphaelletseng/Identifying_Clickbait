Mark Hamill Returned as The Joker to Read More Trump Tweets
Much like Heath Ledger’s Joker in Mark Hamill is a man of his word . After breaking the internet with The Trumpster , a character he created by reading Donald Trump’s antagonistic tweets in the voice of The Joker—which he perfected over years of playing the Gotham villain on Hamill promised that he would resurrect the character whenever the occasion called for it. Because Trump’s skin is paper thin, it wasn’t long before he took to Twitter to attack a foe. Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a..... Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never "mocked" a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him....... "groveling" when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media! This time around, Hamill used Trump’s tirade against Meryl Streep —which he unleashed after the actress unloaded on him at the Golden Globes—to illustrate the similarities between Batman’s arch nemesis and the future President of the United States. "Am I the only one man enough to confront this #OverratedFunkyLoser without resorting to an ad hominem assault?" Hamill tweeted Saturday, along with a link to his latest reading.

The bad news? No more Trumpster. So let’s appreciate him while we can. Listen to the clip below.
