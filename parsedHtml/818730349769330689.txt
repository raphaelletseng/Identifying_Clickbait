Sometimes you look in the mirror in the morning, you see dark lines around your eyes starring back at you.

Normally that’s just a sign that you shouldn’t have had that third drink/ binged those six episodes on Netflix last night.

However, they might be something more worrying.

Dark circles around your eyes could indicate nasal congestion.

As pointed out by Her, the skin around your eyes is incredibly thin, and thus very susceptible to showing inflammation.

While strolling into the office with big bags around your eyes will make everyone think that you’ve just had a big one on a school night, it can also be a sign of blocked sinuses, often linked to allergies like hay-fever.

So what can you do about it?

Standard treatments for nasal congestion are:

Clearing your sinuses with a saltwater solution

Vic’s VapoRub dissolved in hot water

An over-the-counter decongestant, (following the instructions on the packet)

Of course, if that doesn’t help it, you should contact your GP.

And then hopefully there'll be no more reasons to wear sunglasses indoors.
