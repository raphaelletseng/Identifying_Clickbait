Three Youths Fall While Trying To Take Selfie In A Moving Train, Crushed On The Track A chain of events set off by an accident while taking a selfie on a running train led to three youths being run over at Liluah in West Bengal on Thursday evening. According to passengers of the Up Bandel Local, Tarak Manna, 22, was clicking a 'groupfie' with a selfie stick when he suddenly hit a lamppost along the tracks, slipped and fell off the running train between the Belur and Liluah stations. Four of his friends got down from the train at Belur station and started running towards the accident spot along the tracks. But the youngsters failed to gauge that the Up Goghat Local was speeding down the same track. Before they could sway out of harm's way, three of them were crushed under the wheels of the train. The fourth youth was lucky to be flung off the track by the speeding train. Sumit Kumir, Chandan Polley and Kajal Saha — all in their early 20s — died on the spot while Kajal Biswas, was severely injured. Manna, who had survived the fall, was later rescued and admitted to Howrah District Hospital. His condition was stated to be very critical. "The details are sketchy, but according to witnesses, the youth fell off the train while clicking a selfie and his friends were run over while running along the tracks to rescue him," said Niladri Chakrabarty, SRP (Howrah). Curiously, another youth had slipped off the Bandel local in a similar fashion barely two hours before the incident. He, too, survived the fall and has been admitted to the Howrah General Hospital.
