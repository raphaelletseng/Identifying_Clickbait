Oscars Shocker: Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway Read Wrong Best Picture Winner

Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, stars of 1967's classic Bonnie and Clyde, announced the wrong best picture winner at the Oscars on Sunday to the shock of the crowd.Â

But Beatty and Dunaway announced the wrong best picture winner, announcing La La Land instead of Moonlight the correct winner.Â

"I wasn't trying to be funny," Beatty assured everyone, after admitting to the mistake and explaining that they had the wrong envelope.Â

The cast and crew of La La Land had already taken to the stage to give their acceptance speeches when the presenters told them of the mixup.Â

He told the audience that they had read the wrong envelope, seeing Emma Stone won for La La Land, who was actually the winner for best actress. Dunaway had read the winner before Beatty could stop her.Â

The duo was there to present the best picture award in celebration of the 50th anniversary of their classic film, Bonnie and Clyde.Â

Â

This was Dunaway's first time presenting the best picture award on Oscars night, but Beatty has done it twice before - once in 1975 and again in 1990. Beatty recently made a return to the screen, with his first film appearance in front of the camera in the 2016 drama Rules Don't Apply, which he also co-wrote, produced and directed.

The 89th Annual Academy Awards, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, were held Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center and aired on ABC.
