Sudden Weather Change Brings Snowstorm To UAE And Other Gulf States
Sudden Weather Change Brings Snowstorm To UAE And Other Gulf States The arid and dry desert land of the UAE and other parts of the Middle East experienced uncommon weather yesterday in the form of a snowstorm. Safe to say it was out of the ordinary. The blizzard covered parts of the country with up to 10 centimetres of snow, according to the local Met Office. The other Gulf States also experienced rare lightning strikes, sandstorms, rough seas and high winds of up to 90 km an hour. Also, a crane collapsed because of heavy winds and injured one person in Dubai. Intense winds also caused a fire in which three vehicles were destroyed. Among other weather-related incidents, trees were uprooted and traffic was severely disrupted. Poor visibility led to a number of accidents and left residents trapped indoors to avoid the dust storm taking place outside. According to the UAE Met Office, temperatures plunged to minus two degrees across several mountainous regions. Police warned people against going outside, although the rarity of the occasion saw many flocks to the snow-covered landscapes. Social media users shared their experience of the strange weather phenomenon. While some called the weather "apocalyptic", other said "the final hour was approaching".
