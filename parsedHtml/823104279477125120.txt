'Catastrophe' is declared in Chile as forest fires burn out of control


An official 'state of catastrophe' has been declared in central Chile as crews fought vast forest fires described as the worst in decades.

More than 175 square miles are ablaze in a region just south of the capital, Santiago.

As fire crews were brought in to the O'Higgins region, 200 people were evacuated.

Thirty homes were threatened in Cardenal Caro and Colchagua provinces, according to the country's National Emergency Office (ONEMI).

Josefina Lopez, from the ONEMI, said no lives had been lost but there had been considerable economic losses.

Agriculture Minister Carlos Furche told national radio the disaster was 'a sort of earthquake' for the region.

President Michelle Bachelet took time out of hosting a visit by her French counterpart, Francois Hollande, to declare the state of catastrophe, which allows soldiers to be used to help battle the fire.

Around 200 people have been evacuated from the largely rural O'Higgins region

A farming emergency was also decreed.

President Bachelet said France was offering help and she was also reaching out to other countries, such as neighbouring Argentina.

Chile's National Forestry Corporation said outside assistance was needed.

Interior Minister Mario Fernandez said helicopters and planes in particular were required to drop fire retardant liquid onto forests in the path of the blaze.

It is not known what caused the fire to break out but January is the height of Chile's summer and the forests are tinder-dry after several weeks without rain.
