Looking forward to you cleaning that lil issue up. @BetsyDeVos You worked a whole day but didn't have anything to write with? Maybe you could hold a bake sale to buy some pencils. . @BetsyDeVos "I know where they are" pic.twitter.com/CPqeweI1ol @BetsyDeVos The grizzlies got them. The grizzlies got everything.
