Bengaluru Gets Its 1st Vertical Garden To Curb Pollution & It Already Has Over 3,500 Plants After China's vertical forests went viral on social media, people are now praising Bengaluru's very first vertical garden that aims at curbing pollution and making the city beautiful. An initiative of SayTrees, the organic garden has come to Hosur Road Electronics City Flyover where over 3,500 saplings of 10 different species have already been planted. With an automated drip irrigation system installed within the garden, the plants will get their daily dose of 100 milliliters of water. Each side of the vertical garden comes with a unique design. According to SayTrees, all pillars of the flyover will soon be covered with these gardens. And the benefits of this biodiversity are manifold. As described by SayTrees, the gardens will help reduce urban heat island effect and smog; purify outside polluted air; act as a sound-proofing barrier; create a healthy habitat for birds and insects; increase real estate value; and much more. The project was cleared by the Bangalore Elevated Tollway Pvt Ltd. and took four months of meticulous planning. You can read SayTrees's entire Facebook post here.

Let's hope this initiative soon flows to other Indian cities, especially Delhi NCR where pollution hovers beyond normal levels.
