Downing Street has abandoned plans for Donald Trump to address Parliament during his state visit to the UK later this year, according to reports.

John Bercow 'strongly opposed' to Donald Trump address to Parliament

His visit is expected to stretch from a Thursday to a Sunday in August or September, when MPs are either on their summer holiday or attending party conferences outside of London.

The plan is “the preferred option” for the British Government, the source said.

Thousands of people took to the streets last weekend to demonstrate against Mr Trump, and his impending visit is likely to trigger a fresh wave of public anger.

Officials are said to be keen to limit the number of public outings by Mr Trump during the trip. That is likely to mean he will spend only a brief period in the capital, where protests are expected to take place.

Included in the trip will be an audience with the Queen, whom he has reportedly requested to play golf with.

Discussions are said to be underway for Mr Trump to play a round of golf on the private nine-hole course in Scotland as the Queen watches.
