The face masks helping kids beat London's air pollution 
London-based designer has developed pollution-busting face masks to protect children from the English capital city's toxic air. Doodle Masks come in colourful designs, including Disney film themes, designed to attract children, and are sold for £7.50 each online. Last year Britain's High Court ruled that UK government measures to combat air pollution were failing to comply with European Union rules on nitrogen dioxide limits. Later this year a new charge on the oldest and most polluting vehicles comes into force in an attempt to improve air quality. The 10-pound ($12.43) daily tax will apply to diesel and petrol vehicles typically registered before 2006 which do not meet the so-called "Euro 4" 2005 European directive to regulate vehicle emissions.
