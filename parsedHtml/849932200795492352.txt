European Parliament is a paper tiger and Britain must not fear these Brexit blowhards
uy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, grandly styles himself as the “lead Brexit negotiator” for the European Parliament, but in truth that title is a misnomer. Mr Verhofstadt is not a Brexit negotiator at all, despite his best efforts to lobby otherwise. Indeed, the European Council has explicitly said that Mr Verhofstadt will not be in the room when the talks begin. The Parliament’s representatives can attend the ‘sherpa’ meetings before each round of talks, but when it gets down to serious business, they will not be present. And to witness the performance as the European Parliament adopted its Brexit guidelines in Strasbourg this week, it is not hard to see why. t’s all perfectly entertaining watching Mr Verhofstadt duking it out with our own Nigel Farage , but in reality you’d not want either man in a negotiation which will determine the collective future of some 500m people....
