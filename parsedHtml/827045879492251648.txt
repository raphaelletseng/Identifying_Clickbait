Noah pointed out that Gorsuch could be the sole Protestant on the court since all of the other members were either Catholic or Jewish. The South African-born biracial comedian then admitted that this was one of the things about America that still confused him. “Can we get real for a second? America has so many flavors of Caucasian, it’s insane,” he said. “Sometimes, it feels like I need a white person sommelier to pick up the subtle differences.” Noah demonstrated what he meant by saying in a hoity-toity voice, “I’m picking up notes of Episcopalian with just a hint of Colorado,” before exclaiming, “I’m just smelling white guy!” ALSO ON HUFFPOST Donald Trump's Potential Supreme Court Justices       Share this slide:       MORE:
