Vandals spill 400,000 bottles of Italian sparkling wine in act of 'sabotage'
Vandals have spilled the equivalent of 400,000 bottles of Italian sparkling wine in an act of "sabotage". The raiders broke into the grounds of the Conte Vistarino winery in the middle of the night and drained seven refrigerated tanks of mostly Pinot Grigio, local media reports. The wine, from the 2016 harvest, was maturing in the tanks at the 1,000 hectare estate in the Lombardy hills in northern Italy before it would have been sold to third-party wine makers. The loss is estimated to have cost the estate around €500,000 (£420,000).
