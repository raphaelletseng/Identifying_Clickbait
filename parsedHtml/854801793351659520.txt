President Trump is eyeing cutting the Social Security payroll tax. If not replaced by another funding source, the move could kill the most popular inflation-adjusted retirement program.

While putting money in workers' pockets in the short term, nixing the payroll tax will undercut funding for the popular program and achieve the sinister goal of GOP leaders like Paul Ryan to privatize Social Security.

"This is an absolutely terrible idea, partially because it smells like a back-door way of cutting Social Security benefits," notes Michael Hiltzik of The Los Angeles Times. "It needs to be nipped in the bud."

Under a misconceived plan floating in Washington, Social Security could be funded by an import tax on goods from places like Mexico. An import tax, though, is seen as toxic, since it would raise consumer prices for imported goods and is opposed by global corporate interests.

"Those additional revenues [from the import tax] could then enable the end of the 12.4 percent payroll tax, split evenly between employers and employees, that funds Social Security, while keeping the health insurance payroll tax in place," the Associated Press reported.

"This approach would give a worker earning $60,000 a year an additional $3,720 in take-home pay, a possible win that lawmakers could highlight back in their districts even though it would involve changing the funding mechanism for Social Security, according to the lobbyist, who asked for anonymity to discuss the proposal without disrupting early negotiations."
