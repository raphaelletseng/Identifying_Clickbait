Within one week, Donald Trump has seemingly made more controversial decisions than any other President of the United States, calling for reduced funding to the UN, the scrapping of Arts funding, and that the infamous wall will be resurrected and paid for by Mexico.

Just hours after the latter announcement, Deadline revealed Fox has acquired Skyward, a film script by Joe Ballarini ‘about two families trying to escape to freedom over a wall’.

According to the synopses, the story will focus on two families in 1979 who secretly construct a homemade hot air balloon to cross over the Berlin Wall.

The report details how the film will be in a similar vein to Oscar winner Argo and The King’s Speech. Could Fox be looking at a potential Oscar film?

Karen Rosenfelt - who producer the Twilight series, The Book Thief, and Me Before You - will act as producer along with her Sunswept Entertainment.
