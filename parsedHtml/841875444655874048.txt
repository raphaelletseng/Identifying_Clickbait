Federal Inquiry of Fox News Moves to a Grand Jury, but Without Preet Bharara
Federal Inquiry of Fox News Moves to a Grand Jury, but Without Preet Bharara
The political drama around the federal courthouse in Manhattan did not end with the sudden, unexplained turnabout of President Trump in firing Preet Bharara , the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. While that prominent post always gets attention, one candidate frequently mentioned as a possible successor to Mr. Bharara could sharpen the scrutiny to new levels: Marc L. Mukasey , a former prosecutor who now works in white-collar criminal defense. As it happens, Mr. Mukasey has represented Roger E. Ailes , the former chairman of Fox News, who has long had a mogul-to-mogul relationship with Mr. Trump. Whomever Mr. Trump nominates to replace Mr. Bharara will inherit an investigation of Fox News. A federal grand jury sitting in Manhattan is expected to soon hear testimony from at least two witnesses about business practices at Fox News when it was led by Mr. Ailes, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Ailes, who was forced out in July amid revelations of multiple accusations of sexual harassment, has denied those charges. The current inquiry, which began in September and appears to be in an early stage, may be focused, at least in part, on settlement payments, a person with knowledge of the matter said. One of those subpoenaed, according to the two people, is Mark Kranz, the former chief financial officer for Fox News who oversaw the network’s finances when it paid millions of dollars in settlements. Mr. Kranz was appointed to his position by Mr. Ailes in 2004, and resigned last year, a week after Mr. Ailes had done so. Mr. Ailes helped prepare Mr. Trump ahead of debates in last year’s campaign . In 2014, Mr. Trump intervened in a dispute between Mr. Ailes and a former aide who said he had damaging information about Mr. Ailes and the network. Advertisement Mr. Trump negotiated a settlement on behalf of Mr. Ailes, and later boasted of his work , telling the journalist Gabriel Sherman, “When Roger was having problems, he didn’t call 97 people, he called me.” Advertisement The existence of the grand jury investigation of Fox News was disclosed in a state court proceeding last month by Judd Burstein, a Manhattan lawyer representing a former daytime host for Fox, Andrea Tantaros , who said her career suffered after spurning advances from Mr. Ailes.
