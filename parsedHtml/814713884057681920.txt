On Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump tweeted a link to his Instagram account with an enticing caption:

My Administration will follow two simple rules: https://t.co/ZWk0j4H8Qy — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2016

Upon further investigation, it can be revealed that the "two simple rules" he claims his administration will adhere to are "Buy American" and "Hire American":

My Administration will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN and HIRE AMERICAN! #USA A photo posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Dec 29, 2016 at 6:52am PST

Reactions to the social media cross-posting were mixed:

an instagram link in a tweet should be grounds for impeachment imo https://t.co/DBNPGJuHXH — Rafi Schwartz (@TheJewishDream) December 29, 2016

Some were angry at "clickbait" from the PEOTUS:

Did you seriously just try to click bait us to your Instagram? Oh my god XD https://t.co/YRcZL8Fcg0 — Nathaniel Bandy (@NathanielBandy1) December 29, 2016

Others were shocked that he used any medium other than Twitter:

Some focused on the fact that Trump appears to employ the same childlike graphic designer as the FBI:

Off topic, but Trump's graphic designer is apparently my grandmother in 1995 using Paint https://t.co/rtL4wIOFXV — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) December 29, 2016

Others mocked:

You know your administration is going to be shit if it has less rules than a game of dodge ball. https://t.co/9erNHuLQ5n — Sloppy Johnny (@watchjoeyrun) December 29, 2016

And others pointed out that this was just another Trumpian lie:

Neither your business nor Ivanka's use these rules. https://t.co/yskQ4oMOpO — Neera Tanden (@neeratanden) December 29, 2016

But there was one overwhelming reaction at the Donald's suggestion of two rules:

Rule 1. Never get high on your own supply.



Rule 2. Never sell no crack where you rest at.https://t.co/uGgbmJaPDm — Matt Fernandez (@FattMernandez) December 29, 2016

They were, of course, making up their own rules for Trump:

1. Do as I say, not as I do.



2. Quick! Look over there! https://t.co/tcF85owylv — dreggs (@dreggs) December 29, 2016

Many pointed out his hypocrisy:

1. Do as I say

2. Not as I do https://t.co/NDDNMqHGiV — Southern Libtard (@SouthernLibtard) December 29, 2016

Some were creative...

1) Use MS Paint for all press releases.

2) Make sure to use at least two different fonts in all graphics. https://t.co/EnqecEgkis — J.P. Polewczak (@jp_polewczak) December 29, 2016

Others blunt:

announce a new graphic designer and then resign https://t.co/paZSHFIjQu — Mark Yesilevskiy (@MarkWhyy) December 29, 2016

Some mimicked the President-elect's language:

Some were hopeful:

1. Don't be a dick. 2. Don't be a dick https://t.co/zK0MejmrEJ — Daniel Auld (@dan_auld) December 29, 2016

Others more cynical:

And some probably quite realistic:
