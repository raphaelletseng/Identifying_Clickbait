"We are thrilled that Kevin will bring to Microsoft his unique expertise developing platforms and services that empower people and organizations," Nadella said in a statement. "Kevin's first area of focus is to bring together the world's leading professional network and professional cloud." Microsoft's move is part of a broader pattern of the company giving top LinkedIn leaders key roles in the post-merger transition. LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner has also joined Microsoft's leadership team and is assuming the added responsibility of leading the merger integration efforts, at the request of Nadella. Weiner meets weekly with the transition team, which includes both Microsoft and LinkedIn executives. To give Weiner space for his post-acquisition position, his role as head of product is being transferred to LinkedIn's Ryan Roslanky, who most recently served as the company's global head of consumer product. Roslansky, a well-liked manager within LinkedIn, will now serve as global head of all LinkedIn products, including business services such as Recruiter and Sales Navigator. Roslansky previously led LinkedIn's mobile app overhaul and will continue to oversee LinkedIn's website and Lynda.com. Weiner will still be regularly involved in product at LinkedIn moving forward, a spokesperson said.    Trending on {{channel_name}}
