Rakhi Sawant has landed herself in a legal soup lately for the comments that she made against Valmiki on a show, which aired on a private TV channel last year.

An arrest warrant was issued by a local Ludhiana court on March 9 after it received a complaint against her. The complainant allegedly said that she hurt the sentiments of the Valmiki community by making objectionable comments against the harbinger-poet who wrote Hindu mythological epic Ramayana.

Rakhi Sawant has apparently failed to appear before the court despite repetitive summons. She didn’t appear before the court on March 9 as well.

“A two-member team of the Ludhiana police has left for Mumbai with the arrest warrant,” said the police.
