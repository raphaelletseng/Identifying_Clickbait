For a brief few minutes, “La La Land” lovers relished the victory, while those rooting for “Moonlight” to win best picture turned the TV off or tweeted their anguish. Then, in an awkward series of events sure to be permanently etched into Hollywood lore, it turned out to be fake news.

Anguish and celebration turned to confusion.

Presenting the best-picture award at the end of a long Oscars evening, Warren Beatty opened the envelope and after some hesitation, his fellow presenter Faye Dunaway announced that “La La Land” was the winner. Moments later, even as “La La Land” speeches began, a producer of that film made it clear that, in fact, “Moonlight” was the winner.

The words “WHAT IS HAPPENING?” trended on Twitter.

It was stunning for such a mix-up to happen on one of the most high-profile stages possible. Rumors long held that Marisa Tomei was given her best supporting actress award in 1993 by mistake, but those rumors have been thoroughly debunked.

Steve Harvey famously flubbed the winner of the 2015 Miss Universe pageant, but that gained prominence through media coverage in the days afterward. This time, the world was watching as it unfolded.

Here is a transcript of the scene. Grab your popcorn.
