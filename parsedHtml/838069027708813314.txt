This Hotel Is Named 'Walled Off Hotel' And It Boasts Of The 'Worst View In The World'
This Hotel In Bethlehem Is Named 'Walled Off Hotel' And It Boasts Of The 'Worst View In The World' Seaside view, beach view, city view, the world's best view etc. are some of the most cliched usages in the hospitality industry. But a 10-room hotel in Bethlehem has a bold claim as if the name 'Walled Off Hotel' wasn't strange enough, it brags about having “the worst view of any hotel in the world”. Founded by elusive British street artist Banksy, the hotel is in a peculiar location - just four metres from the wall which cuts through West Bank, and all the rooms overlook the wall. The project has been described as a "hotel, protest and art in one." “Walls are hot right now, but I was into them long before Trump made it cool,” the elusive artist said in a statement. Even the decor in the rooms are unique, one of them depicts a Palestinian and an Israeli in the middle of a fight - a pillow fight. Other decorations include security cameras, slingshots, guns etc. The Guardian reported that the hotel is meant to bring tourists and jobs to Bethlehem and foster dialogue between young Israelis who would stay there and the Palestinian residents of the city. Banksy in a statement said the hotel "offers a warm welcome to people from all sides of the conflict and across the world".

The hotel will open to guests on March 11, with rooms starting at $30 a night, but only after making a $1,000 deposit.

Banksy explains the logic behind the $1,000 deposit:

"The artwork here has been donated to the community and their struggle, and any person found attempting to steal from them, or deface hotel property, will be arrested, transported to the police station in Ramallah and prosecuted to the full extent of the local law."
