College Costs Too Much? N.Y.U. Paves Way to Graduate Faster
College Costs Too Much? N.Y.U. Paves Way to Graduate Faster
Students at New York University , where a year of undergraduate education can run to about $66,000 in room, board, tuition and fees, often complain about the cost of four years at the school in Greenwich Village. Now, N.Y.U. has a suggestion for them: Finish faster. On Friday, the university announced a series of measures that make it easier to graduate in under four years, part of an initiative aimed at diminishing the university’s enormous affordability problem. In some ways, the school is just catching up with its students. Ellen Schall , a senior presidential fellow and the head of the university’s a ffordability steering c ommittee , which is tackling college cost on a number of fronts, said that about 20 percent of N.Y.U. students already graduated ahead of schedule. “We were surprised,” Professor Schall said. “That’s part of what convinced us we needed to make this more transparent and more available to more students.” Advertisement Students have long found ways to make it through school more quickly to save money. But there is increasing momentum to formalize the process in the face of ballooning outrage over college costs and student debt — while N.Y.U. is expensive, many other private universities cost $60,000 or more a year. Advertisement Gov. John Kasich , Republican of Ohio, pushed to make it easier for students in his state to graduate from public colleges early by allowing more credits from high school or technical programs. Gov. Scott Walker, Republican of Wisconsin, included in his budget proposal this month that schools in the University of Wisconsin system should create a three-year degree for 60 percent of its programs by the summer of 2020. Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., which is a state school, has also been experimenting with three-year degree options. Among elite private institutions, official programs remain rare, though Wesleyan University, the Connecticut liberal arts school, announced a formalized three-year track about five years ago. N.Y.U.’s “acceleration” effort relies on a few shifts. For example, while students pay for 18 credits per semester, many actually take only 16, officials said, so the university will increase the number of two-credit courses it offers. It will also allow many students to transfer in up to eight credits from other schools, like local community colleges where they can take inexpensive classes over the summer — in the past, this has been allowed on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the university has trained advisers to help students create schedules that will get them to their three-year goal. But some who study education wonder what students will miss if they rush through their undergraduate years, and they worry about who will feel pressure to make those sacrifices. Sara Goldrick-Rab , a professor of higher education policy at Temple University, said that shaving time off college as a way to make it more affordable could raise some troubling questions. In college, she said, there is academic learning, but there are also important experiences outside the classroom, like the social networks students build, study abroad programs and internships — assuming students do not have to hold down jobs that crowd out those things in the first place. While some students can get what they need academically in three years, Dr. Goldrick-Rab said, packing in all those credits can take away from the time they can spend on other things. “We agree that the price of college is a problem,” she said. But she questioned whether the solution was “to essentially have less college, or less time in college.” Advertisement “It’s interesting,” she said of accelerated schedules, “but it worries me.” Michael S.

Mr Roth estimated that about 20 Wesleyan students annually graduate in three years, up from roughly three a year before they made the option official. As of this May, Purdue expects 14 students to have graduated in three and a half years or less, since the program was announced in 2014. “So far, we haven’t had a lot of takers,” said Josh Boyd, director of undergraduate studies in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue. “When we speak to parents, they tend to be more excited about it than the students.” Indeed, many American students take six years to graduate from college.
