A father sacked for skipping work when his wife went into labour has been inundated with job offers

A new father who was sacked for missing work for the birth of his child has been inundated with support from well-wishers – and several new job offers.

Lamar Austin had to missed his shift as a security guard when his wife Lindsay went into labour.

But when the father-of-four, from New Hampshire, told bosses he couldn’t turn up because of the birth of his son, he received a text telling him he had been ‘terminated’.

After hearing of Mr Austin’s sacking over the birth of son Cainan – the first baby born at Concord Hospital in 2017 – supporters set up a GoFundMe campaign for the family, which has already raised $1,785 (£1,441).

And not just that – the former US serviceman – has reportedly received a flurry of new job offers and apprenticeship offers.

At the time, Mr Austin said the decision was a no-brainer, telling the Concord Monitor: “It was hard, but if I have to choose between work and family, I’m always going to pick my family.

“Sometimes you lose something and you get something even better.”

It seems his prediction was right in more ways than one.
