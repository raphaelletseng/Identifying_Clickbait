I love skiing. Will you people who hate it please stop clogging up the mountains
I love skiing. Will you people who hate it please stop clogging up the mountains
ome friends are going skiing this weekend. Just popping over to the Alps, taking advantage of this season’s early snowfall to carve up the slopes a bit, enjoy a couple of cheeky glasses of vin chaud, feel the burn in the thighs and get into the festive mood in the fold of snow-covered mountains. Sounds idyllic, no? Well, maybe the alpine cottages and vin chaud bit. But the skiing? Sliding down an icy mountain on a couple of planks, spending thousands for the pleasure? An excellent – and highly expensive – way to break ones’ leg, surely? That, at least, is the conclusion to which one of our friends has come. So she will eschew the slopes and planks, and spend the weekend meandering cobbled squares, doing a little light shopping and getting stuck into the après ski. he is not alone. It turns out that more than a fifth of those who go on skiing trips never actually make it on to the slopes....
