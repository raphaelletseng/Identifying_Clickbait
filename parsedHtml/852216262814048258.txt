We're Now the Friendly Skies, Emirates Tells a Red-Faced United
Middle Eastern carriers seized on the social media storm surrounding the forced removal of a passenger from aUnited Airlines flight to hit back at one of the arch-critics of their breakneck expansion. Dubai-basedEmirates mocked United’s best-known advertising slogan on its Twitter account, urging passengers to “fly the friendly skies with a real airline.”Royal Jordanian Airlines joined in with a pun on the man being dragged from the plane, whileTurkish Airlines pointed out that it last week added an extra passenger to one of its flights after a baby was born on board.

The Emirates tweet includes a video mocking United Chief Executive OfficerOscar Munoz’s suggestion this year that Gulf carriers “aren’t real airlines” by highlighting its Tripadvisor ranking as the world’s best carrier in 2017.
