'It just didn't work out': Rudy Giuliani denies Trump overlooked him when choosing Cabinet


Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York denied on Wednesday that President-elect Donald Trump forgot about him and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey when appointing key members of the incoming administration.

"He didn't forget about us," Giuliani told Fox News during an interview. "He offered me some Cabinet positions, which I'm very, very thankful for, but it just didn't work out in terms of my private life."

Giuliani reiterated that Trump offered him some Cabinet positions but said the only job in which he was interested was secretary of state.

"He offered me jobs that probably at different points in my life I would've taken in a minute," he said. "I've got a big law firm, I've got a big consulting firm, I am extremely busy, and at 72 years old there was only one challenge I felt that was left for me. The others wouldn't have been a challenge."

The former mayor was an early frontrunner for secretary of state, partially because of his longtime support for Trump and vocal defense of him during the 2016 presidential campaign.

But Giuliani's financial ties to several foreign governments, as well as his open campaigning for the job, helped push Trump toward his eventual selection, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson.

Christie was also reportedly offered jobs including head of the Department of Homeland Security and US ambassador to Italy, but he turned them down. The governor didn't receive the nod for attorney general, a post he actively sought.
