Thai monkey steals coconuts and VODKA from tourists
Thai monkey steals coconuts and VODKA from tourists


Thailand is well known for its beach raves and cheap alcohol - but two holidaymakers were shocked when a monkey caused chaos by crashing their boat party.

The macaque clambered aboard the fishing boat and stole a tourist's vodka.

In the clip posted to YouTube by Chad Orr, the monkey jumped aboard the ship and had a look around for things that might take its fancy.

After scoping out his surroundings, he tried to grab a bottle of what appeared to be Gatorade off the cameraman.

But the tourist exclaimed - because, he said, there's actually vodka inside the bottle.

He said: 'That's vodka, man! Oh my God. We've got a drunk Thai monkey.'

He then span the camera round and said: 'I had nothing to do with this.'

The macaque seemed a little dazed by his tipple, and went to sit on the side of the boat to gaze into the water for a moment.

But he snapped back into action when he remembered that there were coconuts onboard the vessel.

When he returned for his second attempt to steal from the hoard of coconuts lying on deck, the man commandeering the boat made his move.

He leapt towards the maverick macaque, which then launched itself into the water.
