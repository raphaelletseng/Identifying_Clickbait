Cheryl Wassus went to the Motor City Furry Convention with her therapy dog, Link, expecting to spend the day among like-minded animals and their owners. But she could have never imagined what she had signed herself up for.

If it's any consolation, it looks like the dog had a great time.

Wassus told NY Magazine that sheâ€™d never heard of furries before, and had no idea she was walking into Furry Con.

She said:

No. You know, you get a little older, a little menopausal, and being in that many layers and layers of fur. No need to be overheating. Iâ€™m good.
