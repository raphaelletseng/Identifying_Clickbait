Back troubles have been a part of his career, but especially the last two seasons with the Broncos. His 2016 season was especially difficult as he missed most of the offseason work with an infection in his back that required repeated IV antibiotics to treat. He also missed five games with a fractured forearm last season.

A nine-time Pro Bowl selection, he'll turn 35 in late July and is eighth all time in sacks with 138.5.

Ware needed one sack to tie newly minted Hall of Famer Jason Taylor, and with four sacks he would have passed Michael Strahan and move into sixth place all time.
