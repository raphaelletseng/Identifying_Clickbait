Now, Netflix Users Can Watch Movies Offline on Their Mobile Devices
Now, Netflix Users Can Watch Movies Offline on Their Mobile Devices
Netflix announced on Wednesday that users worldwide can download some videos to their mobile devices instead of streaming them over cellular data, a feature that could keep eyeballs on the app when internet signals are spotty or unavailable. Users boarding an airplane, leaving on a road trip or ducking into the subway, for example, could use Wi-Fi to download their favorite movies and TV shows beforehand, then view them when the cellular signal dips out. Netflix said that initially, only some of the content in its library will be available offline via the feature, available in the latest version of its app on phones and tablets using iOS or Android. The company did not specify how many programs would become available for download later, saying only that there would be “more on the way.” Even in areas with strong cellular coverage, watching content offline would allow users to avoid depleting their monthly data limits, addressing a major frustration of mobile video, which eats up data ravenously.
