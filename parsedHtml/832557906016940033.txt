Yosemite Firefall: National Park optical illusion makes waterfall look like fire

Posted

It's something you have to see in person, photographers say, but the images are pretty spectacular.

Every year for a few days in February, the setting sun draws a narrow sliver of light on a waterfall in the Yosemite National Park in the United States, making the water glow orange and red like a cascade of molten lava.

The phenomenon known as "firefall" draws scores of photographers to a spot near Horsetail Fall, which flows down the granite face of the park's famed rock formation, El Capitan.

Capturing the amazing sight is a challenge, though.

Horsetail Fall only flows in the winter or spring, when there is enough rain and snow, and the sun lights up the waterfall for only about two minutes at dusk for a few days in February.
