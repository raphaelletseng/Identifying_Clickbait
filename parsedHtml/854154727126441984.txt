Hilarious notes parents left for their children
Hilarious and very sarcastic notes parents leave for their children


Parenting can be a difficult and thankless task.

But these hilarious pictures prove it doesn't have to be boring.

Families around the world took to the internet to share some of the funniest notes children had been left by their parents.

Some used the snarky notes as a way to remind their children of their chores, with one clever parent printing out a poster about washing the dishes.

Others used them to transform a warning into a light-hearted joke. One mother wrote how she would 'cut' her children if they messed up the kitchen she had just spent more than an hour cleaning.

Many used the notes as a chance to show off their creativity, using crafts, colouring pencils and building blocks to bring their messages to life.
