The biggest 2016 fantasy football lessons you shouldn’t forget next draft season

It seems everyone is hoping to forget 2016. That’s fair. But there are plenty of lessons worth remembering. That applies to fantasy football too. After all, to borrow and slightly alter a phrase , those who forget their mistakes will be doomed to repeat them. So, let’s do some learnin’, shall we? We believed at the start of the year that wide receivers were the best early picks due to their reliability. And yet eight of the top 10 flex players were running backs in 2016, while the top five receivers — Jordy Nelson, Antonio Brown, Mike Evans, Odell Beckham Jr. and T.Y. Hilton — provided their owners with just single-digit scoring days five or more times each. Compare that to top running back David Johnson (zero) or even DeMarco Murray (two) or Melvin Gordon (also two) and you can probably see why you should think long and hard about picking a running back in Round 1 next draft. We believed that a few quarterbacks, particularly mobile quarterbacks, were worth drafting early because of their high point floors. And yet Russell Wilson and Cam Newton finished Week 16 ranking 13th and 16th among QBs in standard scoring leagues. We thought drafting a rookie in the first round wouldn’t be worth the risk. And yet Ezekiel Elliott sits No. 2 in fantasy scoring this season, over 40 points ahead of LeSean McCoy who resides in third. There’s plenty more where that came from. In a special season finale — that co-host Gene Wang totally ditched for his “real job” to cover a bowl game — the Beat brings in Pro Football Focus Editor in Chief Jeff Dooley and Washington Post analytics writer Neil Greenberg to revisit the biggest lessons from the 2016 season and discuss what they might mean come draft time in 2017. | With the conclusion of the fantasy season, the Beat will return in March for a free agency special, and again following the NFL draft in late April.
