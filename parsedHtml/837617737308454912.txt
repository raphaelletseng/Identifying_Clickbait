Eagle Armed With A GoPro Hunts A Fox, And It's Intense
It’s clear from this video that eagles do mess around. Watch as a golden eagle with a GoPro hunts a fox . “Hunt” might even be too generous a word. The eagle is like a fox-seeking drone missile, homing in on its prey. The clip comes from a short film called “Eagle Hunters In A New World,” which GoPro also posted online. The film is about the Burkitshi eagle hunters in Mongolia. The description states: “On the Western plains of Mongolia a nomadic group of Kazakhs continue the ancient practice of hunting with golden eagles. The Burkitshi are a small and dwindling community, eager to pass on their traditions in the face of growing modernization in Mongolia.” Watch the full film here .
