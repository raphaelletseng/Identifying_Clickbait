Reports: Adam 'Pacman' Jones arrested, accused of head-butting officer and spitting on jail staffer


Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones has been arrested on multiple charges, including assault and harassment with a bodily fluid, according to multiple local reports.

According to WLWT, Jones was arrested early Tuesday morning at a Hyatt Regency Hotel in Cincinnati and is accused of pushing a security guard and poking him in the eye.

According to Fox19, Jones is also accused of kicking and head-butting the arresting officers and of attempting to "take off" when they tried to place him in a police car.

Fox19 reports that Jones is also accused of "spitting on a nurse on the jail medical staff."

The charge of harassment with a bodily fluid is a felony. The other charges are misdemeanors.

Jones has been arrested multiple times during his NFL career. The most notable was Jones' suspected involvement in a Las Vegas strip-club shooting that left one doorman paralyzed. Jones pleaded no contest to a charge of conspiracy to commit disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to probation and was later held liable for $12.4 million in damages.

Jones' agent didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
