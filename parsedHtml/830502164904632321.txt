Speaking to National Public Radio in the US in 2014, Mr Johnson said renouncing his American citizenship was “very hard”.

“You may not believe this but if you’re an American citizen, America exercises this incredible doctrine of global taxation, so that even though tax rates in the UK are far higher and I’m Mayor of London, I pay all my tax in the UK and so I pay a much higher proportion of my income in tax than I would if I lived in America.

“The United States comes after me, would you believe it, for capital gains tax on the sale of your first residence which is not taxable in Britain. They’re trying to hit me with some bill, can you believe it?”

Mr Johnson later said he had settled the tax demand with the US authorities.

Other people, who have previously renounced their American citizenship include, actor Yul Brynner, soprano Maria Callas, businessmen Kenneth and Robert Dart, investor Mark Mobius, and Eduardo Saverin, a co-founder of Facebook, Bloomberg reports.
