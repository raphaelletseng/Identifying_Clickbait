Tim Daw, May winner

The snowpack in Oregon may be good this year, but it will take several years to emerge from drought in the western US. Here a tractor is harrowing rather than ploughing, to prevent the soil surface from drying out too much. MICK RYAN, JUDGE: Often photographers are advised to fill the frame, but sometimes it is best to give the subject space and let it do the talking. Everything’s happening in the lower fifth of the frame here: a tractor, its dust trail, fence line and grassland, all against snowy mountains, and above lovely emptiness giving those subjects emphasis.
