Yup. They actually did a serious scientific study to arrive at this conclusion. We wonder if it was a bar-room bet!

In a bizarre (but sophisticated) experiment designed to investigate the biomagnetic characteristics of “American cockroaches,” a team of physicists sentenced several cockroaches to instant death by flash freezing them with nitrogen. The luckier ones were kept alive but chilled down to 4°C to immobilize them.

Later on both sets of cockroaches were exposed to a magnetic field -- around 100 times stronger than a fridge magnet’s -- for about 20 minutes and a magnetometer was used to measure their magnetic decay -- the rate at which the cockroaches “lost” their induced magnetism.

The scientists -- really? -- discovered that the alive cockroaches lost their magnetism completely in barely 50 mins, but frozen dead cockroaches’ magnetism took about 48 hours (two full days!) to wear off completely, according to The Register.

Why the heck did the researchers conduct such a bizarre experiment?

“Our work fills the gap between behavioral experiments on insects in magnetic fields and characterization of magnetic materials in their bodies,” claimed the team of researchers, comprising of Ling-Jun Kong, Herbert Crepaz, Agnieszka Górecka, Aleksandra Urbanek, Rainer Dumke, and Tomasz Paterek, according to their research paper submitted to Arxiv.

These people aren’t wasting their time, argues MIT Technology Review, claiming that engineers would benefit from a better understanding of biomagnetic sensing in birds and bugs, so that they could design better sensors.
