New on Netflix May 2017: House of Cards, Master of None, F Is for Family returning in streaming service's best month yet
May 2017 could well be one of the greatest months Netflix has ever had with the return of several beloved originals as well as the release of a much-anticipated film starring Brad Pitt . Top of the deck is political drama which is returning for its fifth run with Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright still attached. Usually, that'd be your lot but brace yourself - it seems like May wills ee you cancelling many a plan: season two of both - Aziz Ansari's acclaimed comedy series - and the Wachowskis' mind-bender are both being unveiled, as well as the third season of Ellie Kemper comedy . Then there's the swansong of family drama which will wrap up the story of the fractured Rayburn family spearheaded by Sissy Spacek.
