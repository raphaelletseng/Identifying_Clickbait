Odell Beckham Jr. Snags 1-Handed Touchdown Catch vs. Lions
Odell Beckham Jr. made a lunging, one-handed touchdown reception look routine.

His latest highlight-reel catch helped expand their lead to 17-6. Unlike an earlier play in whichÂ he was awarded a catch even though the ball hit the ground, Beckham maintained possession on this grab and strutted into the end zone for his 10th touchdown of the season.
