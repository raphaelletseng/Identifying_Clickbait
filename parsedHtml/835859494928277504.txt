A Rising Black Leader Who Pulled Off His Own Fake Obituary
It is impossible to know what Grady O’Cummings III might have represented to the group of youngsters he was holding court with in this photo taken in September 1963.

I didn’t go to the police because I am not an informer and didn’t want to get involved.” The News’s account never explained why he had decided that the threat to his family had diminished enough in just four months for him to re-emerge, and in such public and dramatic fashion. Perhaps at least partly because he had misled the public, he never attained the political success he sought.

It is impossible to know what Grady O’Cummings III might have represented to the group of youngsters he was holding court with in this photo taken in September 1963.

Mr. O’Cummings, who was photographed with the youngsters outside his office in Harlem, announced the next month that he would seek the Democratic nomination to run for president in 1964. He was one of the first African-Americans to run for president.

Certainly Mr. O’Cummings must have represented hope and possibility to the boys who had gathered around him that day.

Dedicated to economic and political empowerment for blacks, Mr. O’Cummings founded the National Civil Rights Party in 1963 to foster black enterprise and to appeal to liberal whites. He said at the time that the organization had 450 members, with branches in Chicago, Cleveland and Philadelphia. The party designated him its presidential nominee days before he decided to run as a Democrat.

It will never be known where Mr. O’Cummings’s ambitious political aspirations might have taken him. His dreams appeared to be cut short when it was reported that he had had a massive heart attack and died at home in November 1969, at just 36.

The New York Times ran an obituary about the unexpected death of the promising political novice who, sadly, was lost in his prime.

Or was he?

Mr. O’Cummings was not quite the determined political up-and-comer that he seemed. He had faked his death and was very much alive when he bamboozled The Times and The Amsterdam News into publishing his obituary.
