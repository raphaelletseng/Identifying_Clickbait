One Direction's Louis Tomlinson Joins Zayn & Niall Horan on Hot 100  by   FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   YOUTUBE   PRINT   COMMENTS  What does the current Billboard Hot 100 , dated Dec. 31, 2016, have in common with the chart dated Jan. 29, 1977, nearly 40 years ago? The answer is related to two songs that debut on the latest tally. While former One Direction member Zayn 's "I Don't Wanna Live Forever," with Taylor Swift , blasts in at No. 6 , current 1D member Louis Tomlinson bows at No. 52 with "Just Hold On," with Steve Aoki . The collab enters the Digital Song Sales chart at No. 6 with 54,000 first-week downloads sold in the tracking week ending Dec. 15, according to Nielsen Music, while also drawing 3.6 million U.S. streams. The song marks Aoki's third Hot 100 entry and Tomlinson's first on his own, after 29 with One Direction.  Thus, two members of 1D (one past, one present) debut on the Hot 100 simultaneously. It's not the first time, however, that a boy band has seen multiple members enter the chart as soloists in the same week. On that Jan. 29, 1977-dated chart, for instance, The Beatles ' George Harrison and Ringo Starr bowed with "Crackerbox Palace" at No. 66 and "Hey Baby" at No. 90, respectively. That week marks the only time that two Beatles debuted simultaneously as soloists. (The Beatles, rounded out by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , charted 71 Hot 100 hits in 1964-96.)  Meanwhile, One Direction's Niall Horan ranks at No. 50 on the Hot 100 with his first solo hit, "This Town," which reached a No. 25 high on Oct. 22. Despite dropping from No. 41 (pushed down, in part, by a bevy of tracks by J. Cole that debut above it), "Town" gains in all metrics. It backtracks 17-18 on Digital Song Sales, but with a 17 percent gain to 33,000 sold; lifts 29-27 on Radio Songs (38 million in airplay audience, up 5 percent); and grows by 7 percent to 3.2 million U.S. streams.
