$2,000 Air Jordans Are Selling for $60 at Marshalls
Originally published on Sole Collector When you see these outlandish come up photos on social media, the typical response is to blow it off as a hoax. However, after digging through the rumors of the ultra-popular Fragment x Air Jordan 1 Retro surfacing at Marshalls stores, you'll find that there's validity to these unlikely circumstances. In the past week, several sneakerheads have walked into Marshalls and purchased the Fragment 1 for $59.99 — far less than its original $185 price tag and the $1,800 it commands on the resell market according to StockX . In fact, pairs have fetched as much as $2,000 on eBay in the past few months. People purchased pairs as recently as Friday, so while it's no guarantee, making a trip to your local Marshalls seems worth it. Oh snap I finally found one of these! Air Jordan 1 Fragments at Marshall's at Beverly Connection!!! They only had 8.5 but I'm going to make it work! #Jordan # #Fragment # A photo posted by Jason ( ) on Dec 16, 2016 at 1: PST Shout out to  and Thanks to there post I was alerted that got The Fragment Jordan Ones which I found two pairs of at my local store.
