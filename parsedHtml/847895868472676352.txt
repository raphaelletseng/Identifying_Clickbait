Fan Loses Bet on Warriors-Rockets, Gets Taped to Yield Sign, Explains to Cops
A photo posted by CHAVO (@ myhouseisclean ) This fan will never bet against the Golden State Warriors again. On Tuesday, a fan identified as Miguel Chavez by WFAA ABC was taped to a yield sign in Houston by his friends, who bet on the Warriors vs. Rockets game on Tuesday. Golden State won, and Chavez got taped. It was a strange wager, but it seemed good-natured—until the police got involved. People not in on the gag called the cops, and they pulled up as Chavez was approached by someone with a knife. It was one of the guys behind the tape job, but the officer didn't know. He threatened to use his taser but later helped Chavez down and gave him a ride home. The Rockets visit Oracle Arena for their second game against the Dubs this week. Double or nothing?
