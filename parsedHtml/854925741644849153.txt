Vanderbilt Football Team Stars in Sorority Recruitment Video Spoof
The Vanderbilt Commodores don't typically get the top high school football recruits, but all of that could change thanks to a sorority recruitment-like video. (Seriously.) Vanderbilt players got together and gave it their all, imitating the 2015 viral videos put out by University of Alabama's Alpha Phi sorority. From the matching shirts to group activities to the music, they made sure to cross off every box on the checklist. If a video like this doesn't draw recruits, nothing will. [ YouTube ]
