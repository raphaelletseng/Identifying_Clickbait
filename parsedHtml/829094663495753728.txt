White House list of supposedly underreported terror attacks includes Orlando, San Bernardino and Paris
The White House released a list of terrorist attacks to bolster President Trump’s claim that the press does not report on them. This list was published just hours after Trump implied the existence of an industrywide conspiracy within journalism during a speech to U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. “And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that,” Trump said. The commander in chief did not cite any evidence or data to support his claim, which seemed particularly jarring given that cable news often immediately launches into wall-to-wall coverage of major terrorist attacks. The Trump administration’s list of 78 supposedly underreported terrorist attacks, from September 2014 until December 2016, is noteworthy for naming incidents that received a tremendous amount of coverage and dominated the news cycle. These include the following (figures as presented on White House list): The coordinated terrorist attacks on Paris in November 2015 that killed at least 129 and wounded about 400. The coordinated bombings at Zaventem Airport and on a subway train in Brussels, Belgium, in March 2016 that killed at least 31 and wounded about 270. The truck attack in Nice, France, in July 2016 that killed 84 and wounded about 308. The shooting at a nightclub in Orlando in June 2016 that killed 49 and wounded about 53. The shootings and suicide bombings at Ataturk International Airport in Istanbul, Turkey, that killed 45 and wounded about 240. The list failed to include several terrorist attacks that were not carried out by Muslim extremists. Noteworthy absences include the June 2015 Charleston church shooting, in which a white supremacist murdered nine black parishioners, and last month’s Quebec City mosque shooting, which killed six Muslims and injured about 20. Critics on social media were quick to point out these absences. Did we lose the page on underreported terrorist attacks by white supremacists?

For instance, “attacker” is misspelled as “Attaker” 27 times, and “San Bernardino” is misspelled as “San Bernadino.” Two Southern California congressmen, both Democrats, pointed out the latter typo as a sign that the White House wasn’t paying enough attention to the issue.
