This Brave Fitness Blogger Reveals Her Hairy Legs and Armpits, After Not Shaving For a Year To Encourage Natural Beauty Morgan Mikenas finds comfort in promoting something that most women may cringe at just the thought doing to inspire people into embracing natural beauty. In her youtube video “Why I don’t shave” she mentions how she’s not suggesting that everyone should consider shaving their armpit and leg hair, but is trying to  Growing up, I just wanted to be like everyone else. I didn't value or understand the beauty in being different at the time. I have found that the things I get criticized for, which is usually being different and just doing my own thing and just being original, is what has made me successful. To me, success is love. Success is helping others and making an impact. Success is loving yourself. Success is loving what you do. Success is loving how you go about facing the challenges that life throws at you, and coming out on the other side better than you were before. Being different is normal. Being different is a good thing! It is what makes you who you are. Being different is freedom. You are one of a kind, and that is your power. Find what makes you stand out. What makes you different? Embrace that and just be happy:) Happy Friday😌🌞💜#befree #spreadlove #bebold #bedifferent #selfcare #positivity #inspireothers #bethechange #unity #weareone #onelove #allnatural #nomakeup #selflove #dreads #success #namaste #gratitude #divine #belovenow #bodyhairdontcare #happyfriday #healing #iloveyou #lovewhatyoudo #inspiration #lifeisbeautiful #passion #word A post shared by Morgan Mikenas (@i_am_morgie) on Apr 14, 2017 at 10:01am PDT Her Instagram account bustles with followers who embrace her idea of looking natural. Social media has such a great potential to spread love/positivity and create a positive communication link to people all over the world. But sadly, a lot of the time it is a battle ground where insults fly back and forth. Spreading hatred for entertainment.. Words have the potential to heal or to hurt. People don't realize how damaging social media can really be if used this way. It can destroy a persons self esteem and a persons sense of self worth. But on a positive note, I have connected with some really awesome people because of social media. Despite all the negativity that comes with it, there comes so much positivity/inspiration also. I am just feeling very thankful today for all of you who choose to spread kindness and uplift me and others every single day. I am so proud to have connected with like minded individuals who do what they love everyday and genuinely care. I appreciate you and I'm sure others do too. Thank you💜✨🌌🤘🏼#positivity #spreadlove #bethechange #selflove #gratitude #namaste #iloveyou #thankful #weareone #onelove #thankyou #changetheworld #alldoneup #nofilter #happystpattys A post shared by Morgan Mikenas (@i_am_morgie) on Mar 17, 2017 at 2:40pm PDT She reveals how she had been bullied for showing her hairy legs in school, when she was around 11 or 12, and how "There is nothing more rare, nor more beautiful, than a woman being unapologetically herself; comfortable in her perfect imperfection. To me, that is the true essence of beauty."~Steve Maraboli 🌸✨ Not just woman, but everyone! Imagine if everyone just decided that today was the day they loved themselves and embraced every part of them selves. Accepting and loving your body and your "flaws" because you know they are what makes you who you are. If you are focused on being true to yourself in every moment, you are less concerned what others think, which will lead to peace of mind. When you have nothing to hide and you can freely be yourself, there is a profound peace/confidence you will emanate to the world that will inspire others. ✨💝🤘🏼I also just posted a new YouTube video on why I don't shave my body hair and how it helped me(link in bio)☺ #bodypositive #spreadlove #behappy #namaste #hairywomen #healing #healthylifestyle #selfcare #loveyourself #beyourself #bethechange #divine #inspireothers #inspirationalquotes #positivity #goodvibesonly #lifeisbeautiful #hairy #gratitude #weareone #higherconsciousness #freespirit #empowerment #smile #feelgood A post shared by Morgan Mikenas (@i_am_morgie) on Mar 4, 2017 at 12:00pm PST   She finally managed to ditch her razor at the beginning of last year and hasn’t shaved her armpits or legs since then. It's just nice to embrace the natural beauty that you are.. the beauty that's on the inside AND the outside☺💙 What is beauty anyway? To me... it's to be beautiful before someone else told you what beautiful is supposed to be.. Just as you are, you are beautiful✨💞#bodyhairdontcare #fitness #bodypositive #spreadlove #gratitude #namaste #bethechange #beauty #hairywomen #empowerment #bebold #beyou #loveandlight #positivity #encouragement #onelove #freespirit #effyourbeautystandards #natural #physique #selfcare #selflove #fitnessmodel A post shared by Morgan Mikenas (@i_am_morgie) on Apr 11, 2017 at 7:31pm PDT You don't realize how far you've come until you look back at where it all started. The picture on the left was 2 years ago before I started getting into bodybuilding.. I was unhappy with many aspects of my life, mentally and physically.. I decided it was time for change... and never looked back. The picture on the right is me currently.. the same bikini, but happier/healthier/hairier me:) I am a completely new person inside and out, and I could not be more proud of myself.☺😌 Gaining muscle takes time, discipline, dedication, patience, and most of all consistency. Your are not going to see instant results and it's not going to happen overnight.. It is a long process.. BUT if you keep with it you can achieve anything you set your mind to!💗😎#fitness #fitnessjourney #namaste #spreadlove #change #abs #dedication #challenge #healthylifestyle #healthy #happy #consistency #bodypositive #goals #positivity #inspiration #bethechange #calisthenics #hairywomen #fitnessmotivation #getfit #loveyourself #transformation #bodybuilding #inspireothers #dreambig #fuzzy #bodyhairdontcare A post shared by Morgan Mikenas (@i_am_morgie) on Mar 6, 2017 at 4:08pm PST Also, the fact that her body got prickly, itchy, and uncomfortable after she shaved also put her off it.

Morgan Mikenas finds comfort in promoting something that most women may cringe at just the thought doing to inspire people into embracing natural beauty. She’s gone an entire year without removing the hair from her armpits and legs to show that embracing what you believe is nothing to be ashamed about.

In her youtube video “Why I don’t shave” she mentions how she’s not suggesting that everyone should consider shaving their armpit and leg hair, but is trying to inspire people into doing whatever they feel comfortable doing without any apprehensions.

Her Instagram account bustles with followers who embrace her idea of looking natural.

She reveals how she had been bullied for showing her hairy legs in school, when she was around 11 or 12, and how she went home to her mum later crying asking her if she could learn how to shave.

She finally managed to ditch her razor at the beginning of last year and hasn’t shaved her armpits or legs since then. She claims that one of the reasons for doing so has been the fact that it just takes so much time.

She came to the realisation that she doesn’t need to do this anymore when she took forever in the shower one day shaving everything and washing her hair and body afterwards.

She realised that she didn’t mind how soft and nice her hair felt once she let it grow out naturally. Also, the fact that her body got prickly, itchy, and uncomfortable after she shaved also put her off it.

Like Mikenas mentioned in one of her posts that it's up to us to decide and do what makes us comfortable, instead of listening to pre-conceived notions about how we need to look in society.
