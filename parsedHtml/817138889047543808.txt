The No. 2 entry on Page T2 about Atacama Desert, Chile, erroneously attributes a distinction to a telescope at a hotel there. It is one of the country’s largest privately owned telescopes, not its largest telescope.  The No. 14 entry on Page T2 about Penzance, England, describes its location incorrectly. Penzance is in the southwest part of the country, not the southeast. The No. 17 entry on Page T2A about Sikkim, India, misstates the year an airport is scheduled to open there. It is 2017, not 2018. The entry also refers incorrectly to Sikkim’s becoming the first fully organic state in India. It happened in 2015, not in 2016. The No. 30 entry on Page T2B about Chiang Mai, Thailand, misstates the year the X2 Chiang Mai Riverside Hotel is scheduled to open. It is 2017, not 2018. The No. 31 entry on Page T2B about Napa Valley, Calif., refers incorrectly to the ownership of the restaurant Two Birds/One Stone there. It is not owned by Kenzo Estate wines, which has a winery in the area. The entry, using information from a publicist, also refers incorrectly to the opening of Las Alcobas Hotel in Napa. It is scheduled to open later in January; it did not open in December 2016. The No. 47 entry on Page T11 about Laikipia, Kenya, misstates the number of suites at the Arijiju, a private-home retreat in Laikipia. There are fives suites, not 10. Advertisement
