This week’s gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos takes place against a backdrop of global political and economic uncertainty, the like of which we have arguably not seen for a generation.

The ramifications of the UK’s vote last June to leave the European Union are extensive, with positives and negatives for the UK economy. Later this week, across the Atlantic, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, possibly the most unlikely victor of all time.
