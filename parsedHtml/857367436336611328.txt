Starbucks and Target pair together like wine and cheese.                                   Target is sometimes more comfortable than your own home.                                   Cat and Jack is like a magnetic forcefield pulling you in.                                   And you usually forget the thing you came in for.                                   Got kids? Go to Target.                                   Target style is the best style.                                   Hands down. Look at these finds.                                   Target Red card for life.    I mean, you never know, you could be in there for hours.                                   Just so you can enjoy aisle time alone (we all need it).                                   It just makes sense.
