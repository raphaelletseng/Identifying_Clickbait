Juggling high-pressured jobs with starting families and maintaining social lives is leaving our generation highly anxious.

So what if there was a simple three-minute solution for clearing your mind and erasing your worries instantly?

According to Emmy-Lou Knowles, Mediation Coach and Intuitive Healer at www.youremmylou.com, there is - and anyone can master it.

According to Emmy-Lou Knowles, Mediation Coach and Intuitive Healer, there's a three-minute trick you can do at your desk to completely banish your worries

Speaking to FEMAIL, she explained: 'When worry kicks off and stress kicks in, you need to make space. You don’t need incense, candles or to be sat legs crossed on the floor – let’s be realistic.'

Emmy-Lou explains that all you need to do is close your eyes or simply stare at a fixed point if you are at your desk for example and place your feet flat on the floor for stability.

THE BREATHING RITUAL - In for one, out for one - In for two, out for two - In for three, out for three - In for four, out for four - In for five, out for five - In for six, out for six - In for seven, out for seven - In for eight and out for eight

Next, turn all focus to pulling in your breath, sucking the oxygen deep into your belly through the nose as though pulling breath in through two straws up the nostrils.

Then, simply sigh. 'A sigh is wonderful as it's effectively telling the body that we are going to hit the reset button on the pattern,' she said.

Then start counting the breath in and out through the nose as per the breathing ritual in the pink box.

Emmy Lou says you should repeat this eight times - or at whichever number feels good and comfortable for you - visualising and allowing the shoulders, eyes, mouth and brow to soften.
