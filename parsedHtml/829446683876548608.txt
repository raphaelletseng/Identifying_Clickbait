Harvard Book Store Creates Bowling Green Massacre Section
Harvard Book Store Creates Bowling Green Massacre Section
The people at Harvard Book Store want readers to remember the victims of the Bowling Green massacre. You know, that massacre that never happened ? Last week, Kellyanne Conway , an adviser to President Donald Trump , used the nonexistent massacre to justify Trump’s highly controversial immigration ban . So, Harvard Book Store clearly wanted to have a little bit of fun and created an area of their shop that includes literature that may appeal to readers looking to honor those “lost” in Bowling Green. The subtlety of this shade throwing is the best part.  #fromthebooksellers A photo posted by Harvard Book Store (@harvardbookstore) on by Robert O.

"Sex Object" by Jessica Valenti

Feminist blogger Jessica Valenti knew she would receive backlash for naming her memoir “Sex Object.” Despite the fact that no woman appreciates being demeaned to the status of an object, Valenti predicted that trolls would object to the name, claiming Valenti wasn’t attractive enough to deserve the dehumanizing title. And she was right. This is but one infuriating circumstance Valenti explores in her essay collection , which recalls with vulnerability and force the experience growing up a sex object first, a human being second. Readers might be surprised at how many of their own repressed memories bubble up reading Valenti’s account, how many times instances of misogyny have been laughed off or brushed under the rug. -Priscilla Frank
