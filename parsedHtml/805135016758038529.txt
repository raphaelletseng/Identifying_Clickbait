Story highlights Opposition vows to impeach Park Geun-hye next week over corruption scandal

Park's own party suggests instead she resign by April

(CNN) Embattled South Korean President Park Geun-hye faces an ultimatum from her own party: Announce a timeline for her resignation or face possible impeachment.

Park, who's been dogged by a classified information scandal involving a longtime friend, said earlier this week she would resign if that's what the National Assembly wants.

Many observers see stepping down as a way for Park to avoid the embarrassment of impeachment as opposition parties look to press ahead next week with a vote to unseat her.

Park stopped short of specifying a date for her resignation, leading some breakaway members of her Saenuri Party to ask her to set a timeline for her departure. Mainstream members of her party have stipulated that she must stand down by April 30, with a proposed presidential election in June. Her five-year term is set to end in February 2018.
