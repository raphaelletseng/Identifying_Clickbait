On their flight back home following their Wild Card Game loss to the Green Bay Packers, the New York Giants allegedly trashed their team plane, causing a massive delay for the passengers scheduled to use the aircraft next. According to the New York Post, United Airlines Flight 934 out of Green Bay landed in Newark at 2:17 a.m., and was expected to depart for Heathrow Airport in London at 8:30 a.m., but the plane didn't take off until 11:47 a.m.

As the London-bound passengers waited for answers, one passenger named Mark Kropf claims that they were informed that the Giants were to blame for the lengthy delay.

â€œUpon entering the business class cabin, the cleaning scent only partially masked the alcohol smell," Kropf said, per the Post. "I had popcorn, chewing tobacco and other food crumbs on my seat." The delay was a nightmare for most passengers, but for one person, it was actually a gift.
