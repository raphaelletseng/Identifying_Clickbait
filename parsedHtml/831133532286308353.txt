Katy Perry appeared to take a jibe at Britney Spears over her mental health not once but twice at last night's Grammy Awards.

On the red carpet, the California Gurls singer answered a question about having taken a break between albums by saying: "That's called taking care of your mental health".

When presenter Ryan Seacrest asked her how her time off had gone, she replied: "Fantastic. And I haven't shaved my head yet".

Ms Spears was pictured shaving her head after reportedly leaving rehab almost exactly a decade ago in February 2007.

The pop superstar, who entered a rehab facility after the incident and was later hospitalised and treated on a psychiatric ward, has since opened up about her struggles with anxiety.

She told Marie Claire about how she managed to overcome an ongoing sense of unease and apprehension.

“I moved to Los Angeles when I was very young,” she told the magazine. “I was so under scrutiny. If a hair was out of place, I'd be so anxious. I would get very anxious about so many things.”

Ms Perry, who has been involved in a long-running spat with Taylor Swift, also appeared to reference Ms Spears' public breakdown in another interview.
