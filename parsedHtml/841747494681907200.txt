10 Athletes That Should Have Signature Sneakers
10 Athletes That Should Have Signature Sneakers


Michael Jordan aside, Maya Moore has a case for being the biggest winner in Jordan Brand history. She's a three-time WNBA Champion, a EuroLeague Champion, Liga Femenina Champion, two-time Olympic gold medalist, two-time FIBA World Champion, and two-time NCAA Champion. And that's cutting her list of accomplishments short.

Because of her knack for leading teams to championships, Jordan Brand signed Maya Moore as its first female athlete in 2011. Since then, she's been given exclusive make-ups of various Air Jordans, but never the opportunity to lead her own. In a market that has been void of signature women's product since Candace Parker's last Adidas model in 2011, Moore is the right woman to get the next call. With Jordan's history of breaking the mold and Nike taking over WNBA apparel rights next season, now is the time to get another women's-specific Air Jordan on shelves.
