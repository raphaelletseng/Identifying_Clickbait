Letters: Southern could end rail travellers’ misery by taking resolute action

IR – The answer to the chaos for Southern railway users lies wholly within Southern’s power. By taking strike action , its workers are breaking their employment contracts. Southern could dismiss them all. Provided it dismissed all who take action and did not re-employ (that is, did not selectively dismiss troublemakers), it would be protected from claims of unfair dismissal. Of course, unless it has a ready supply of trained drivers, it won’t be able to provide much of a service, but then it isn’t doing that anyway. The alternative is to drop its demand to remove guards from trains until such time as it can muster resources to make the change without jeopardising provision of a decent service.
