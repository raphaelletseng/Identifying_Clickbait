Chrissy Teigen Already Gave Out The Cutest Award Of Oscar Night
pic.twitter.com/SUAa6lePZi         In Chrissy Teigen ’s mind, the Oscar for cutest baby was no contest. Before heading to the 89th annual Academy Awards , the model and mom decided to have some award show fun on social media. “And the award for Baby of the Year goes to ... baby Luna!” Teigen says in a video posted to Twitter Sunday. We’re guessing the statue in the video is the one Teigen’s husband John Legend won for his song “Glory,” created with Common for the film “Selma.” (Luna’s will probably come in the mail.) Clearly, this is a major upset for all other babies hoping to snag the win this year, but let’s be honest: Baby Luna put out some outstanding work in the last year.
