Closing the Gap report: What is the Redfern Statement?

Posted

Indigenous leaders will today hand Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull their blueprint for improvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.

It is called the Redfern Statement and is backed by more than 50 organisations.

What is the Redfern Statement?

The Redfern Statement was released during last year's election campaign as an "urgent call for a more just approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs".

The 18-page manifesto proposed dozens of changes across a range of areas, including health, education, justice and family violence.

What does it call for?

Policies to be made with communities — rather than to communities

More than $500 million cut from Indigenous Affairs in the 2014 budget to be restored

Support for justice reinvestment — where money is redirected to address underlying causes of crime

Creating a standalone department for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Indigenous Affairs is currently within the Prime Minister's Department)

Which organisations signed it?

The statement was spearheaded by the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples.

Seventeen other Indigenous groups signed it, including the First People's Disability Network, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations.

They were joined by mainstream organisations including Amnesty International, the Australian Council of Social Service, Australian Medical Association, Law Council of Australia and Oxfam Australia.
