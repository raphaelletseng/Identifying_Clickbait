Alexis Sanchez displays fat lip after 'embarrassing' reaction to having ball thrown in his face
lexis Sanchez was in the wars on Wednesday night as Arsenal scraped their way past Leicester at the Emirates Stadium. The Chilean was involved in a late fracas with Leicester's Christian Fuchs, as the visiting player attempted several times to take a throw in while Sanchez blocked his path. Fuchs, his side having just gone behind through a Robert Huth own goal , eventually lost patience, and directed his throw directly at Sanchez at close quarters. As if Sanchez hadn't taken enough fire for the evening, he was then roundly assailed by fans on social media for his reaction. Having flinched from the contact, the forward then turned and appeared to check if the referee was looking, before collapsing to the turf and holding his face. HAHAHA Sanchez. pic.twitter.com/fTsMxyUPG4 he ball appeared to catch the Arsenal man on his shoulder, but whatever the case may be he was booked for his actions. Feliz por la victoria pero termine con el labio hinchado 😂😢happy for the victory but ended up with a swollen lip 😂😂👍🏼⚽️ pic.twitter.com/0y301Ztnp9 There's possibility that ball hit a nerve on his shoulder which then sent message to brain....to act like a pudding. https://t.co/SkuA6tXk1v What can you say about Sanchez that hasnt already been said 😂 Embarrassing The 'delayed-fall-and-face-clutch' routine was reminiscent of that employed by Brazilian star Rivaldo in the 2002 World Cup semi-final against Turkey. n that occasion, far from receiving the same punishment as Sanchez, Rivaldo managed to get his opponent sent off – despite only having had the ball kicked against his thigh. Just seen the Sanchez 'Rivaldo' moment. Absolutely pathetic. Embarrassing. @anthonydavid41  @georgiebingham I think you need to see a replay before replying, he made two attempts to throw it, hence the refs instructions to Sanchez to move. rsenal moved back up to sixth in the Premier League with their 1-0 win, as they look to keep alive their hopes of finishing in the top four.
