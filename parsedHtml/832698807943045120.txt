Twitter Absolutely Lit Up the Warriors for Their All-Star Photo Shoot
For some reason, the Golden State Warriors decided to do another team photo shoot . The results—just like last season—brought out the slander on social media. In fact, it may have been even worst this time around because of all the 3-1 jokes. The actual reason for the latest Warriors shoot was to celebrate their four All-Stars: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. As soon as the pics hit Twitter though, the slander came in, and was ruthless. At least Steph is a good sport: @StephenCurry30  pic.twitter.com/or8wANSgjg This is too much.
