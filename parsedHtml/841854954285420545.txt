Australian woman released after Kabul kidnapping last November

Posted

An Australian aid worker who was kidnapped in Afghanistan has been released.

The woman was abducted in November last year in the Afghan capital Kabul.

Local media reported at the time that she was taken at gunpoint.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has issued a statement confirming the woman is now free.

It did not provide any information about how, or why, the woman was released.

"We thank the authorities in Afghanistan for their support and assistance. The Australian Government has provided ongoing consular support," DFAT said.

"[The woman's] family welcomes her safe return and asks that the media respect their privacy at this time."

Afghanistan has been plagued by kidnappings, with several foreign aid workers being taken, including Australians.

Kerry Jane Wilson, who was abducted from the office of a charity in the eastern city of Jalalabad, was freed in August last year.

But another Australian working as a teacher at the American University in Kabul was kidnapped, along with an American colleague, in the same month.

Ransom is often the motive for abductions in Afghanistan, but the Government has not said if that applies in this case.

The Government has been reticent to reveal information about kidnappings, arguing that drawing attention to them will only encourage further abductions in the region.
