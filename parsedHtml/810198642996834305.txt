As the sports community mourns the loss of broadcaster Craig Sager, who died Thursday from acute myeloid leukemia, one gamer found an inventive way to honor his legacy.

Da InFaMous NY posted a video tutorial on his YouTube channel to create "Sager Strong" uniforms and a court design in NBA 2K17. The jerseys, which commemorate his renowned fashion flair, are similar to warm-up shirts worn by the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday night.

The custom court features the reporter's face at the center with "#SagerStrong" on the baselines.
