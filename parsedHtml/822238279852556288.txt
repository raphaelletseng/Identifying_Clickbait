Adidas Confirms Black/Red Yeezy Boost Release Date


What's coming from Kanye West's Adidas Yeezy Boost line in 2017? According to leaker account Yeezy Mafia, this black/red Adidas Yeezy 350 Boost V2 will be the first pair to release in the new year. Yeezy Mafia is pegging the shoe as a Feb. 11 release.

Adidas Yeezy Boost release dates are always volatile, so there's a good chance these will show up before or after Feb. 11, but Yeezy Mafia's info is generally pretty accurate.

This new Adidas Yeezy 350 Boost V2 style is the first of the V2 releases to arrive without any stripes across the side. The shoe has the "SPLY-350" detailing like previous V2s and uses the same updated build.
