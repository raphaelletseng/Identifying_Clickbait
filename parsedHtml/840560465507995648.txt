Funeral Home Staffers' Sharp Eyes Lead to Murder Charges

Police say keen observation by funeral home staff led to murder charges against a Baltimore man accused of strangling his mother.

Police said Friday that officers responding to a report of a suspicious death Wednesday found 63-year-old Cathy Kuhn unresponsive. Since there were no visual signs of trauma, police say the medical examiner's office declined to investigate.

Police say the body was sent to a funeral home, where staff discovered possible signs of trauma. The Baltimore Sun reports the statement of charges identifies the home as the Leonard J. Ruck Funeral Home.

Police say that an investigation showed Kuhn's son, 32-year-old Erich Kuhn, strangled his mother at her home. He was arrested Thursday.

Online court records show Kuhn was charged Friday with murder, assault and a weapons offense.
