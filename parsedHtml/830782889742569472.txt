Reports of the MHA web portal getting hacked emerged on Sunday morning. A PTI tweet also said that the MHA website was hacked. The PTI tweet quoted home ministry officials as saying that the website was hacked "prompting the authorities to temporarily block it."

As soon as the hacking was detected, the MHA website was immediately blocked by the National Informatics Centre. Computer emergency response teams are looking into the incident, an official said. "We are not sure about the website being hacked. Pending investigation by the NIC, the website has been blocked," the officials said.
