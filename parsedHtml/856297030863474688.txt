Draymond Green can oftentimes be an overlooked member of the Golden State Warriors' Big 4. What do you expect when you have two-time MVP Steph Curry, fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson, and 2014 league MVP and eight-time All-Star Kevin Durant? But, in a 2016-17 campaign where Green stepped his game up to possibly warrant this year's Defensive Player of the Year award, he also accomplished things that didn't necessarily show up in the box score.

True basketball fans know that Draymond isn't just the heart of the Warriors, he's the engine that keeps this machine going on both sides of the ball. So, it's hard to imagine him being humble about his importance to the team and accomplishments throughout the season. It's probably why a song like "Humble" by Kendrick Lamar speaks to Draymond.

In a video posted by Athletes Underground, we get to see Green play the role of K. Dot as he raps about how hard it is to be humble. "This year it’s clear I sacrificed points scoring for my teammates / Scoring less but still I’m breaking records while I’m losing points / First triple double ever done not including points," the animated Green raps, referencing his triple double against the Memphis Grizzles where he had 12 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, and only four points.

Every night Draymond finds a way to amaze us with one highlight play or another, which is why the line "My steals and my blocks going viral" makes perfect sense.
