With a little over three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter of Monday night's game against the Orlando Magic , the Minnesota Timberwolves held a 94-92 lead. The 21-year-old Wiggins enhanced his squad's advantage with a thunderous dunk on Magic center Nikola Vucevic . Although Orlando forced overtime, Minnesota salvaged a 111-105 win behind Wiggins' game-high 27 points. This bucket, however, proved the most memorable as a Dunk of the Year candidate. Since Zach LaVine won't defend his crown in this year's Slam Dunk Contest, perhaps it's time for his teammate to step in. Like the new article format? Send us feedback ! Where can I comment?
