A Dance Troupe Adds Fresh Faces. The Youngest Is 66.
A Dance Troupe Adds Fresh Faces. The Youngest Is 66.
“Keep the arms heavy, feel the weight of the step,” the choreographer Larissa Velez-Jackson called to her performers, a group of women ages 66 to 87, as they practiced walking like runway models in a studio at New York Live Arts. Every few steps, they paused as if posing for a camera, throwing sultry glances toward the front of the room. “I think we’re liking getting our picture taken,” Ms. Velez-Jackson said approvingly, strolling among them. She was leading a rehearsal of “ Give It to You Stage ,” a two-act song-and-dance extravaganza that opens at Live Arts on Wednesday. The show is a project of Yackez , the performance art duo that is Ms. Velez-Jackson, 40, and her husband, Jon Velez-Jackson, 39. He brings the songwriting background — the two write and produce all their own music — while she brings the choreographic expertise. “Stage,” their largest-scale production to date, compiles old and new numbers into a semiautobiographical musical, addressing topics ranging from couples’ therapy and date night to the grind of getting by as artists in New York. The Velez-Jacksons play Twitta and Papi Jon, a pair of aspiring pop stars crossed with themselves. Since its first show in 2011, Yackez has brought a vaudevillian cast of characters into its orbit, with a growing entourage of backup dancers — billed as a “queer pro wrestling dance ensemble” — bolstering the pair’s raucous performances. “There’s a fluidity in the way that they allow people to inhabit the work, and also a specificity,” said Laurie Berg, who performs the role of Coach, Twitta’s masked bodyguard. For “Stage,” the troupe expands further to include 11 women from Ms. Velez-Jackson’s parallel life as a fitness instructor for older adults, a career that predates the founding of Yackez. Many of them have never danced in a professional context. Advertisement “It’s really scary to get up onstage — I’ve never done it,” said Pearl Frisch, 76. “But you get into a rut and a routine as you get older, and I just thought, time to do something I’m afraid to do.” Ms. Velez-Jackson has long planned to integrate her fitness teaching and performance work. “Yackez is a family project — if you think of the originators, husband and wife — and they’re my dance family,” she said over coffee with Mr. Velez-Jackson recently, referring to her aerobics students at the West Side Y.M.C.A., the 92nd Street Y and Goddard Riverside Community Center. “It’s the dancing I’m doing every day, the community I’m working with every day.” Advertisement Bringing her students into “Stage” meant introducing them to the Yackez aesthetic, in which hip-hop, physical comedy, tango, wrestling, rap, drag performance, improvisation and aerobics, among other influences, collide to produce a purposeful kind of chaos. While she tried to keep their material simple, not far from what they would do in an aerobics class, the transition from exercise studio to stage has taken time. “The tasks vary depending on the song,” Ms. Velez-Jackson said. “For some, it’s a silly conga line, and other times I just want a stark presence. To me, that’s the hard stuff: How do you maintain, especially someone who’s potentially never performed before, a stark, confident presence on a big stage with all of this chaos around you?” Advertisement For Ms. Frisch, one challenge was learning to lead in a tango. But even for those with more dance experience, like Sharon Flanagan, who has been in ballroom dance competitions, there’s been a learning curve. “Larissa teaches the art of performing,” said Ms. Flanagan, 75, “so it’s not just get up and do the moves, which I’ve done in the past. It’s about where your focus is, being aware and present in a certain way.” Advertisement While Ms. Velez-Jackson worried that her students might not like the Yackez sound , which tends to be more abrasive, with more explicit lyrics, than the salsa and soul she plays in class, she said that they had been overwhelmingly receptive. Ms. Frisch said, “I think it’s maybe a stereotype that old people are going to be offended by the use of certain words or concepts, and that’s not necessarily true.” Advertisement Mr. Velez-Jackson — a journalist when he’s not making digital beats — has been working more closely with the younger backup dancers, orchestrating wrestling matches inspired by the theatrics of the WWE, an obsession that he and Ms. Velez-Jackson share. “We’re big on entertainment, wouldn’t you say?” he said, looking at her. “Like, it’s O.K. to have fun at a dance performance. It can be surreal and weird and still funny.” For all the jokes about fame and failure that run through Yackez’s lyrics, they’ve won some devoted fans. As one new dancer said of Ms. Velez-Jackson during rehearsal: “We’re her followers, her groupies. That’s what we’re doing here.” An earlier version of this article misstated the last name of one of the dancers. She is Sharon Flanagan, not Sharon Fogarty. A version of this article appears in print on March 29, 2017, on Page C2 of the with the headline: From Senior Aerobics Class to the Stage.  We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
