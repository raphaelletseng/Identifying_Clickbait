Duke Guard Grayson Allen Comes Close to Tripping Boston College Defender
Someone's gotta teach Grayson Allen to stop sticking his leg out everytime he bumps an opponent. #Duke #BC https://t.co/tO1WKGb5Ue Grayson Allen has a reputation for tripping opponents, which led to an " indefinite " suspension. The Duke guard did so in two separate incidents last year, finally getting suspended indefinitely after kicking down Elon's Steven Santa Ana on December 21. However, after only one game out—and a loss for Duke against Virginia Tech—Allen was back. By Saturday's contest against Boston College, he appeared to extend his leg while fighting through a screen, causing another player to stumble during the first half in a 93-82 win at Cameron Indoor Stadium.

Grayson Allen has a reputation for tripping opponents, which led to an "indefinite" suspension.

The Duke guard did so in two separate incidents last year, finally getting suspended indefinitely after kicking down Elon's Steven Santa Ana on December 21.

However, after only one game out—and a loss for Duke against Virginia Tech—Allen was back.

By Saturday's contest against Boston College, he appeared to extend his leg while fighting through a screen, causing another player to stumble during the first half in a 93-82 win at Cameron Indoor Stadium.

It wasn't blatant, but Allen may find himself under the microscope again.
