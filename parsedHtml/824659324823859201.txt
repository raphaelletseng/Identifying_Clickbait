The 'Going Clear' director is making a documentary about ousted Fox News boss Roger Ailes


Alex Gibney, the prolific filmmaker behind the Scientology documentary "Going Clear," has set his eyes on ousted Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes.

Gibney isÂ staying tight-lipped about the planned film.

"As a matter of course, I don't talk about what I'm working on," the directorÂ told the Hollywood Reporter, which broke news of the project.

According to the trade magazine, the Ailes documentary is in development and hasn't yet been placed with a network.

In July of last year, Ailes, 76, found himself embroiled in controversy after anchor Gretchen Carlson alleged that he sexually harassed herÂ while working at the Fox News Channel. Many other women then came forward with similar allegations, including now-former FNC anchor Megyn Kelly. Ailes resignedÂ from his positionÂ at the cable news channel later that same month.Â

In August, news surfaced that he was advising Donald Trump on his presidential campaign in advance of the aired debates.

Gibney, who has directed nearly 40 projects over his career, made a bigger name for himselfÂ in 2015 with the HBO documentary "Going Clear," inspired byÂ the book about Scientology's beliefs and alleged abuses of the same name byÂ Lawrence Wright. The movie went on to win three Emmys. Last year, Gibney told Business Insider that he was thinking aboutÂ a "Going Clear" sequel.
