Star Wars: What do fans make of the trailer for The Last Jedi?

Updated

The first trailer for Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi dropped overnight, and fans have big expectations for the follow-up to 2015's The Force Awakens.

In the two-minute clip, we see the reclusive Luke Skywalker training Rey to use a lightsaber on his island hideaway; we catch a glimpse from behind of General Leia Organa, the character played by the late Carrie Fisher; and we hear the words "the dark side" as we see Kylo Ren's mask shattered on the ground.

There's also the mandatory space-laser dogfights featuring TIE Fighters and X-Wings, as well as a cryptic reference to "The Balance" along with a shot of what looks like some sort of ancient, time-worn Jedi text.

But the bulk of the attention has been on this line from Skywalker:

"I only know one truth. It's time for the Jedi to end."

Hopefully we can assume Luke isn't about to finally follow in the footsteps of his Sith Lord father Darth Vader, but we'll have to wait until December 14 when the film finally releases to find out what he actually means.

Whatever the case, while the tone of The Last Jedi seems less than optimistic, Star Wars fans are hyped.
