It was in winter 2013, that Muffler Man aka Arvind Kejriwal was first elected Chief Minister of Delhi for the first time. It was a first-of-a-kind victory seen in India. Winter came and went and so did Kejriwal's first stint as Delhi's CM. In 2014 December, he became the single dominating voice against BJP in Delhi. His campaigns and cleanups became legends. After returning to power as Delhi's CM for the second time in February 2015, and a number of u-turns, December 2015 saw the launch of the historic odd-even formula. The boldest step taken to promote the use of public transport and reduction of pollution. It remains to be seen what December 2016 has in store, now that the muffler is back! As the man himself suggests, take care!
