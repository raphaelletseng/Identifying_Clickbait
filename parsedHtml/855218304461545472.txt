Billy Bush apparently will do anything to get back on TV ― even humiliate himself with an Instagram video that can only be described as “creepy.”

The video posted on Wednesday shows the former “Access Hollywood” and “Today Show” personality getting a haircut while singing an odd ode to himself that seems to be a rewrite of “Look At Me, I’m Sandra Dee” from “Grease.”

Look at me, I’m Billy B. / Trying to get back on TV / My hair is long and flat / And makes me look fat / And I can’t be — I’m Billy B.

Mere words don’t do it justice.

Bush was canned from “The Today Show” back in October after a 2005 hot-mic recording showed him engaging in a vulgar conversation with then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.

The recording is infamous for Trump’s comments that a star can do anything with a woman even “grab them by the pussy.”

A day after the recording became public, Bush apologized, saying he was “embarrassed and ashamed,” and added, “I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I’m very sorry.”
