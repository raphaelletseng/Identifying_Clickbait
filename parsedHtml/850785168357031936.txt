NRA Employee Accidently Shoots Himself at NRA Firearms Training Session
An employee of the National Rifle Association accidently shot himself Thursday at the organization’s headquarters in Virginia. According to , the 46-year-old man was participating in a firearms training session conducted at the NRA’s National Firearms Museum. Police said the employee was holstering the pistol when he accidently discharged it, which resulted in a minor wound to “the lower body.” The man, who has yet to be identified, was immediately transported to the hospital for treatment. Officers said they do not expect any charges to be filed. It’s unclear if the man was leading the firearms training or if he was simply being trained. The NRA—the nation’s largest and most prominent gun rights organization—has consistently stressed the importance of firearm safety through education. The official website states: “[W]e offer a variety of programs and services to promote the safe handling, use and storage of firearms. Whether you’re a parent in search of information about firearm safety in the home, a first-time gun owner, or an old pro looking to brush up on your firearm handling skills, the NRA is here to keep you and your family safe.” Of course, Thursday’s incident underscored the dangers firearms pose, even when handled under the NRA’s watch … by an NRA employee … at the NRA headquarters. Twitter went in: @TIME An accidental shooting by an NRA member? Irony can be so painful. A marksman for sure! @stephenfry  @maxlobaev NRA HQ self-shooting is simply a statistical probability, which is also the argument against volumes of guns. @WhoIsDEF  @NRA Question no one asked: why did he have a loaded gun, for a DEMO, in a room FULL of people?

Sandy Hook kids...no. @thehill It's a guilty pleasure, but I smile whenever I read about an NRA supporter "accidently" shooting themselves in the ass... The irony in working for the NRA and shooting yourself accidentally is really funny. 😂😂 https://t.co/WKuj3X3NrN A man accidentally shot himself at the headquarters of the NRA and shame on all of you for enjoying that story as much as I dd.
