This Adorable And Friendly Quokka Can't Get Enough Of The Man Who Took A Selfie With Him While on a bike ride on Rottnest Island, off the coast of Western Australia with his girlfriend, 21-year-old Campbell Jones spotted a quokka. 48km to reach every corner of #rottnest in one day #gopro #exploreperth #wa #perthfect #perthisok #perth #gopro_wa A post shared by Campbell Jones (@cambojones2020) on Jan 23, 2017 at 11:46pm PST   Knowing them to be the cute, fuzzy creatures they are, he proceeded to click a selfie with the furball using his GoPro camera. A post shared by Campbell Jones (@cambojones2020) on Jan 23, 2017 at 4:15am PST   Pulling this off wasn't much of a task since it's known to be the 'happiest animal on earth.'
