Lightning struck a tree and seemingly opened up the gates of Hell
Lightning struck a tree and seemingly opened up the gates of Hell
If this isn't some sort of sign, we don't know what is. According to The Weather Network , Mississippi and Alabama experienced severe storms this past weekend, including at least three reported tornados. In the aftermath of the storms, Janis Melton took this photo of a tree burning from the inside out after being struck by lightning in Baldwyn, Mississippi. Alabama meteorologist extraordinaire James Spann tweeted the photo, and oh dear God nature has opened up the fiery gates of Hell. This tree was hit by lightning in Baldwyn, MS. It burned the inside.
