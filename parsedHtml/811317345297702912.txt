Welcome the Dallas Cowboys' newest coach... pic.twitter.com/ccrNPTLiWt The Dallas Cowboys made a splash by enlisting former wrestling legend Sting to teach the art of intimidation. In a spoof of a "This is " commercial, the recently retired Hall of arrived at the office with his signature face paint, trench coat and baseball bat. Maybe that's where the Carolina Panthers , who may have implemented his techniques against the New York Giants , got the idea. The Panthers won that game, so perhaps the Cowboys "hired" The Icon in hopes of replicating the tactics on their division rivals. Having handed the Cowboys their only two losses of the season, perhaps the G-Men got help from star Seth Rollins, who beat Sting in his final match. [ Dallas Cowboys ]
