Prison bus runs over a corrections officer PRETENDING to be injured


A security exercise ended in tragedy when a Colombian corrections officer was run over by a bus in front of hundreds of students.

German Andrade was taking part in a drill to show how to respond to an attack on a prison transfer.

He plays the part of a wounded officer, and falls to the ground as fellow officers rush to cover around him, responding to 'gunfire'.

But as the bus meant to evacuate the group pulls up it runs over Andrade, who's still lying wounded on the ground.

Hundreds of students watched as the gruesome spectacle unfolded.

Andrade, a 19-year veteran of Colombia's prison service was rushed to hospital, where he died from his injuries.

Local media reported he was at the school so he could reach the rank of lieutenant.

The exercise was designed to show students how to safely transfer a wanted prisoner

Colombia's National Penitentiary and Prison Institute confirmed the incident had taken place and said an investigation was underway.

In a statement they added: 'It's important to note that these type of theoretical and practical exercises form part of the required curriculum.'

Colombia's Correction's Officer Union said they were mourning the loss of German Andrade.
