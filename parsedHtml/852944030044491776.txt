Victoria's Secret announced its list of 'What Is Sexy' and it's the worst
When👏 will👏 this👏 brand👏 learn👏 it👏 is👏 toxic👏 ? Victoria's Secret , the world's most misguided authority on sexiness, released its annual " What is Sexy " list, and (spoiler alert!) it's exactly what you think it is. Young, white, and thin. SEE ALSO: What models of diverse identities really think of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show The results were reportedly were decided by the public, though the website announcing the list's winners proudly declares, “This is what sexy means to us." While the list has a winners that stray from the above precedent, the numbers are unquestionably stacked in favor of thin white women. Mandy Moore tops the list for "sexiest actress," Taylor Swift for "sexiest entertainer," Lady Gaga for "sexiest songstress," and Lauren Conrad for "sexiest mogul." Sigh.

Yes, Vanessa Hudgens won "sexist style risk taker," Priyanka Chopra won "sexiest red carpet look," and Jamie Chung won "sexiest festival style," but what even those categories? While thin white women top the list in their professional field, women of color win nonsensical categories like "sexiest festival style." It's invalidating, VS (do better).

Beyond the lack of racial diversity amongst winners: there is no - repeat - size diversity on the list, a complaint about the company's 2016 winners that was apparently ignored. Thin is still (all that's) in, according to Victoria's Secret. We probably shouldn't be surprised considering the brand's consistently homogenously-sized annual fashion show.
