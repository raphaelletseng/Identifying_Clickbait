Saudi Arabia calls an end to tax-free living as oil slump continues to bite
Saudi Arabia ’s government cabinet has approved the introduction of a value added tax, signalling an end to tax-free living in the Gulf state whose economy has been squeezed by a dramatic fall in the price of oil. According to , a 5 per cent levy will apply to certain goods following an agreement that the country struck with the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council in June last year.   Saudi Arabia sets out plan to wean itself off oil by 2020 Saudis and those living in the country have for years been exempt from paying taxes, but a slump in the price of oil in recent years has sparked a search for ways to generate revenue. Oil has suffered a steady decline since the beginning of 2014, when it was trading well above $100 (£80) a barrel. It plunged to around $29 a barrel in January last year and has more recently recovered to hover around the $55 mark. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of oil and has already been forced to shelve major investments and cut government pay in response to the collapse in crude. Last year, the country recorded a budget deficit of $97bn according to AFP.
