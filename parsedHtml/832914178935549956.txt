Mapped: The countries that quaff the most wine per capita
Mapped: The countries that quaff the most wine per capita
omorrow is National Drink Wine Day , an American invention that Telegraph Travel wholeheartedly believes is worth celebrating on UK shores too. But which nationalities need absolutely no excuse to tuck into a nice bottle of plonk? The map above shows the world according to wine consumption per capita. Those countries or territories that appear in darker colours drink the most, those in lighter colours drink the least. So which country takes the crown? The proud title of most fervent vino guzzler goes to Andorra. According to the Wine Institute , the country consumed 3,936,000 litres of wine in 2014 (the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics are available). Given that just 69,165 people call the Pyrenean principality home, according to the UN, that's an impressive 56.9 litres per head. Or the equivalent of 76 bottles. Minors, we can only assume, are not contributing to that figure. So it's fair to suggest that the average Andorran adult consumes even more. However, the figure may also be bolstered by visitors to the country. Andorra is a popular ski destination and tax haven. A good deal of that consumption could be in the form of après-ski and duty-free shopping. Second on the list is the Vatican City, where 56.2 litres of wine are consumed per capita. We'll put that down to the frequency of Holy Communion, not Pope Francis's drinking habits. Croatia , Portugal and (quelle surprise) France complete the top five. The UK, where 21.3 litres are polished off per person, languishes in 29th. The US consumes more wine than any other country – 3,217,500,000 litres in 2014 – but that's just 9.9 litres per capita, putting it 55th overall. European countries dominate the upper end of the table, with Slovenia, Macedonia, Switzerland and Italy all in the top 10, and Austria, Greece, Romania, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, Malta, Spain and Belgium in the top 30. Caribbean nations also score highly, with winter sun tourists surely helping Aruba, the Cayman Islands and Sint Maarten crack the top 40. And a little of the Gallic love of wine has clearly rubbed off on Saint Pierre and Miquelon, 10th overall. 20 destinations that drink the most wine per capita Andorra - 56.9 litres Vatican City - 56.2 Croatia - 46.9 Portugal - 43.7 France - 43.1 Slovenia - 42.5 Macedonia - 40.4 Falkland Islands - 38.5 Switzerland - 37 Italy - 34.1 Saint Pierre and Miquelon - 32.7 Moldova - 30.7 Austria - 29.4 Uruguay - 28.1 Greece - 27.5 Romania - 27.4 Saint Helena - 25.8 Bermuda - 25.8 Sweden - 25.7 Germany - 25 At the other end of the scale are, unsurprisingly, Muslim countries. Pakistan consumes the least per capita: 0.00019 litres. Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria and Bangladesh follow. Three times more wine is consumed in the Falkland Islands (population 2,912) each year (112,000 litres) than in the whole of Pakistan (population 192,826,502). 10 destinations that drink the least wine per capita Pakistan - 0.00019 litres Yemen - 0.00022 Afghanistan - 0.00075 Syria - 0.0008 Bangladesh - 0.0012 Eritrea - 0.00168 Egypt - 0.00241 Sudan - 0.00269 Tajikistan - 0.00277 Saudi Arabia - 0.00354
