Justin Theroux Just Posted A Pic For Jennifer Aniston's Birthday And OUR HEARTS ARE MELTING
Guys, I’m crying and it’s because my Jennifer Aniston-loving heart can’t handle Justin Theroux’s cuteness. In honor of Aniston’s birthday, the actor — AKA her husband, NEVER FORGET THESE TWO ANGELS ARE MARRIED — posted an adorable pic of the two of them together. Is she blowing a kiss? Is he wearing a necklace? Is he smiling because she just told a funny joke because she is so funny? Is he smiling because his heart can’t handle how much he loves her? OR IS HE SMILING BECAUSE OF BOTH OF THOSE VERY IMPORTANT THEORIES? Oh, and he captioned the photo “HBDJ<3 XO.” I mean, COME ON. HE IS LITERALLY TOO COOL TO SPELL OUT “HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JENNIFER.” THIS IS HOW WE SHOULD KNOW THAT HE IS DESERVING OF HER BECAUSE SHE DESERVES ALL OF THE COOL GUYS. Of course, as we all know, this is a very important picture because Theroux and Aniston are basically the most private people ever and they almost never let us bathe in the warm sunlight of their love. For real, the last time Aniston showed up on his Instagram was 30 weeks ago, which means we should treasure this photo because it is extremely rare to see Theroux and Aniston in the wild, AKA social media. So take it in, JenJus/JusJen stans, because this image is probably going to have to last you a long time.   28 People Who Can't Believe Beyoncé Really Didn't Perform...
