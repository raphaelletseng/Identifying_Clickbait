'Fresh Prince' Cast Reunited and, of Course, Fans Became Emotional
Prepare to feel all kinds of nostalgic. Earlier this week, Will Smith reunited with cast nearly 20 years after the sitcomâ€™s final episode aired. Actor Alfonso Ribeiro, who portrayed Willâ€™s cousinÂ Calrton Banks, shared the moment on Instagram, writing: "Always amazing to spend an afternoon with my Fresh Prince family. Wishing that James Avery (Uncle Phil) was still with us to make this complete." As you can see in the picture above, Tatiana Ali, Karyn Parsons, Daphne Maxwell Reid, and Joseph Marcell joined Smith and Ribeiro. TMZ reports the cast came together to support Parsonâ€™s Sweet Blackberry organization, which produces short animated films about African-American history. Twitter predictably freaked out about the reunion, with many people crossing their fingers for a revival . Unfortunately for the hopeful fans, a reboot doesn't seem likely . This photo is probably the closest thing we'll get. the fresh prince of bel air reunion makes me so emosh :( I finished watching the fresh prince series and this reunion picture was uploaded by alfonso (carlton) ðŸ˜© i'm a wreck ðŸ’– pic.twitter.com/EPLMw6Kyjh Saw that Fresh Prince reunion pic today almost shed a tear...
