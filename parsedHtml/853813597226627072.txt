Courageous is an understated way to describe Isaiah Thomas' efforts in the Boston Celtics' Game 1 loss to the Chicago Bulls on Sunday night at TD Garden.

Thomas, the star and natural leader of the Eastern Conference's top seed, could have sat this one out. No one forced him to suit up and take the court one day after the news broke that his younger sister, Chyna, had passed away in a car accident early Saturday back in his home state of Washington. But Thomas answered the call and made the decision to play alongside his teammates.

Thomas had an impressive performance, scoring a game-high 33 points. Afterward, many people took to the internet to express their support for IT4.
