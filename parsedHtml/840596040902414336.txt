South Korea impeachment: Protesters take to the streets after ruling - BBC News


Thousands of demonstrators turned out for rallies in Seoul on Saturday, a day after three people involved in protests died there.

Many were calling for the arrest of impeached South Korean leader Park Geun-hye, although a smaller number of her supporters also gathered in nearby streets.

Fears that the two sides may clash have led to a heavy police presence in Seoul.
