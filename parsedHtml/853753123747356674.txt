16 Parchment-Wrapped Dinners For People Who Hate Dishes
16 Healthy Dinners Cooked In Parchment Paper
Cooking in parchment paper packets, aka "en papillote", is a long-standing French technique. These recipes are perfect make-ahead dinners you can pop in the oven for a mess-free meal anytime (although you should cook fish recipes no more than one day after prepping, and chicken no more than two). Tin foil can be substituted for any of these recipes, but parchment is the classic choice. Foil sometimes reacts with the acid in foods (like marinades), which can make the food taste off.
