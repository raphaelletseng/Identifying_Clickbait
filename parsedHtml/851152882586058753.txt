Egypt's president has announced a three-month state of emergency after attacks on two Coptic churches that killed at least 45 people.

Abdul Fattah al-Sisi's measure will have to be approved by the parliament. He had earlier ordered the deployment of the military across the country.

So-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the blasts in Tanta and Alexandria.

In a statement, the group warned of more attacks.

They were the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Christian minority in Egypt, and appeared to have been timed for maximum impact as people gathered to mark Palm Sunday.

It is one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar, marking the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem.

The attacks come weeks before an expected visit by Pope Francis intended to show support for the country's Christian minority. He has condemned the explosions.
