Ephemeral New York
Ephemeral New York
The photographer Devin Yalkin says he wants people to hear his images, as if they have the ability to capture the low-fi, temporal hum of city life — here now, gone in an instant, leaving only a grainy black-and-white memory as evidence. Or put another way: Mr. Yalkin’s images represent the hum in his head as he vaporizes the scene in front of his camera. If you look for solid facts in these pictures, you are likely to come up empty. Summer beaches dress up like desolate frozen tundras; a leg disappears under a billowing coat; a set of teeth appears to break for freedom. Matter itself is immaterial. Whatever haunts the images is out of the frame, and what’s in the frame is too diffuse or evanescent to build on. A flash bulb pops, the world reveals itself for a second, and what is left is the impression of the image on its way to darkness. The images here are the residue that lingers. During the editing process, Mr. Yalkin, 35, said he discovered a “sort of dystopian language spoken between the photographs.” That language, he said, gave some permanence to moments that are by nature impermanent. “I’m trying to visually secure these ephemeral encounters moments before they disappear,” he wrote in an email. “For me this is what gives them their dreamlike aesthetic.” The porousness of the images makes room for viewers to enter and make their own interpretations. Is that blimp a protector or a threat? Is the man in the suit vertical or horizontal? Photographers often talk of making pictures, rather than taking them. In Mr. Yalkin’s “Acoustic Movements” series, the process also involves unmaking.
