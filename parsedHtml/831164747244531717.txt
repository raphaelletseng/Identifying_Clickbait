Neil Gaiman webchat – post your questions now

Post your questions for Neil Gaiman Neil Gaiman is a screenwriter, a showrunner, a comic book writer and a novelist, but above all a kind of old-fashioned storyteller. His tales of gods, dreamworlds and gothic horrorscapes have made him one of the world’s best-loved cult authors, even as he increasingly moves into the mainstream. After being hired by DC Comics in 1987, his Sandman series became enormously acclaimed over its seven-year span. He segued into novels like Stardust, Neverwhere, American Gods and Coraline, all of which have been adapted for film or TV; Gaiman is currently developing his Terry Pratchett collaboration Good Omens for the BBC. There’s still time for a new novel though, Norse Mythology, which retells the stories of gods like Loki and Thor. With the book out now, Gaiman joins us to answer your questions about it and anything else in his career, in a live webchat from noon GMT on Tuesday 14 February.
