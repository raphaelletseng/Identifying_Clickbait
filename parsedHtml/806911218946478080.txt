A woman has had death threats for appearing in public in Saudi Arabia without wearing an abaya or hijab.

Social media users were outraged, with one person writing: “Kill her and throw her corpse to the dogs”.

Translation of those tweets:

"We want blood".

"Kill her and throw her body to the dogs".

"The least punishment for her is beheading her". — Anon (@dontcarebut) November 29, 2016

An unnamed source told the International Business Times that the woman, reportedly named Malak al-Shehri, had announced she was going out for breakfast without a hijab or abaya. This is a punishable crime in Saudi Arabia.

She has apparently since deleted her account because of the backlash:

She deleted her account because of the threats she got. I hope that she is safe. — Anon (@dontcarebut) November 29, 2016

While you can't get away with showing your hair in Saudi Arabia, you can apparently get away with a pretty lenient sentence for murdering a child.

Fayhan al-Ghamdi, a Saudi preacher accused of raping, torturing and killing his five-year-old daughter was released from jail in 2013 after only serving a few months.

The girl, Lama, was beaten with an iron rod and wires, according to Gulf News, and passed away after being paralysed and comatose for eight months.

He was initially charged with manslaughter and sexual assault and sentenced to eight years in prison, but the charges were dropped when he agreed to pay "blood money" to Lama's mother.
