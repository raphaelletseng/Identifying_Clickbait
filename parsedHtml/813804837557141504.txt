Slip of surgeon's scalpel leads to boy losing tip of penis after botched circumcision
Slip of a surgeon's scalpel leads to boy losing the tip of his penis


A 10-year-old boy had the tip of his penis chopped off after a routine circumcision operation went horribly wrong.

The boy, who has not been named, was rushed to a hospital in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, after the catastrophe at a clinic in the suburb of Taman Cheras Utama.

It is not clear how the accident took place but it appears that the surgeon's laser scalpel might have slipped during the operation on December 20.

Malaysia's Star newspaper reported the boy's father, who was waiting patiently outside, was told the head of his son's penis had been severed.

The youngster was taken to Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Hospital and then onto another specialist hospital in the city where they successfully reattach the two parts.

But the furious father has filed a complaint with the police.

The Star newspaper did not name the surgeon who was responsible but said he had 21 years of experience and had a medical degree from Pakistan.

But the clinic, which had been operating for 15 years, had not been registered with Malaysia's Health Ministry.

Circumcision - the removal of the foreskin - is an expected rite of passage for boys in Malaysia, which is an overwhelmingly Muslim country.

Hundreds of thousands of such operations are carried out there every year.
