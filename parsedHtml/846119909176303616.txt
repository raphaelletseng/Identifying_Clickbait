‘Saying no is easy, leading is hard’: GOP congressman resigns from Freedom Caucus after health-care drama

If President Trump is going to put the blame for Republicans' inability to pass health-care legislation on the House Freedom Caucus, at least one member of the conservative coalition thinks it deserves it. Rep. Ted Poe (R-Tex.) resigned Sunday from the coalition of 35 to 40 conservative House lawmakers in protest over the group's opposition to the Republican health-care bill that tanked in Congress on Friday. “I have resigned from the House Freedom Caucus,” Poe said in a statement. “In order to deliver on the conservative agenda we have promised the American people for eight years, we must come together to find solutions to move this country forward. Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do. Leaving this caucus will allow me to be a more effective Member of Congress and advocate for the people of Texas. It is time to lead.” Poe's resignation comes hours after Trump tweeted that the Freedom Caucus, along with cash-flush conservative groups that share its hard-line ideological views, “have saved Planned Parenthood” and Obamacare by opposing the bill. Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2017   It's not clear whether Trump's statement had a direct effect on Poe's decision to leave the caucus. He was leaning toward voting for the bill, and he was openly critical of his conservative colleagues as the bill was being pulled from a vote.

Reid J. Ribble (R-Wis.) resigned after the Freedom Caucus played a role in forcing then-Rep. John A.
