Fox instantly regrets attempting to pounce on vole hiding in snow
LONDON — Hunting for small creatures must be a tall order at the best of times. But it becomes vastly more complex when they're concealed beneath a huge blanket of snow. Foxes that stalk the prairies in North America during wintertime know this only too well. During a segment of the trials of one particular fox — who was trying really, really hard to hunt a vole — captured the nation's heart.

"The survival of both creatures depends on getting through to the ground." And while the bison bludgeon through using their super-strong necks, the fox has a different (and not always entirely successful) approach: It looks painful but the little guy clearly has to commit 100% to every dive. Nope. Double nope. People clearly felt a sense of empathy for the fox.

Foxes that stalk the prairies in North America during wintertime know this only too well. During a segment of Planet Earth II the trials of one particular fox — who was trying really, really hard to hunt a vole — captured the nation's heart.
