Early Thursday morning (Feb. 16),Â Liam Payne tweeted a picture with the Toronto rapper,Â captioning the photo "great to see a genius at work last night."Â While Liam fans may be hoping that Payne's post is a hint that the two have collaborated, their meet-up likely just happenedÂ because Drake was in London Feb. 15 as part of his Boy Meets World Tour. Nevertheless, the two are clearly buds now -- so there's still hope that Drake/Payne collab could happen in the future.
