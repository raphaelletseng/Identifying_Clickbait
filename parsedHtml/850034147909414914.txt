You can poke a hole in this jacket and itâll repair itself


If you're like me and spend a lot of time outdoors, your clothesÂ end upÂ bearing the brunt of your travels. During walks through the woods, jackets tend to get caught on treeÂ branches, leaving little holes all over your clothes. TheÂ new Nano Cure Tech clothing lineÂ from Imperial MotionÂ aims to change all of that with a jacket that actually repairsÂ itself. All you have to do is remove the object, rubÂ the fabric together for a few seconds, and watch as the hole completely disappears.Â While theÂ materialÂ isn't indestructible, it's a great option for anyone who frequently finds holes in their clothes.
