Noah Cyrus Finds Love at a Party With New Song 'Stay Together'  by   FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS  Noah Cyrus sounds like the life of the party in her new song "Stay Together," which was released Friday (April 14).Â The 17-year-old pop star-on-the-rise opens the track boasting some sloppy behavior over minimal piano accompaniment, recalling drinking, laughing at jokes she doesn't get, yelling at the DJ, breaking her phone on the sidewalk and generally, as she puts it, "Doing things that I will not regret until the morning." Soon the chorus comes in and gets to the song's chore, where Cyrus is celebrating what may just be a one-night-stand or the makings of something more. She sings in a cadence begging to be sung along to, "Nothing lasts forever/ But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?"  "Stay Together" is the second single off Cyrus' debut album , following "Make Me (Cry)." It was produced by Digital Farm Animals, co-produced by Hudson Mohawke and co-written by Cyrus and Emily Warren, among others.Â Listen here:  FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS
