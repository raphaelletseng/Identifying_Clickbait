Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott was seen on video pulling down a woman's shirt to expose her bare breast during a party at a bar for Dallas' St. Patrick's Day parade, according to TMZ.

The report states a representative for the running back said "it was all in good fun" and that the woman wasn't mad at Elliott. The rep said the woman continued to hang out with Elliott and his friends after the parade ended. Even if that's true, however, it's worrisome Elliott decided to expose a woman without her clear consent.

Elliott, 21, is currently being investigated by the NFL for a reported domestic violence incident in July. Elliott was not arrested or charged by police in that matter.
