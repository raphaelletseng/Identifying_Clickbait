Comical foreign signs that got VERY lost in translation
Comical foreign signs that are VERY lost in translation


It's always helpful when authorities in foreign countries bother to translate their signs.

Unless they get it wrong, of course.

In some of the cases showcased here, spotted in countries including France and China, mistranslated instructions inadvertently go from useful to downright hilarious.

One sign, for example, gives directions to a 'garden with curled poo', while another seems to be advertising 'a nice electric shock'.

Others prove themselves to be real head-scratchers, as with the case of the sign that reads: 'Visitors are strictly not allowed to roll the granite balls in the lions' mouths.'

Here, MailOnline Travel has rounded up a collection of amusing and confusing foreign signs, so can you work out what they really mean?

Of course, if there do happen to be dogs roaming this garden, perhaps the accuracy is bang on

We're fairly sure no place in the world exists where humans are required to present octopuses, but anything is possible

If you really have to partake in an electric shock, at least make it a 'nice one', this sign advises

There's certainly something catchy about the sound of a 'palace of explosive loin', but appetizing, not so much

Banning the act of rolling granite balls into the mouths of lions probably wasn't what was meant here. That, or there are some very strange foreign customs we're not aware of

It's always a relief when your menu has translations in a foreign country, but a little less so in this case

We'll just have to take their word for it on this one, or opt instead for the 'mermaid in deep sea' dish that comes after it

So which is it? One translation for this 'romantic' Japanese sentence is 'let us never be apart', but another computer-generated translation spat out 'we're having sex with squid now'

Where in the world it is customary to stampede on a loo seat remains a mystery. More likely it's just another case of lost in translation

It's rather hard to drag your mind out of the gutter when it comes to this one, try as you might

Another one to get the schoolboys tittering, spotted here as some sort of safety warning

This isn't strictly wrong, but just goes to show that even direct translations can sometimes sound inadvertently funny

Whoever translated this menu had rather a loose grasp on the English language, but certainly earns points for effort

At last, an establishment in which you aren't charged extra for loo roll - so you'd better cherish it

Just in case you were considering it, you'd better find a more legal area in which to reach the end of your life around here

Teasing the animals in this enclosure seems to be a given, just make sure you don't hurt them

While the labelling of this fire extinguisher is obviously wrong, its spout does indeed bear resemblance to a grenade

A bit of a signage oxymoron here, although it doesn't take too much effort to work out what was really meant

This is just a culinary disaster waiting to happen, spotted on the back of a packet in France

Not the most appealing dish to sit right at the top of the chef's suggestions, but it's unlikely that this recipe really contains any ear-related ingredients

Another case of a jumbled translation, which proves to be far more amusing than it is useful

When it comes to falling into a lake, the best approach to take is a careful one, according to this sign

It might not make a whole lot of sense, but there is something undeniably adorable about this

Apparently, religion and DVD players do not mix well, and should be kept separate at all times
