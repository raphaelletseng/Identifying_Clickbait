The first great rap beef of the year was born Saturday and, as expected, the internet is totally freaking out. In case you missed it, Remy Ma dropped a scathing diss track called “shETHER” aimed squarely at Nicki Minaj.

Though the feud between the two rappers had been simmering for a while, Remy Ma’s haymaker should escalate things to a whole new level.

For seven blistering minutes, Remy Ma fired shot after shot, accusing Minaj of using a ghostwriter, snorting cocaine, and sleeping with Trey Songz. She even accused Minaj of having a surgically enhanced posterior, rapping: “I don’t think y’all understand how bad her ass got/The implants that she had put in her ass popped/I was like damn 90 days and you couldn’t have box/Did she at least compensate by giving you mad top?/Her name Minaj, right? She ain’t throw you some mad thots?”

While there’s no question that Nicki Minaj is currently owning the rap game on a totally different level than Remy, fire bars are fire bars, and according to the internet, Remy Ma’s bars were straight fire. Your move, Nicki.
