Crude Oilman: Running for Texas governor in 1990, Clayton Williams famously refused to shake hands with opponent Ann Richards.  (AP Photo/Pat Sullivan) Clayton Williams Energy agreed Monday to a buyout offer from Noble Energy, for $3.2 billion ($2 billion in stock, $700 million cash, $500 million assumed debt). What Noble gets for that is 120,000 acres in the coveted southern Delaware region of the Permian basin in west Texas, which should give them enough running room for 4,200 drilling locations. The companies figure there’s about 2 billion barrels of oil to be had there. The deal marks a huge payday for Clayton Williams Jr. in cash and stock. What an incredible turnaround. Less than a year ago, as oil prices dove to $26 a barrel , it looked increasingly as if Claytie’s run would end in bankruptcy. Clayton Williams shares fell from a peak of $141 in 2014 to $6.35 in March 2016. They will open Tuesday at $103.98 — a 15-fold increase in just 10 months. How’d that happen? The industry finally caught up to "Claytie." Williams, born in Midland, followed his father into the west Texas oil fields in 1957. He drilled his first successful well in 1959, then went on to build a big enough fortune in real estate, banking and telecom that by 1984 he got a slot on the Forbes 400.  Amid the outcry , his double-digit lead over Ann Richards disappeared, and Williams went back to the oilfields . He held the IPO for his company in 1993 and spent the years drilling throughout Texas. Life got pretty slow until oil prices spiked in 2007/2008, which sent Williams on the hunt again. Clayton Williams Energy acquired most of what it's selling to Noble from Chesapeake Energy in 2011 — far ahead of the pack. In the past year Parsley Energy and its billionaire CEO Bryan Sheffield has done more than $1 billion in Delaware acquisitions, with much of Parsley’s funding coming by issuing new equity at the bottom of the cycle. Apache Corp also unveiled its find in the Delaware, a field it calls Alpine High. As drillers kept bringing in prolific Delaware wells drilled into a zone known as the Wolfcamp it became clear that Clayton Williams Energy was in play. Last October CWEI cleaned itself up by selling off its East Central Texas assets for $400 million. At that time the company also hired on a new chief operating officer, previously the head of Delaware basin assets for Noble Energy. To help pay off CWEI’s $500 million in debt, Rezvan expects Noble to continue selling down its interests in the Tamar and Leviathan megafields that it discovered offshore Israel. Tamar field now flows enough natural gas to generate more than half of Israel’s energy, and Noble has already sold a 3.5% interest in Tamar for $430 million, and needs to part with another 7% stake in order to get down to the 25% equity interest required by Israel. Noble slashed its capital spending from $3 billion in 2015 to $1.9 billion last year as net income crashed from $210 million to a $416 million loss. Rezvan sees profits returning in 2018 with EPS that year of 51 cents. Noble shares closed on Friday at $37.39.

Clayton Williams Energy agreed Monday to a buyout offer from Noble Energy, for $3.2 billion ($2 billion in stock, $700 million cash, $500 million assumed debt). What Noble gets for that is 120,000 acres in the coveted southern Delaware region of the Permian basin in west Texas, which should give them enough running room for 4,200 drilling locations. The companies figure there’s about 2 billion barrels of oil to be had there.

The deal marks a huge payday for Clayton Williams Jr. The 84-year-old and his family own 50.5% of CWEI shares and will glean about $1.35 billion (pretax) in cash and stock. What an incredible turnaround. Less than a year ago, as oil prices dove to $26 a barrel, it looked increasingly as if Claytie’s run would end in bankruptcy. Clayton Williams shares fell from a peak of $141 in 2014 to $6.35 in March 2016. They will open Tuesday at $103.98 — a 15-fold increase in just 10 months.

How’d that happen? The industry finally caught up to "Claytie." Williams, born in Midland, followed his father into the west Texas oil fields in 1957. He drilled his first successful well in 1959, then went on to build a big enough fortune in real estate, banking and telecom that by 1984 he got a slot on the Forbes 400. In 1990 Williams looked a shoe-in to become the next governor of Texas, then he made a bad joke equating bad weather to rape: “If it’s inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.” Amid the outcry, his double-digit lead over Ann Richards disappeared, and Williams went back to the oilfields. He held the IPO for his company in 1993 and spent the years drilling throughout Texas. Life got pretty slow until oil prices spiked in 2007/2008, which sent Williams on the hunt again.

Clayton Williams Energy acquired most of what it's selling to Noble from Chesapeake Energy in 2011 — far ahead of the pack. In the past year Parsley Energy and its billionaire CEO Bryan Sheffield has done more than $1 billion in Delaware acquisitions, with much of Parsley’s funding coming by issuing new equity at the bottom of the cycle. Apache Corp also unveiled its find in the Delaware, a field it calls Alpine High.

Last October CWEI cleaned itself up by selling off its East Central Texas assets for $400 million. At that time the company also hired on a new chief operating officer, previously the head of Delaware basin assets for Noble Energy.

Analyst Tim Rezvan of Mizuho Securities likes the deal (even at $36,500 an acre) because it puts to bed “the perceived lack of scale in the Delaware Basin that has been an overhang on NBL shares.” Noble will spend about $500 million this year drilling in the Delaware — with the objective of growing output from the region from about 24,000 bpd (pro forma of the deal) today to 150,000 bpd in 2020. Noble CEO David Stover is determined to grow in the Delaware. Just last week it announced a separate $300 million acquisition there.

To help pay off CWEI’s $500 million in debt, Rezvan expects Noble to continue selling down its interests in the Tamar and Leviathan megafields that it discovered offshore Israel. Tamar field now flows enough natural gas to generate more than half of Israel’s energy, and Noble has already sold a 3.5% interest in Tamar for $430 million, and needs to part with another 7% stake in order to get down to the 25% equity interest required by Israel.

Noble slashed its capital spending from $3 billion in 2015 to $1.9 billion last year as net income crashed from $210 million to a $416 million loss. Rezvan sees profits returning in 2018 with EPS that year of 51 cents. Noble shares closed on Friday at $37.39.
