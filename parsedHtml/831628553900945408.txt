The person who filmed the clip believe the lights are connected to one structure.

UFO Today wrote online: 'One of my contacts in France send me over this video. This was shot today by a friend of him who lives in Edinburgh. He claims the footage is real and a lot of people saw it.

'The object hoovered above the village for a couple of minutes untill it simply vansihed. the cellphone of his friend just died out minutes before the object disappeared (sic).'

However, many people are sceptical and have suggested the source is in fact fires on a mountainside in the background that is shrouded in cloud.

According to UFO Today: 'The object hoovered above the village for a couple of minutes untill it simply vansihed (sic)'

'I believe there a mountain in the background and those are fires,' one viewer commented, 'Try using your head people.'

'Fires on a hillside, obscured by mist/fog/haze,' another agreed.

A third pointed out: 'It's always the phone or camera battery died in these vids. Does everyone always walk around w camera or phone thats about to die? (sic).'
