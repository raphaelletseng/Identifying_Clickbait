The biggest price that celebrities have to pay in exchange for fame and money is their privacy.

With paparazzi stepping in, private life is no longer private and everyone wants to know and consume the personal information related to a celebrity's life. From their dressing style to their weight, everything is always under the scanner by the media.

In a recent interview, actress Shilpa Shetty, spoke about fat-shaming of new mothers and how an actress is always under a constant radar for those extra calories, post-pregnancy.

"'Nach Baliye' was my first outing after pregnancy, eight months after I delivered. I was very scared. Clothes weren't fitting me, I was size 16, double the size I've ever been in my life. When you're working, that gives you enough inspiration or goal. Some do it for their loved one, some for work, I think you've to do it for yourself."
