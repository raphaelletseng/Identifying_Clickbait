Million Women Rise: thousands march through central London

Press Association    Thousands of women marched through central London on Saturday to call for an end to violence against women and girls, days after International Women’s Day. Gathering for the 10th annual Million Women Rise march, the protesters marched through Oxford Circus chanting: “Whatever I wear, wherever I go, yes means yes and no means no”. On their way to Trafalgar Square, those taking part, including campaigners against female genital mutilation (FGM), called for safe streets and “no excuse for violent men”. #MillionWomenRise March in Trafalgar Square, London are saying #NOMORE to violence against women and girls! pic.twitter.com/L7rKjFOI4g The march’s founder, Sabrina Qureshi, praised the “electric” event. She said the march was necessary to change society, particularly as the movement was “really underfunded”. The 44-year-old counsellor said: “A lot of us have worked in domestic violence and sexual violence. It got to a point where I was getting paid to give a woman space, but that space afterwards - her healing - wasn’t being supported by society or the government, because male violence is so normalised. “So we had to do something more, not just the therapy. We have to change society, hearts and minds. Feminism is overly important.

It wan’t really known and we felt that we had to make a critical mass. “We’ve got women here that represent all walks of life, from all over England, from Bolivia, from Eritrea. We’ve got variety. I believe that in our creativity and our self-organising, we will end domestic violence.” Ann Samuel, a student from London who attended the march said: “It’s about awareness and women raising their voices and making themselves heard. “I think more needs to be done against domestic abuse, domestic violence for women. They say when one woman stands up, they stand up for all women. “Services are being cut and we can’t let that happen. It affects everyone one way or another so being here makes a difference.” The march was formed in 2007 to campaign against the “global pandemic” of male violence against women.
