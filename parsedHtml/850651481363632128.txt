For Nathan‚Äôs birthday, nine of his friends planned a trip to Majorca. But unfortunately one of them, Joe McGrath, bailed.

Instead of having to look at one empty seat all week, the group of friends decided to take matters into their own hands, and find a new Joe McGrath to take with them.

One of the group messaged some Joe McGraths on Facebook.

McGrath wrote on Facebook that he doubted the legitimacy of the offer at first.

It looks like he had a great time:

Here's McGrath, the new one, talking about the holiday:

Oh yeah, and happy birthday, Nathan. Hope your thunder wasn't stolen too much.

And original Joe, well, you missed out.
