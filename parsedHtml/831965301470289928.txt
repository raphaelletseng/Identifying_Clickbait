Ashton Kutcher blew a kiss at John McCain and lol what is happening?
What the world needs now is love, sweet love — and if we need to rely on John McCain and Ashton Kutcher to help us achieve that, then so be it. On Wednesday morning, Kutcher, dreamy actor and chairman of Thorn , a tech company that builds software to fight human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children, attended a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in D.C. to speak about how to end modern slavery. After Kutcher's speech concluded, however, the world was given a quick glimpse at an, um, unexpected moment between him and Sen. John McCain. It started with sass and ended with a kiss ... SEE ALSO: Ashton Kutcher taught Poshmark that second-hand high-end shopping is cutthroat Alongside Elisa Massimino, president and CEO of Human Rights First — a leading human rights advocacy organization — Kutcher explained, "I’m here today to defend the right to pursue happiness." The father of two emotionally touched upon his trafficking work and shared heartbreaking anecdotes from his years working with authorities to combat these serious issues. After Kutcher's passionate 15-minute speech came to a close, Massimino shared her thoughts on the issues at hand. But before the hearing concluded, McCain made his way to the podium to offer the two his final words of gratitude ... and poke a little fun at Kutcher. "I also want to thank Elisa and Ashton," McCain began. "And Ashton," he went on, "you were better looking in the movies. Anyway ..." he said trailing off. Woah, woah, woah, what's with the sass, McCain? Are you trying to diss Kutch? Is a Senate hearing discussion of sexual exploitation the best time to bring up the actor's looks? IDK, man. As the room erupted with laughter, the camera cut to a smiling Kutcher who took the remark in stride and chose to respond by simply blowing McCain a kiss.

After Kutcher's speech concluded, however, the world was given a quick glimpse at an, um, unexpected moment between him and Sen. John McCain.

It started with sass and ended with a kiss ...

Alongside Elisa Massimino, president and CEO of Human Rights First — a leading human rights advocacy organization — Kutcher explained, "I’m here today to defend the right to pursue happiness."

The father of two emotionally touched upon his trafficking work and shared heartbreaking anecdotes from his years working with authorities to combat these serious issues.
