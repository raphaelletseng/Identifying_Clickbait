Twitter users are lambasting President-elect Donald Trump after he made an egregious typo in a tweet about China’s navy seizing a U.S. drone in the South China Sea.

“China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters – rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act,” wrote Trump in the now-deleted Tweet. He was referring to the recent controversy surrounding a Chinese Navy warship's decision to seize an underwater drone belonging to the U.S. Navy, which U.S. officials say “was lawfully conducting a military survey.”

In trying to weigh in on the issue on Twitter, Trump made a noteworthy error. Of course, he meant to write the word “unprecedented,” and after deleting the erroneous tweet, he posted a corrected version.

But Twitter users never miss a beat, and the social network is now abuzz with jokes making fun of the President-elect’s very silly, avoidable mistake.

Merriam-Webster’s Twitter account, known for its iconic clap backs and brutal owns, led the charge by using their “Word of the Day” to give Trump an English lesson.

Some surmised that the mistake may have been a "Freudian slip," and joked about the significance of the word slip.

It took Trump and his team 87 minutes to fix the word "unpresidented." pic.twitter.com/Bz7NxSqwlo — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) December 17, 2016
