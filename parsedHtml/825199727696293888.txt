20 Hit Songs That Literally Sound Exactly The Same
Britney Spears, “ Unusual You ” & Charli XCX, “ Break The Rules “ Britney’s 2008 number “Unusual You” and Charli’s 2014 anti-authoritarian hit “Break The Rules” both feature what is essentially the same synth-laden backing track. Nelly Furtado, “ Say It Right ” & Carly Rae Jepsen, “ Fever “ Early moments of beep-like percussion in both “Do It Right” (2006) and “Fever” (2016) lend a similar sound to the two songs released ten years apart from one another. Adele, “ I Miss You ” & Drake feat. Rihanna, “ Too Good “ It’s all in the intro for these two: Be it brief, “I Miss You” (2015) and “Too Good” (2016) have just about the same opening. G.R.L., “ Ugly Heart ” & Little Mix, “ Shout Out To My Ex “ The strummy, upbeat guitar work and swelling chorus of 2014’s “Ugly Heart” is virtually recreated by Little Mix in their 2016 single, “Shout Out To My Ex.” Sia, “ Cheap Thrills ” & The Chainsmokers feat. Daya, “ Don’t Let Me Down “ The introductory beats of “Cheap Thrills” (2016) and “Don’t Let Me Down” (2016) are almost identical, albeit paced in slightly differentiated manners. Beenie Man feat. Fambo, “ I’m Okay/Drinking Rum & Redbull ” & MØ, “ Drum “ The choruses of Beenie Man’s 2010 single “I’m Okay/Drinking Rum & Redbull” and MØ’s “Drum” (2016) feature rather comparable melodies. Fifth Harmony feat. Ty Dolla $ign, “ Work From Home ” & Cashmere Cat feat. Selena Gomez and Tory Lanez, “ Trust Nobody “ Though Cashmere Cat’s comes at a notably slower pace, “Work From Home” (2016) and “Trust Nobody” (2016) feature a similar cadence, made most obvious in the opening seconds of both songs. Kiiara, “ Gold ” & Terror Jr, “ Super Powers “ The use of that bass heavy, ticking-clock sound you hear reverberate throughout both 2015’s “Gold” and 2016’s “Super Powers” feels justified when you realize both songs have the same producers . Tori Kelly, “ Should’ve Been Us ” & Daya, “ Talk “ The opening percussion of Daya’s “Talk” (2016) is reminiscent of the bass-y drums featured in the earliest moments of Tori Kelly’s 2015 single “Should’ve Been Us.” Jai Wolf, “ Indian Summer ” & Carly Rae Jepsen, “ Store “ The last minute of Jai Wolf’s 2015 track and approximately the last 30 seconds of Carly Rae’s 2016 B-side include similar chime-like melodies.
