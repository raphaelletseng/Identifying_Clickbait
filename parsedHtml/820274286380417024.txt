Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney Jr. said Raiders owner Mark Davis is "getting close" to making a decision, per Bonsignore . A source close to Adelson said a partnership with the Raiders is "moving forward after some stumbles," per Cole . " NFL The league's study included a survey that attempted to quantify, on a host of categories, the overall strengths or weaknesses of Oakland and Vegas in comparison to other existing league markets. On the scale provided to owners, sources said, the average NFL market was given an overall rating 68; Oakland, a far superior TV market, scored a 70 according to those figures, while Vegas was just a 60 on this scale. Regardless, [Mark] Davis again told the full ownership present that he will file relocation papers as soon as possible in January, the sources said, and team president Marc Badain was critical of the league's study during the session about the potential move. "Badain basically stood up and said the league's study was BS," one source said. "And he had two of his studies that looked nothing like the one Grubman presented." ... Grubman said the following regarding the proposals from Oakland and Las Vegas, per Eric D. Williams of ESPN.com: I don't see Oakland as competing with Las Vegas. It's simply a question of whether they can put a proposal together that is viable for a team. They already have a team. If they don't put a proposal together, then what they would be expecting is for owners to vote down Las Vegas on the Las Vegas demerits, not Oakland's merits. And that's a different dynamic than if Oakland has a viable proposal on the table. ABC7 reported that Alameda County voted 3-1 in favor of the Oakland, California, stadium proposal. City and county officials approved the opening of negotiations with a group of investors headed by Ronnie Lott for a possible $1.3 billion stadium, according to Janie Har of the Associated Press. Grubman said the term sheet facing a vote is a "carbon copy" of old attempts to put a stadium in Oakland, per Tom Pelissero of . Pelissero added Davis did not attend the Dec. 12 meeting with investors. Rapoport reported Monday that NFL officials and members of the Raiders were meeting with Lott's group to discuss its proposal to keep the Raiders in Oakland. David DeBolt of the Bay Area News Group reported Dec. 9 that a new stadium and mixed-use development site was put forward in a design to keep the team in Oakland. Cole spoke to multiple NFL owners who believe Oakland officials "are playing political games" based on the state of talks. Cole  added the league believes officials "have no strong desire" to keep the Raiders in town, based on the fact the league approached the city and county twice about buying or leasing the Oakland Coliseum property to act as a developer for the team. Cole  noted that would make it easier for the team to stay, but the city and county have never responded to the request to get an idea of what it would cost. Raiders NFL While Mark Davis is unrelenting about wanting to move the team to Las Vegas, sources said he will face opposition to do so. ... Several ownership sources indicated they expect the NFL to do what it can to can to slow play any move to Vegas, while Davis is intent on filing relocation papers and bringing the matter to a vote as soon as possible. The NFL has a way of being quite persuasive and also has leverage in this situation given that it can control how steep of a relocation fee Davis would have to pay, as well as whether he qualifies for vital G4 stadium funding money (through the league office at a low interest rate); that program is devised primarily for teams looking for assistance finding ways to improve or replace their existing facilities in their current market. "I know that there is a lot of interest in what is going to happen with the Raiders and whether Oakland can keep its team from being ripped away from Bay Area fans for a second time," said  Pelissero : If Oakland is going to be successful in offering the Raiders and the NFL a viable alternative to moving to Las Vegas, I have to stay clearheaded. I cannot afford for us to be thrown off our game because Nevada lawmakers have deemed appropriate to put $750M in public money towards a private sports facility. While I'm committed to keeping the Raiders, I will not enter into a bidding war with Nevada using public funds. That's why I remain focused on working out concrete deal terms that give the NFL's owners an Oakland option to consider. I believe that in partnership with Alameda County and the team Ronnie Lott has assembled, we can offer a serious plan in the coming weeks that is fair to the Raiders, the league, the fans and the Oakland taxpayers to whom I am most responsible. Davis said he will not speak with Oakland and made a commitment to the Nevada governor, per Pelissero "Oakland was in the driver's seat, if they'd come up with anything. They came up with nothing. Zero," Davis said, per Breer . New York Giants owner John Mara said a decision regarding the Raiders' possible move to Las Vegas could be decided in January, noting the process has a long way to go, per Daniel Kaplan of the SportsBusiness Journal.

Adelson Family Announces It Won't Help Fund Proposed Vegas Stadium

Thursday, Feb. 2

Las Vegas Sands Corp. Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson has pulled out as a possible investor for a proposed 65,000-seat, $1.9 billion dome in Las Vegas, Richard N. Velotta of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Monday.

Shortly after the report, Adelson said in a statement that his family "will no longer be involved in any facet of the stadium discussion."

Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak said the move was "not a wrench in the wheel, the wheel fell off," per Riley Snyder of the Nevada Independent.

On Tuesday, a person close to Adelson said the prospect of salvaging a relationship with the team is "unlikely" and "beyond complicated," per Nathan Fenno of the Los Angeles Times.

In the wake of Adelson's decision, Jason Cole of Bleacher Report reported Tuesday that the lease proposal was "insulting" and not run by Adelson:

Details Emerge from Winter Meetings

Sunday, Dec. 18

"Grubman, the NFL's point person on stadium issues, presented data from a detailed market study indicating that Oakland is a far superior market to Vegas, according to league sources, while Raiders' execs pointed to two of their own studies that sought to discount that data and highlight the strength of Las Vegas," reported CBSSports.com's Jason La Canfora, who provided more insight:

The league's study included a survey that attempted to quantify, on a host of categories, the overall strengths or weaknesses of Oakland and Vegas in comparison to other existing league markets. On the scale provided to owners, sources said, the average NFL market was given an overall rating 68; Oakland, a far superior TV market, scored a 70 according to those figures, while Vegas was just a 60 on this scale. Regardless, [Mark] Davis again told the full ownership present that he will file relocation papers as soon as possible in January, the sources said, and team president Marc Badain was critical of the league's study during the session about the potential move.

"Basically, Mark was just pretty much saying, 'We're going, we're going, we're going,'" according to another source present at the meetings.

I don't see Oakland as competing with Las Vegas. It's simply a question of whether they can put a proposal together that is viable for a team. They already have a team. If they don't put a proposal together, then what they would be expecting is for owners to vote down Las Vegas on the Las Vegas demerits, not Oakland's merits. And that's a different dynamic than if Oakland has a viable proposal on the table.

Latest on New Proposal Vote

Oakland Unveils Stadium Plan to Keep Raiders in Bay Area

Tuesday, Dec. 13

Grubman said the term sheet facing a vote is a "carbon copy" of old attempts to put a stadium in Oakland, per Tom Pelissero of USA Today. Pelissero added Davis did not attend the Dec. 12 meeting with investors.

Rapoport reported Monday that NFL officials and members of the Raiders were meeting with Lott's group to discuss its proposal to keep the Raiders in Oakland.

David DeBolt of the Bay Area News Group reported Dec. 9 that a new stadium and mixed-use development site was put forward in a design to keep the team in Oakland.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf commented on the proposal, per DeBolt:

This term sheet agreement puts Oakland in the running to keep the Raiders in a way that is responsible to the team, the league, the fans and the taxpayers. Everything the city and county and the investor team is doing is about putting forward the best offer to encourage the Raiders ownership and the NFL to keep the Raiders in Oakland, where the team belongs.

However, Josh Dubow of the Associated Press (via the Edwardsville Intelligencer) noted that Davis is still "committed to moving to Las Vegas."

NFL Owners Reportedly Question Oakland's Desire to Keep Raiders

Thursday, Dec. 8

Cole spoke to multiple NFL owners who believe Oakland officials "are playing political games" based on the state of talks. Cole added the league believes officials "have no strong desire" to keep the Raiders in town, based on the fact the league approached the city and county twice about buying or leasing the Oakland Coliseum property to act as a developer for the team.

Cole noted that would make it easier for the team to stay, but the city and county have never responded to the request to get an idea of what it would cost.

NFL to Contest Raiders Move?

Sunday, Dec. 4

"The league office continues to maintain strong support for keeping the Raiders in Oakland and will extol the merits of that market at an upcoming NFL meeting in Dallas, leagues sources said," La Canfora reported. La Canfora continued:

While Mark Davis is unrelenting about wanting to move the team to Las Vegas, sources said he will face opposition to do so. ... Several ownership sources indicated they expect the NFL to do what it can to can to slow play any move to Vegas, while Davis is intent on filing relocation papers and bringing the matter to a vote as soon as possible. The NFL has a way of being quite persuasive and also has leverage in this situation given that it can control how steep of a relocation fee Davis would have to pay, as well as whether he qualifies for vital G4 stadium funding money (through the league office at a low interest rate); that program is devised primarily for teams looking for assistance finding ways to improve or replace their existing facilities in their current market.

Oakland Mayor Comments on Negotiations with Raiders

Wednesday, Oct. 19

"I know that there is a lot of interest in what is going to happen with the Raiders and whether Oakland can keep its team from being ripped away from Bay Area fans for a second time," said Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, per Pelissero:

If Oakland is going to be successful in offering the Raiders and the NFL a viable alternative to moving to Las Vegas, I have to stay clearheaded. I cannot afford for us to be thrown off our game because Nevada lawmakers have deemed appropriate to put $750M in public money towards a private sports facility. While I'm committed to keeping the Raiders, I will not enter into a bidding war with Nevada using public funds. That's why I remain focused on working out concrete deal terms that give the NFL's owners an Oakland option to consider. I believe that in partnership with Alameda County and the team Ronnie Lott has assembled, we can offer a serious plan in the coming weeks that is fair to the Raiders, the league, the fans and the Oakland taxpayers to whom I am most responsible.

Davis Comments on Pursuing Move to Las Vegas

Wednesday, Oct. 19

Davis said he will not speak with Oakland and made a commitment to the Nevada governor, per Pelissero.

"Oakland was in the driver's seat, if they'd come up with anything. They came up with nothing. Zero," Davis said, per Breer.

"It was really important to me that once that [Nevada deal] came through, that I live up to my commitment I made to [the governor]," Davis said, per Pelissero.

According to Pelissero, Davis would not address whether he felt he had support from the other owners.

Davis said he hopes to play a preseason game in Las Vegas in 2017, per Breer.

Raiders Looking to Take Young Core to New City

If Nevada does fund a stadium for the Raiders, the state will land a team with a bright future. The Raiders went 12-4 on the season, finishing second in the AFC West. What's more, the team's core consists of young playmakers entering their primes, like Derek Carr (25 years old), Amari Cooper (22 years old) and Khalil Mack (25 years old).

This wouldn't be the first time the Raiders moved in their history. The franchise played in Oakland from 1960 to 1981 (in the AFL from 1960 to 1969) before moving to Los Angeles. It played in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994 but has been in Oakland ever since.
