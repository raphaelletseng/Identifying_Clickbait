Rumoured Nokia D1C Android Phone To Be Priced At Rs 9999, More Specs Revealed

Earlier this month we reported how Nokia’s Android smartphones are slated for launch in early 2017. As we get closer to the impending launch of the new Nokia D1C Android smartphones, more leaks have confirmed specs and price of the two Android smartphones.

According to the Nokia Power User website, which claims to have access to brand new information from a source familiar with Nokia’s launch plans, the upcoming Nokia D1C Android smartphone is going to be launched in two variants -- a higher end premium version and a more affordable mainstream version. If you thought you’d have to sell a kidney to be able to afford the upcoming Nokia Android phones, you couldn’t be more wrong!

The website claims that the 2GB RAM variant of Nokia D1C will be priced at US $150 (Rs 9999 approximately) and the Nokia D1C phone with 3GB RAM will be priced around $200 (Rs 12,999 approximately). The website does advise users to take the price claim with a rather large pinch of salt, as the source of this information isn’t one of their regular sources.

What the website is fairly confident about is the Nokia D1C smartphone’s specs and features, which are as follows:

1.4 GHz Snapdragon 430 Processor

Adreno 505 GPU

2 / 3 GB RAM*

Android Nougat 7.0

5 / 5.5-inch, 1080p display*

16 GB internal storage

13 /16 MP Rear camera*

8 MP FFC

This pretty much sums it up. The two variants of the Nokia D1C Android smartphone will differ in terms of RAM (2GB vs 3GB), form factor (5-inch vs 5.5-inch 1080 screen size), and rear camera (13MP vs 16MP). Both Nokia D1C smartphone variants will run on 1.4 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, Adreno 505 GPU, Android Nougat 7.0 operating system, 16GB internal storage and 8MP front-facing camera.

Looking at the prices and specs, seems like the Nokia D1C Android smartphone is going to be a mainstream warrior, aiming to discuss the 10k to 15k Android smartphone segment.

Looking forward to it, should be fun!
