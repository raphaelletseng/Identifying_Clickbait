Top 300

Note: "Elig. Pos." is the player's eligible position(s) entering 2017. Position eligibility is determined based upon a minimum of 20 games, otherwise the position the player appeared at most, in 2016. "Pos. Rank" is the player's ranking at the position he played most in 2016. "2016 PR" is the player's final, overall finish on our Player Rater. An asterisk (*) next to a player's team indicates that he and/or his team possesses a 2017 option on his contract; if declined, the player would become a free agent ("FA").
