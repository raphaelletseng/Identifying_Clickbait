PGA golfer uses his bare hands to shoo 8-foot alligator off the course

Pro golfer Cody Gribble temporarily turned into an alligator whisperer on Thursday when he oh-so-casually chased one off the course with a tap to its tail. Don't try this at home. 😳🐊 pic.twitter.com/BUumzwPH21 — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) March 16, 2017 The whole thing happened on live television when the left-handed golfer noticed the gator on the sixth fairway at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill Course in Orlando. Instead of calling for help, as most people might do in that situation, Gribble, who notes on his Twitter bio that he’d “rather be hunting or fishing,” decided to take matters into his own hands. Literally, actually, as the 26-year-old used his left hand to nudge that gator into the water. “I wasn’t really afraid of it,” Gribble told reporters when asked about it after the round. Gribble estimated the gator was about eight feet long and noted that when it comes to his sponsors’ approval of the incident, “It’s probably frowned upon.” He maintained, however, that he knew what he was doing because, yes, he’s come in contact with alligators before while fishing. “Those, it’s like a jolt, it’s quick. You know they’re not gonna get ya,” he continued. “I’m not in its way, I’m right behind him … You know, it’s fun.” Gribble went on to compliment the alligator, calling it “beautiful” and noting it’s skin was “incredibly clean.” . @CodyGribble Full-time golfer.

He maintained his coolness about what happened online later, calling the feat “no biggie.” Gators need exercise too, no biggie guys. https://t.co/K97j4WHuVP — Cody Gribble (@CodyGribble) March 17, 2017 Meanwhile, all the rest of us could only breathe a sigh of relief knowing this situation didn’t result in a “Happy Gilmore” type of accident. (Never forget Chubbs Peterson!) @CodyGribble  @PGATOUR Did you learn nothing from Chubbs Peterson? He could have been the greatest. pic.twitter.com/fKxqfycXvD — Kevin Kohr (@kevin_kohr) March 17, 2017 Gribble said on Thursday part of the reason he approached the gator was to get his adrenaline up. Unfortunately for him, however, it didn’t seem to work. While Gribble’s animal-handling skills proved exemplary on Thursday, his golf game left much to be desired. At 6-over, Gribble found himself tied for 101st place, 12 strokes behind co-leaders Lucas Glover and Charley Hoffman.
