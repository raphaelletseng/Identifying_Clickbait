Samsung Galaxy S8 price leak suggests it will be much cheaper than Apple iPhone 8
The launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 is just over a week away, and alleged pricing details for the new phone have just emerged. The handset will be unveiled on 29 March and start shipping in late April and, according to figures revealed by Evan Blass, it will be a lot more affordable than the upcoming iPhone 8. In a Twitter post , the tech tipster claimed the S8 will cost €799, with the larger S8+ priced at €899. These line up with previous leaks from Roland Quandt, and aren’t far off the £799 and £899 figures recently quoted by MobileFun.

The S8 will almost certainly be one of the most expensive smartphones on the market when it arrives, but reports claim that the 10th anniversary iPhone will cost more than $1,000.

That's far more expensive than the iPhone 7, itself already the highest-priced handset that Apple has ever sold.

In a separate post, Evan Blass added that the S8 and S8+ will be available in “black sky”, “orchid grey” and “arctic silver” colour schemes.

The regular model will feature a 5.8-inch, 2,960 x 1,440 display, with the S8+ bumping the screen size up to 6.2-inches.

Image leaks show that Samsung has ditched the handset’s home button to keep it relatively compact, while numerous rumours have pointed towards the inclusion of Bixby, a new AI assistant said to be capable of recognising text and real-world objects through the Galaxy S8’s camera.

It’s also said to be capable of doubling up as an Android-running desktop computer through a dock called DeX, which will cost €150, according to Mr Blass.
