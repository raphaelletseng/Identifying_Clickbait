John Lewis is dominating Amazon's bestsellers list John Lewis, a computer science educator from Blacksburg, Virginia, may be the best example of this. Meet John Lewis, owner of the world's most confusing Twitter handle.

The handle in the middle is that of a large department store in the UK (you know, the one that makes those viral Christmas adverts every year). The man at the bottom, meanwhile, is our hapless hero. Because he joined Twitter way back in November 2007, John Lewis bagged himself the most straightforward Twitter handle of the three: @johnlewis. The problem? It means he constantly has to field requests like this: @waitrose  @johnlewis 2/2 you guys are to blame for the library closing down upstairs in the Podium. Can you confirm you're not the reason? — Caroline Ambrose (@caroambrose) January 12, 2017 I can categorically confirm that I am NOT the reason for the library closing upstairs in the Podium, whatever that is. @johnlewisretail  https://t.co/zLTETjdzdt — John Lewis (@johnlewis) January 12, 2017 John Lewis is pretty much famous in Britain for the way he handles the annual surge of tweets mis-directed at the UK department store whenever they release their Christmas ad. And since Congressman John Lewis made headlines last Wednesday when he spoke out about Trump's nominee for attorney general , the other John Lewis has been fielding even more misplaced tweets. Bows to @CoryBooker and @JohnLewis thank you for your fearlessness — Jana Fleming (@JtotheFlem) January 11, 2017 You should thank @repjohnlewis instead.

It's a good thing the government takes off around Christmas. — John Lewis (@johnlewis) January 12, 2017 Following Trump's Twitter rant about Congressman Lewis, though, John Lewis' Twitter feed took a depressing turn. Depressing day. 90% of misdirected tweets today were racist rants, which I did NOT redirect or reply to. — John Lewis (@johnlewis) January 16, 2017 Luckily, despite the many unpleasant voices on the internet, there were just as many people who made their support for both John Lewis' clear. I wish Trump was a civil rights hero, a patient man on Twitter, and had a two year warranty. @repjohnlewis  @johnlewis  @johnlewisretail — David Estall (@Mr_Estall) January 15, 2017 This almost made my Twitter experience today worth it.
