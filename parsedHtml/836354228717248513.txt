A poll released Sunday by and NBC News, which polled 1,000 Americans, finds 51% of Americans believe the media has been too critical of Trump, while 41% think news coverage has been fair and objective, and 6% say the media hasn't been tough enough.

Asked if they believe the news media is "exaggerating the problems with the Trump Administration because they are uncomfortable and threatened with the kind of change Trump represents," 89% of Republicans agreed.
