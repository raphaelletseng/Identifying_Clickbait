Four Years After Nirbhaya, Delhi Still Reports Six Rape Cases A Day, Even As Crime Rate Falls Even though registration of crimes against women dipped marginally in 2016, Delhi reported six rapes on an average every day, indicating that much more was needed to be done to bring the numbers further down. In 2017, the numbers have dipped further. Delhi Police registered 140 rape cases in January. Last year, the figure was 147 by January end. Delhi Police officers said that the dip in crime rates is the result of proactive policing measures.

According to police data, 96.4% of the accused in rape cases were known to the victims. Overall, Delhi Police registered 2,155 cases of rape in 2016 as against 2,199 registered in 2015.
