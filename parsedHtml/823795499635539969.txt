Map: The largest company in every state
Map: The largest company in every state


It’s one thing to look at a list of the most valuable companies in America, listed by their respective market capitalization. Unlike ranking companies by revenue, multiplying share price by total shares yields numbers representative of what a company is worth, up to date with what the market thinks.

Unfortunately, a list of the largest companies may not cover much of the country, since many large businesses are found in similar locations. But looking at a map of the most valuable companies in each state shows that everything isn’t just focused in New York and Silicon Valley.

Put together from Yahoo Finance data by Broadview, a cloud computing company, the map serves as a good reminder that there are massively valuable businesses in most states in the country. The map also lends a certain context of origin or home base for many globalized companies. When there seems to be a Walmart (WMT) in every corner of the world, it’s easy to forget it’s an Arkansas company.

Looking at last year’s map, there’s been a few changes. This year, Cloud Peak (CLD) has bumped out Johnson Controls (JCI) in Wisconsin, Dow (DOW) surpassed Ford (F) in Michigan, Kraft Heinz replaced McDonald’s (MCD) in Illinois, and Eastgroup (EGP) edged out Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) in Mississippi. South Dakota also is now repped by Black Hills Corporation (BKH) Resources, which replaced Northwestern Energy (NWE).

Conspicuously absent from the map are Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), two top-10 companies by market cap, which are eclipsed by Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) in Washington and California, respectively.

Check out the map and the full list of companies by each state below.
