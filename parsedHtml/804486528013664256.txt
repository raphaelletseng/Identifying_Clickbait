A week after being drafted by the New York Jets in 2010, he showed up for rookie minicamp and threw up during practice. It made for unflattering headlines, but McKnight overcame the rough start and became a dynamic kickoff returner for the Jets, especially in 2011 and 2012. He scored on a 107-yard return in 2011, the year he led the league in kickoff-return average. McKnight was far from perfect -- he fell out of favor with Rex Ryan's coaching staff -- but he was popular among teammates because of his sense of humor. Explaining his 16-pound weight gain at the start of offseason workouts in 2012, McKnight blamed his "McDonald's diet." There was a happy-go-lucky side to his personality. He was the kid in school who got yelled at by the teachers but somehow endeared himself to his fellow students. He was a gifted player, one of the nation's top high-school prospects before committing to USC, but he never fulfilled his immense potential. On Thursday, McKnight was fatally shot in an apparent road-rage incident in New Orleans, where he was a legendary high-school running back. There was an outpouring of shock and sympathy from former teammates and other NFL players. Rest In Peace to my bro Joe McKnight...this is unbelievable. Fly with the angels bro and rest in paradise.
