Someone Threw The 'Veep' Music Over That Awkward Trump Non-Signing, And It's Fantastic
Someone Threw The 'Veep' Music Over That Awkward Trump Non-Signing, And It's Fantastic
President Donald Trump had an awkward moment on Friday when he left his own big executive order-signing moment without, you know, signing the executive orders . While Trump tried to leave, the scene quickly took a turn for the chaotic. A reporter tried to ask Trump about one of his tweets from earlier in the day about his former national security adviser Michael Flynn . Vice President Mike Pence rushed over to the commander in chief before grabbing the unsigned executive orders and whisking them away. In a video, people can be heard confirming what they just saw. “So he didn’t sign them?” one man asks. ”He did not sign them,” a woman replies. “He did not sign them,” a third man confirms. It was a bewildering moment, one that gave BuzzFeed’s Brandon Wall an idea. “Could someone please mash this up to be in the style of a @VeepHBO closing credits scene? PLEASE,” he tweeted. Luckily for him, BuzzFeed’s Jesse McLaren was ready and willing to do just that. And ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you: The video he create is wonderful. TRUMP MOMENT as @VeepHBO closing credit scene is 🤣😂😂 (Based on @Walldo tweet) pic.twitter.com/aZpKydSbkn HBO’s “Veep” has made its comedic reputation on portraying Washington, D.C., insiders as a little more than a gaggle of bumbling incompetence ― something that they have said has become harder to parody with the rise of Trump . Nevertheless, the cast and crew of the show appeared to be more excited about the video than maybe anyone. Oh my god this is spot on. https://t.co/kQIseZbgDe @McJesse  @VeepHBO  @Walldo this is pretty great The crossing of the streams https://t.co/LQX5fOADLz ”Veep” star Julia Louis-Dreyfus and executive producer David Mandel retweeted the video as well.
