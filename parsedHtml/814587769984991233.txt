Cambodian police officer accused of faking being hit by politician's car

Posted

A member of Cambodia's Opposition party has been arrested for allegedly driving his car into a police officer, but footage of the incident has raised concerns the collision may have been faked.

On Christmas Eve, MP Mang Puthy went to try to resolve a dispute between a motorcyclist and police as part of his work as a union leader supporting motorcycle taxi drivers.

Police allege he ran over an immigration police officer, despite being signalled to stop.

But footage of the incident appears to show the policeman suddenly falling to the ground when the car was barely moving, prompting accusations he faked the incident.

In the video, Mr Puthy's car can be seen inching forward when the officer, Chhean Pisith, appears to step into its path and then dramatically fall to the ground.

Mr Pisith was taken from the scene on a stretcher, wearing a neck brace.

Video of the incident has been widely shared on social media and has spawned a number of parodies.

But the police are sticking with the story, rejecting claims the accident was faked to punish Mr Puthy for his union activities.

Mr Puthy remains in pre-trial detention, charged with intentional violence with aggravating circumstances.

The ruling party has absolute control over Cambodia's security forces and is thought to be worried about the growing popularity of the Opposition in the lead up to elections in 2018.
