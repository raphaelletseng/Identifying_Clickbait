Someone Has Made The Trump Sandwich A Reality And It Matches His Personality Perfectly!
Someone Has Made The Trump Sandwich A Reality And It Matches His Personality Perfectly!
Someone Has Made The Trump Sandwich A Reality And It Matches His Personality Perfectly! Don't know about you, but this Trump sandwich sounds like a complete winner. People hate the American President Donald Trump but they may just agree with this sandwich named after him, for it brings ingredients that compare to the man perfectly. This sign was found by a Twitterer, Dr. Debbie Almontaser, outside a New York City bodega which read: "Trump Sandwich. White bread. Full of baloney. With Russian dressing. And a small pickle." The bodegas, or grocery stores, in New York are generally owned by immigrants that are open round the clock selling groceries and food items such as bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. Full points to you if you can read between the lines and sense the tasteful use of metaphors in this one. *chuckles*
