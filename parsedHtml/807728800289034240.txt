AA Gill: 'Giant among journalists' British food critic and columnist dies at 62

Posted

Long-standing restaurant critic and columnist Adrian Gill, better known as AA Gill, has died aged 62 from cancer, Britain's Sunday Times said.

Gill revealed he had cancer in his regular column last month.

"I've got cancer," his opening words read. "Sorry to drop that onto the breakfast table apropos of nothing at all.

"There is barely a morsel of offal that is not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy.

"My insides are being turned into road-rail, pig-lead, firewood, iron-ware and cheap tin trays."

In an announcement on its website on Saturday (local time), the paper's editor Martin Ivens said "the suddenness of his death has shocked us all".

Ivens added Gill was "the heart and soul of the paper", and said "his wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless".

"Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."

The Edinburgh-born Gill is known for his writing on food, television, fashion and travel.

He is author of books including Table Talk, AA Gill is Away and a memoir, Pour Me: A Life.

In an earlier interview with the Sunday Times he said he had no regrets.

"I realise I don't have a bucket list; I don't feel I've been cheated of anything," Gill said.

"I gave up [alcohol] when I was still quite young, so it was like being offered the next life.

"It was the real Willy Wonka golden ticket â€” I got a really good deal."
