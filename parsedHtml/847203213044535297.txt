Uh, Spiders Could Eat All Of Us In A Year, Just In Case You Were Wondering
Admit it, you're feeling creepy crawly right now.                                  Which is why they are sometimes depicted with charming accoutrements like old-timey top hats.                                                                   That's a lot of prey! In fact, scientists Martin Nyffeler and Klaus Birkhofer found that spiders eat meat than humans.                                  Here's a stock model expressing existential dread about her dead corpse being eaten by a bunch of dang spiders.                                                                   OK, OK, you'd have to be dead. Like they couldn't eat you a live. But still.                                  So far, 786 people have signed it. You monsters.

How serious is the spider threat? Jury's still out. There's a Change.org petition directed at Senator Al Franken asking that he "Give Spiders All The Help They Need To Eat Every Human On Earth Within One Year."
