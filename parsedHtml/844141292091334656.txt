Why people are painting their faces green in Russia
Why people are painting their faces green in Russia
Alexei Navalny is an anti-corruption blogger who over the years became opposition leader and leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. As such, he's often exposed to intimidation from pro-Kremlin supporters. However, this time he didn't expect to be doused with a green antiseptic liquid. SEE ALSO: The Russian Embassy tweeted about U.S. relations and everyone is so lost The incident happened as Navalny was campaigning in the Siberian city of Barnaul. An unknown assailant walked up to him and pretended to shake his hand before flinging the liquid ‚Äî known in Russian as "zelyonka". Navalny wrote on Facebook that he feared it was an acid attack. To his relief, the antiseptic remains on skin for days but it's harmless. So the campaigner did what politicians do: turn the incident into an opportunity. ‚ÄúI will be opening a headquarters in Barnaul as if I am from the film ! Cool. Even my teeth are green!" he tweeted, in reference to the superhero film featuring Jim Carrey. –û—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å —à—Ç–∞–± –≤ –ë–∞—Ä–Ω–∞—É–ª–µ —è –±—É–¥—É –≤ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–µ –∏–∑ —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º–∞ "–ú–∞—Å–∫–∞". –ö–ª–∞—Å—Å–Ω–æ. –î–∞–∂–µ –∑—É–±—ã –∑–µ–ª–µ–Ω—ã–µ! pic.twitter.com/3puuPNCuwf ‚Äî Alexey Navalny (@navalny) March 20, 2017 In another tweet he wrote: "Avatar?
