Politics Live – readers' edition: Tuesday 11 April

Guardian readers          I’m not writing my usual blog this week but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition. It is a place for you to discuss today’s politics, and to share links to breaking news and to the most interesting stories and blogs on the web. Feel free to express your views robustly, but please treat others with respect and don’t resort to abuse. Guardian comment pages are supposed to be a haven from the Twitter/social media rant-orama, not an extension of it. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. And here are some of the main ones on our site this morning.    Politics   Politics live with Andrew Sparrow
