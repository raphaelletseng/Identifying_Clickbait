If you like piñatas and cakes, you'll love candy-filled smash cakes
You like piñatas. You like cakes. Now you can have them together in a Sydney creator's smash cakes, which are both edible and designed for those with an appetite for destruction. SEE ALSO: Prepare to blast off to the coolest galaxy cake ever Like a piñata, inside each of her smash cakes is an assortment of candy that'll spill out when you crack open the chocolate shell. You can get them on Claudia Abrahams' SydneySmashCakes , and videos of them getting wrecked on Instagram have been quite the hit — and fair enough. A post shared by SydneySmashCakes (@sydneysmashcakes) on Abrahams, originally a graphic designer, said she has been making the smash cakes for her kid's parties for years. Then she realised she could transition to making a living out of it. "I had been out of graphic design for a few years and had been focusing on my painting, artworks and exhibitions. In October 2015 I decided to try and turn SydneySmashCakes into a full time business," she said. Each cake takes between two to six hours to make depending on the design. Funnily enough, most of her cakes make for adults now, as opposed to children. With many of her cake designs consisting of a thin chocolate shell, the challenge is making sure they don't melt as she makes them. "The biggest challenge I face on a regular basis is the weather. If it’s too hot and/or humid, it's a nightmare to work with chocolate," she said. Fair enough. Now enjoy these cakes getting smashed up.
