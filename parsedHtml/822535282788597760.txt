Donald Trump inauguration: President returns Winston Churchill bust to Oval Office before dancing My Way at inaugural ball
onald J Trump has capped the day of his inauguration with dancing and celebrating, hours after being¬†sworn in as the 45th President of America with a vow¬†to rebuild the country using "American hands". "American carnage stops right here and right now," he said on the steps of the Capitol after taking the Oath of Office. He said he would strip power away from Washington and give it "back to the people". "We must think big and dream even bigger," he said. "America will start winning again, winning like never before. "We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams. "We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation." arack Obama, the former president and his wife Michelle, the former first lady, watched on as they handed power to the Trumps. uring Mr Trump's speech, the rain started falling in Washington. He and wife Melania had earlier had tea at the White House with the Obamas. Hillary and Bill Clinton were also there along with other former presidents, George W Bush and Jimmy Carter, and their first ladies. George H W Bush and his wife Barbara remain in hospital in Houston. t was the first time Mrs Clinton had come face-to-face with Mr Trump since her bruising election defeat to the Republican in November. Eager to demonstrate his readiness to take actions, Mr Trump went directly to the Oval Office Friday night, before the inaugural balls, and signed his first executive order as president - on "Obamacare." When I met Trump as President elect I asked him to return the Churchill bust to the Oval Office. First day: pic.twitter.com/zZ4TBppeuZ hief of Staff Reince Priebus said it was an order to federal departments "minimising the economic burden" of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. The new president also returned a bust of Sir Winston Churchill to the Oval Office - in a nod¬†to the "special relationship". "This is a movement and now the work begins," Mr Trump told supporters, before dancing with his wife, Melania, to "My Way" at the first of three inaugural balls. "We love you. We're going to be working for you and we're going to produce results."  Putin 'ready to meet' new US president rom the Reuters news agency: Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to meet U.S. President Donald Trump but preparations for the possible meeting may take months, not weeks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by TASS news agency. "This will not be in coming weeks, let's hope for the best - that the meeting will happen in the coming months," Peskov told BBC, according to TASS.

While some outlets ominously predicted the "chaos" starts now, others declared it was the start of a new world order. "This American carnage stops right here," Mr Trump declared in his address . In a warning to the world, he said: "From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it's going to be America first." ead here to see how the world's media reacted . Trump returns to White House he nation's 45th president, Donald Trump, has arrived back at the White House after attending three inaugural balls celebrating his election. The president has used the balls to recount his victory and to let supporters know that "now the fun begins." One of the biggest cheers of the night came when he asked whether he should continue to use his Twitter account. The crowd gave the question a resounding yes. THANK YOU for another wonderful evening in Washington, D.C. TOGETHER, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAINüá∫üá∏ pic.twitter.com/V3aoj9RUh4 he president took part in one dance at each ball after giving a short speech. The president chose to dance to the song "My Way" during the first two balls and "I Will Always Love You" for the third. View from Mexico erhaps no country was watching the inaugural address more closely than Mexico yesterday. Trump has made disparaging remarks about immigrants who come to the United States illegally and sought to pressure companies not to set up shop in Mexico by threatening a border tariff on goods manufactured there and exported to the United States. So Trump's talk of "protect(ing) our borders," "America first" and "buy American and hire American" had particular resonance in America's southern neighbor. Ricardo Anaya Cortes, president of the conservative opposition National Action Party, called for "the unity of all Mexicans, unity in the face of this protectionist, demagogic and protectionist speech we just heard. Unity against that useless wall, against deportations, against the blockade of investment." "The challenge is enormous. ... We demand the federal government leave aside tepidity, that it tackle with absolute firmness and dignity the new relationship with the United States," Anaya said. Felicito al Presidente @realDonaldTrump por su toma de posesi√≥n.Trabajaremos para fortalecer nuestra relaci√≥n con responsabilidad compartida he United States is by far Mexico's largest commercial partner, buying some 80 percent of its $532 billion in exports in 2015. Mexico is the second-largest market for U.S. exports. "At least the word 'Mexico' was not heard in the speech. Nevertheless one can expect the United States to launch a hyper-protectionist project," said Ilan Semo Groman, a researcher at Iberoamericana University. If Trump truly moves to block or drive away U.S. investment in Mexico, Semo said Mexico should focus its commercial efforts on other countries. "There are very clear possibilities," Semo said. "It's made in China!" arlier today¬†in his speech, one of the biggest cheers Mr Trump received from supporters was his call to "buy American and hire American." It was a moment rich in irony. Many of those supporters were sporting Trump's trademark red "Make America Great Again" baseball caps that were made in China, Vietnam and Bangladesh. A big cart of President Trump merchandise just rolled by. You'll never guess where the stuff was made... pic.twitter.com/gFERwOSNnn ome were horrified when they discovered their Trump hats were foreign made. Rob Walker, 44, who had driven to Washington from Georgia with his wife Abby, 36, had stopped at a truck stop on the way to buy a "Make America Great Again" cap. "Oh God, I hope it's not made in China," Abby said, flipping the cap over to check. She looked at its label. "China! Don't tell anyone!" The Trump hats available for purchase on Trump's official campaign website are made in the United States and cost between $25 and $30, according to the label inside those caps. But they are also more expensive than the $20 versions sold by street vendors in Washington on Friday.

The answer: Mrs. Trump wore an ivory gown by Herve Pierre to the evening's inaugural balls. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honour to dress the First Lady,‚Äù Pierre said in a statement to Women's Wear Daily . The French-born designer worked at Carolina Herrera for 14 years before leaving last February. ‚ÄúI was actually lucky because over my 20 years in the US, I dressed all the first ladies: Mrs. Clinton at Oscar [de la Renta], Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama at Carolina Herrera. So I feel lucky and honoured to dress Melania Trump, but this time under my name. "‚ÄúIt was an amazing experience!‚Äù he continued, noting that Trump‚Äôs contributions were technical as well as aesthetic. ‚ÄúShe knows what she likes. Our conversations were, and are, very easy. She knows about fashion, as a former model. She is aware about constructions, so we have already the same vocabulary when it comes to designing a dress.‚Äù And he does it his way...again Watch: The President and first lady dance at the Freedom Ball https://t.co/tyAVBpD9Vm Time for the second ball r Trump has arrived at the second official ball, the Freedom Ball.

Sir Michael Fallon promises the US will remain Britain's closest security partner efence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has promised that the United States will remain Britain's closest security partner after Donald Trump's inauguration as president. General James "Mad Dog" Mattis has now been confirmed by the Senate as Mr Trump's defence secretary and Sir Michael drew attention to his experience as a former Nato commander as he congratulated him on taking up his post. It comes after Mr Trump again raised concerns about his commitment to Nato at a time when Russia is showing increasing aggression. In his inauguration speech on Friday, the new president complained that the US had "subsidised the armies of other countries" and "defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own". Baltic nations, which fear Russian incursion as Vladimir Putin masses troops on their borders, will hope Mr Trump was simply urging other Nato members to boost their defence spending rather than signalling a desire to leave the alliance of mutual protection. ir Michael and Gen Mattis will be speaking at the earliest possible opportunity and have already exchanged welcome letters. They are both are due to attend a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels in February. Sir Michael said: "I congratulate James Mattis on his confirmation as US Defence Secretary. "With his experience as a former Nato commander, having also served alongside British forces, I look forward to working with him to build on our deep and enduring defence partnership. 'The US is and will remain our closest defence and security partner. "Secretary Mattis and I will be working hard to ensure that both our countries remain equipped and ready to play our part in confronting the threats we face and deterring aggression."

The fact that his theme hasn‚Äôt changed one bit suggests that there will be no transition from candidate to president. He will continue to stoke up, divide, inflame and generally cause mischief. If you hate Trump the candidate, you‚Äôll hate Trump the president. But a refusal to change also implies a degree of integrity. Donald Trump knows that he‚Äôs not in office to heal America and shower the land in a pixie dust mist of good feelings. He said he‚Äôs going to build a wall, kill all the terrorists and bring jobs back ‚Äì so that‚Äôs what he‚Äôll try to do. What a speech. My opinion on this may well be unique in Britain ‚Äì that‚Äôs not a first ‚Äì but I thought it was well-crafted, occasionally poetic, really rather good. Perhaps it‚Äôs shtick, maybe he‚Äôs faking, but Trump articulates powerfully a sense of outrage at the decline of Middle America. The heart of the speech was the section on what makes him angry: ‚ÄúMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.‚Äù Read the full article .

In Donald Trump's ¬†case ‚Äì as in so much in his journey to the become 45th President of the United States ‚Äì the questions were much less highflown. Would he speak to the nation in the same way that he had campaigned across it? Would he seek to heal the nation - to make America Whole Again? Well now we know. President Trump had a script and he delivered it well. Those who had attended his election rallies became used to his delivery - a stream of consciousness interrupted periodically by a chant of "USA! USA!" whenever he lost his train of thought. This was a vast improvement on those rambling monologues.

Spirited demonstrations unfolded peacefully at various security checkpoints near the Capitol as police helped ticket-holders get through to the inaugural ceremony. Signs read, "Resist Trump Climate Justice Now," "Let Freedom Ring," "Free Palestine." But at one point, police gave chase to a group of about 100 protesters who smashed the windows of downtown businesses including a Starbucks, Bank of America and McDonald's as they denounced capitalism and Trump. Police in riot gear used pepper spray from large canisters and eventually cordoned off the protesters.  Obama's long goodbye comes to an end as he assures country he will be 'right there with you' arack Obama bid farewell to the US presidency yesterday and assured the nation, as Donald Trump took control of the White House, that he would be "right there with you". The former president flew out from Andrews Air Force Base in Washington with his wife Michelle, the former first lady, and daughters Malia and Sasha, immediately after Mr Trump's inauguration ceremony. The Obamas flew to Palm Springs, California, for a holiday where he is expected to relax on the golf course, enjoy spending time with his daughters and begin considering the multi-million-dollar offers for the rights to the highly-anticipated memoirs he will now write. Mr Obama told his staff, many of whom were emotional, that the end of his eight-year two-term presidency should not signal the death of his drive for hope and change. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a period, it‚Äôs a comma, in the continuing story that is America,‚Äù he said. "This has been the privilege of my life, and I know I speak for Michelle as well... I can‚Äôt wait to see what you do next, and I promise I‚Äôll be right there with you. Yes we did. Yes we can." The Obamas launched a new website, Obama.org, with the initial aim of helping them develop projects for his new presidential centre on Chicago's South Side. r Obama said the foundation's projects would be developed "all over the city, the country and the world". He asked Americans to "tell us what you want this project to be and tell us what's on your mind". After their holiday, the family will fly straight back to Washington, where Sasha, 15, is finishing secondary school. They will live in a nine-bedroom rented house in the Kalorama neighbourhood of the capital, which has an estimated monthly rent of $22,000. Their neighbours will include Ivanka Trump, the new first daughter, and her husband Jared Kushner, who will act as Mr Trump's senior adviser. The Obamas are both expected to negotiate highly lucrative book deals for their memoirs, with some estimates that, combined, they could earn $45 million. The former president said at his final White House press conference on Wednesday that he "wanted to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much". ‚ÄúI want to do some writing.... I want to spend precious time with my girls,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThose are my priorities this year.‚Äù Mr Obama is already the most successful presidential author since Theodore Roosevelt, who was prolific, writing 42 books including Hunting Trips of a Ranchman. ‚ÄúHis is going to be easily the most valuable presidential memoir ever,‚Äù said Raphael Sagalyn from the ICM/Sagalyn Literary Agency. ‚ÄúAnd I think Michelle Obama has the opportunity to sell the most valuable first lady memoir in history.‚Äù The former president already collects significant royalties for his acclaimed 1995 memoir, Dreams From My Father and his 2006 book, The Audacity of Hope. His global popularity - he enjoys approval ratings of more than 80 per cent in several countries - is likely to make the book a hit across the world. Mrs Obama is incredibly popular across the political spectrum, at home and abroad. Mr Obama will also be paid a lifelong presidential pension that works out around $200,000 a year.

The Trump administration posted a series of statements under the 'issues' section of the WhiteHouse.gov website - including a pledge that Mr Obama's ¬†climate change policies would be abolished. The White House website listed several actions Mr Trump will take to cancel "harmful and unnecessary policies." Among them are Mr Obama's climate action plan and a clean water rule imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The climate plan is intended as a broad-based strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. The plan includes a series of rules that limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. The water rule is intended to protect smaller streams, tributaries and wetlands from development.

While Ralph Lauren is widely regarded as a quintessential American label, German designer Lagerfeld, who is based in Paris and designs under three brands - Chanel, Fendi and his own eponymous fashion line - would be a notable choice for the former model. Michelle Obama opted for a yellow suit by Cuban-American designer Isabel Toledo for Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration ceremony, and a one-shouldered white silk chiffon gown to the evening inaugural balls, designed by New York-based Jason Wu. n 2013 she chose a belted blue-checked coat by Thom Browne for the daytime ceremony and a red halterneck gown for the evening, again by Jason Wu. Both Lauren, who was Hillary Clinton's go-to designer during the presidential campaign, and Lagerfeld are very well known brands, which would also mark a departure from the tradition of the First Lady shining a spotlight on relatively unknown labels. Mrs Clinton opted for Sarah Phillips and Laura Bush chose Michael Faircloth to design their gowns for their first inauguration balls, both lesser-known designers whom they had worn before. Mr¬†Trump's own fashion choices have been the subject of controversy because he has stated a preference for suits by Italian menswear label Brioni, writing in his book¬†Trump: Think Like A Billionaire that the brand supplied him with suits for The Apprentice. Brioni also has a boutique in the newly-opened¬†Trump¬†International Hotel in Washington DC. In July 2016, GQ's associate style editor Nick Carvell wrote: "What does that say of a man who espouses the need to create more American jobs for American people - then wears clothes cut by European designers?" Whatever Mrs¬†Trump¬†chooses today will take its place in fashion history. The First Lady's inauguration gown is typically donated to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Nigel Farage parties in Washington y in Washington DC Brexit was great but Donald Trump becoming the president of the United States "is Brexit plus, plus, plus" Nigel Farage told a party thrown for the former Ukip leader in Washington on the eve of Mr Trump's inauguration.

Mr Trump did not attend. Mr Farage told an audience of 200 at the party: ‚ÄúBrexit was great but Trump becoming the president of the USA is Brexit plus, plus, plus.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI have spent most of my life in politics as the patron saint of lost causes, having to spend several hours every day drowning my sorrows with English pints of beer because that‚Äôs all I ever did. ‚ÄúI really believe this for most of my life what happens in America in terms of social trends or developments we follow four or five years later.

Like Mr Trump, the former Republican president's election came at a time when America's faith in Washington was especially low. In response, Mr Trump's transition team have laid out plans that would dramatically cut back the size and bureaucracy of government, by reducing federal spending by some $10.5 trillion over the coming decade. The detailed proposal, ¬†which has not yet been made public, but whose contents has been leaked to The Hill, a Washington based media company promises cuts to welfare programs across government agencies. But critics of Mr Trump said last night that the size of the budget cuts are unrealistic, unless the new administration reduces military spending and healthcare, two areas that the new president has so far promised to protect. The¬†inauguration¬†is expected to draw 800,000 spectators, according to officials. Even as many celebrities and musicians have turned down invitations to perform at the event, organisers have gone out of their way to make the event a memorable affair. On Thursday it was reported that ten wild mustang horses, who had been tamed and trained in a Kansas prison, are to take part in the parade from the US capitol to the White House. Dexter Hedrick who leads the prison horse training program, said the inmates are "taking great pride in knowing that they contributed to something so meaningful". Mr Trump's election victory has¬†inflamed the passions of American voters across the political spectrum. Thousands have descended on Washington to protest Mr Trump's election with an array of demonstrations. Some have vowed to "shut down" with inauguration, by attempting to close down 12 security checkpoints along the route of the inaugural parade. In a calmer protest, DCMJ, a local pro-marijuana advocacy group will be handing out 4,200 free joints (which is legal under Washington law).
