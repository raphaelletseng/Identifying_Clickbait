Here's what it's like to interview for the CIA, from people who have done it


The Central Intelligence Agency is a well-known, yet highly-secretive branch of the intelligence community, butÂ we know a little bit about how to get a job there thanks to Glassdoor.

The job site where anyone can rate their workplace and give an inside look at how to apply and interview has a page just for the CIA, which currently has a rating of 3.6 out of five stars. More than 40Â people have left feedback on their interview process.

The reviews could not be independently verified since they were left anonymously, though many of the questions and background info seemsÂ to match up with other thingsÂ already known about the CIA.
