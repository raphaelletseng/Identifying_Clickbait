Uber claims written English test will put thousands of drivers out of work
ber has claimed that thousands of its drivers in London will be put out of work if Transport for London forces them to pass English tests , saying the move creates indirect racial discrimination. The American car-hailing app is fighting a High Court battle against TfL’s plans to require private hire drivers to have an English qualification, hoping to have the rules thrown out on discrimination grounds. Lawyers for Uber said the transport body’s own calculations suggested that 33,000 out of the more than 110,000 private hire drivers in London would fail the test, which will be required for those who do not already have qualifications such as GCSE certificates. om de la Mare QC said the TfL proposals would have a major effect on drivers from countries where English is not generally spoken, leading to "indirect discrimination on grounds of race and nationality". He said that current pass rates at Trinity College, where the tests take place, showed that 98pc of drivers can pass speaking and listening tests but just 55pc pass the reading and writing portion – a test that Uber says is unnecessary. TfL, which plans to introduce the English language requirement for anyone renewing their private hire licence in September, said: “We continue to robustly defend this claim”
