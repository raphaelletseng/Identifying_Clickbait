Tim Tebow Strikes out on 4 Pitches in 1st Spring Training At-Bat with Mets
Tim Tebow made his first start of the spring for the New York Mets as he made a spot start from minor-league camp, and it just happened to come against reigning American League Cy Young winner Rick Porcello. You can pretty much guess how that ended. Tebow, who is less than a year into his professional baseball career, was simply overmatched against one of the game's best pitchers. He went down on four pitches, although the third strike appeared to be out of the zone. Facing Porcello is a tough assignment for any batter, especially this early in the spring. But for as much as you can take away from one spring at-bat, the quarterback-turned-baseball-player has a long way to go before he can even dream about playing in the big leagues.
