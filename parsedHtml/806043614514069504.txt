PNG Parliament employee accused of pulling gun on fuel attendant who refused to refuel car

Updated

The Speaker of Papua New Guinea's national parliament, Theodore Zurenuoc, has confirmed a member of his staff is being investigated for allegedly using a gun to threaten other workers who would not refuel his car.

Port Moresby police received a report last week that a man armed with a pistol had ordered Parliament fuel attendants to fill up his private vehicle.

Local media reports said Parliament workers initially refused the man's request because it breached the official refuelling procedure.

Mr Zurenouc said the incident was now a police matter.

"Yes, I am embarrassed," he said.

"No-one should be carrying a firearm and threatening other Parliament workers."

Mr Zurenouc confirmed the gun belonged to the Parliament.

"How he had access to the firearm is a mystery," he said.

The Speaker said the man had not been disciplined yet, because investigations were still underway.

Local police confirmed they had received a complaint from Parliament staff and were investigating.
