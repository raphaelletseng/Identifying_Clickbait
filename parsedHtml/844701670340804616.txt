For Some Reason, Durex Condom Brand Is Launching a Jean Line
In a move that makes absolutely no sense, Durex condom brand is venturing into the fashion business. As pointed out by Mashable , Durex India recently announced it will launch its first-ever denim line later this week. The company teased the jeans Wednesday in a Twitter video, which starred brand ambassador and popular Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh. “Hi guys. Durex is launching Jeans, and I’m gonna be the first one to wear it,” Singh says in the teaser before getting behind a fitting room curtain and yelling, “Guys, this fits really well.” We’re launching Jeans! And Ranveer’s gonna be trying out his first ever. Excited? Well, that’s our speciality! #DurexJeans  pic.twitter.com/5UpIJFVBfw It’s cheesy as hell, but it’s not like anyone is taking this seriously. Soon after Durex Jeans was announced, people went to social media to taunt the company's new business venture.
