Here’s Who’s Winning (And Losing) At WrestleMania 33
We’re mere days away from “The Show of Shows.” "The Grandest Stage of Them All." "The Showcase of the Immortals." It’s WrestleMania 33, where a year’s worth of professional wrestling feuds comes to a head. As always, there’s a mixture of old and new. There are the veterans, like Goldberg, The Undertaker, and Brock Lesnar, who draw in the casual, nostalgic fans. There are the established stars, like AJ Styles, Roman Reigns, and Sasha Banks, who represent the here and now. And there are the rising stars, like Braun Strowman, Baron Corbin, and Bayley, who represent the future of the company. Here are your up-to-date predictions for an interesting—if divisive—evening, this Sunday at 7 p.m. ET.
