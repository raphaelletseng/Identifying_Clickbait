'You don't belong here' - solicitor caught on film launching racist attack on woman and her young son
solicitor has been caught on film launching a racist attack on a mother and her young son while they were sat on a first class train carriage. Alexander 'AJ' MacKinnon, 47, was filmed hurling abuse at Sanaa Shahid and her four-year-old son Zayn as they travelled home to Glasgow. The video captures MacKinnon saying Mrs Shahid did not "belong" in the country before swearing at her young son. Mrs Shahid, who has lived in Scotland her whole life, claimed MacKinnon demanded to know where she was born and told her she did not "deserve" to be in first class. MacKinnon admitted a racially aggravated public order offence when he appeared at Carlisle Magistrates Court on Tuesday. He was fined £1154, plus £50 compensation, a £150 victim surcharge and £85 in court costs. Highest praise for the train manager on 2.30pm train from London Euston to Glasgow -29/12/2016 when we were racially targeted @VirginTrains n the video, MacKinnon appears to be very drunk and can be seen drinking red wine straight from a bottle. Speaking on the phone to a friend, he says: "It's my word against hers. I'm going to get off the train if it stops if it stops at Carlisle and wait for another...she doesn't belong in this country. "Now she'll accuse me of insulting her and discrimination." At this point a man who appears to work for Virgin Trains approaches MacKinnon and tells him, "See now it's not just her word, it's mine as well because I heard it all. "You'll have to accept you're a drunken racist and you need to get off the train." MacKinnon goes on: "I'm not a racist, I love people actually. "You're so wonderful wasting police time, miss, and you're f***ing son." MacKinnon reportedly 'liked' Donald Trump, English Defence League, the BNP, the Scottish BNP and various Scottish Conservative associations on social media and posted articles about former Ukip leader Nigel Farage prior to the incident but these have since been removed . Mrs Shahid, herself a lawyer, said the abuse started after MacKinnon began behaving aggressively towards her son. MacKinnon told the pair they "didn't deserve" to be in first class, Mrs Shahid claimed. Mrs Shahid praised train staff for assisting her during the incident, which took place at 2.30pm on December 29 after the family went to visit her husband Aftab, 36.
