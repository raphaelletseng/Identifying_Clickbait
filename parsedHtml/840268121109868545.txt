More Pink Air Jordans for Girls


While the approach of adding pink to Air Jordan retros for girls has been criticized in the past, Jordan Brand isn't going to abandon it anytime soon. An upcoming girls' Air Jordan 7 leaked on Friday, this one mixing hyper pink accents in with a mostly black colorway.

According to leaker @zsneakerheadz on Instagram, this Air Jordan 7 GG style will release on April 29. The shoes will come with the $140 price standard for Jordan GG retro releases.

2017 has other new colorways for the Air Jordan 7 in store, with a "Pure Money" pair on the way and a "Pantone" pair set to hit retail after years of exclusivity.
