‘I Didn’t Want to Lose My Identity’: 16,000 Readers Reflect on Their Surnames
‘I Didn’t Want to Lose My Identity’: 16,000 Readers Reflect on Their Surnames
“Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!” the other children would shout, teasing Katherine Yuk all through elementary school about her Chinese last name. “When I was a child and a new immigrant in Canada, I longed for the day when I could get married and take someone else’s last name,” she wrote. Ms. Yuk was one of more than 16,000 readers who responded when The New York Times asked women around the world why they had kept or changed their surnames when they married. Letter From London Grappling With My Family’s Identity in a Post-Brexit Europe Six months after Brexit, the world of a Times reporter’s children remains inclusive, but she finds a changing Britain and feels her German heritage more than before. By the time she had the chance, Ms. Yuk wrote, her thinking had come around. She decided to embrace and keep her name, despite the teasing. Advertisement “I hadn’t only survived it, but it had defined me — as someone who was different yet proud of those differences, a survivor of childhood bullying, a first-generation immigrant with a funny last name who had found her own skin and found her own opportunities and identity,” said Ms. Yuk, now 45 and living in Toronto. “I didn’t want to lose my identity.” Advertisement Women from a variety of nationalities, religions, sexual orientations and ages wrote to The Times about how their names were a core part of who they were. For many, the decision on whether to change their names carried significant weight, and it was shaped by the traditions, the norms and, in some cases, the laws of the societies in which they live. Some looked to their names as badges of cultural identity, others as symbolic links to their fathers that they were eager to preserve, or to sever. Here are some of the responses. They have been edited and condensed. Pride in a name and its connections “My husband had no family. He graduated college before we even met. He walked across a stage for his degree with no family or friends in attendance. He was the first (and only) person in his circle to complete college. When our son was born, after he filled out and signed the birth certificate, he looked at me and said, ‘And then there were three.’” “I have a long Spanish surname, which marked me as different growing up in an otherwise homogeneous white Anglican rural area in Australia. My name was hard to pronounce, hard to spell. I used to blush every time a new teacher tried and failed to pronounce it out loud. But after a few years, I became strangely proud of my surname and it was firmly part of my identity. “Every time now that someone struggles to pronounce it, it links me to memories of my school years, as well as to the story of my family (most of whom I never met) who fled as refugees to a new and safer country.” “Quebec law requires that spouses keep their name. There was no decision to be made. Some women in Quebec use their husband’s name after marriage in social settings. However, I will continue using my own name. My father is an Armenian immigrant from Lebanon, and I am proud to use his name to show that children of immigrants contribute positively to society.” “Right when we got engaged, my husband offered to take my name. I didn’t ask him for it, but I took it as a symbol of his love and commitment. Even now that we are two years married, my heart makes a little jump every time he answers the phone with ‘Benjamin Vogels.’” “I am deeply attached to my father’s family — my paternal grandmother was widowed during the Great Depression with five children (and one in utero) to raise without family or financial assistance. She persevered and kept the family together. My father’s older brothers (one underage when he enlisted) fought in World War II, while his sisters quit school to work and support the family in their brothers’ absence. The sacrifice and integrity of my grandmother and my father and his siblings have influenced and inspired me in countless ways. “After my husband died, I was on my own with our 2- and 5-year-old sons and without family support. I embraced the lessons of my father’s family and carried on.” “I had been married previously, and did not want to keep that name. But I also did not want to return to my maiden name. With fear and trepidation, my partner and I sat down with her parents, and I asked them if I could take their family name. Without blinking, both of her parents said, in unison, ‘We’d be honored!’ Can you imagine my relief?” “Most importantly, it is out of a deep respect for my mother. When I was 8 years old, my mother made the decision to take her maiden name back. This was in the 1970s. We lived in a small town in northern Maine, and she wrote for the local paper. She received harassing phone calls and harsh objections from family and friends. People even wrote in to the paper about it, stating that she was not a ‘good Christian woman.’ People made harsh comments to me about it as well. I remember not understanding, and wishing my mom could just be a ‘normal’ wife and mother. “Later, in my 20s, while attending university and taking women’s studies courses, I came to feel proud of my mom. I gained a deep respect for how difficult and important her decision was.” Cross-cultural marriages and lives “We both wanted to show the world that we belong together. For us and our children, it symbolizes that we are a unique unit on equal footing and that our children have a dual cultural heritage from both Sweden and Denmark, though they were born in South Africa.” “I’m a white woman who married a Japanese man, and didn’t connect to having a Japanese last name.” “I wanted future generations to be able to find me easily when they research the first relations to move to the States.” “When I asked my husband if our kids could have my name, he said no. I was surprised; in many ways, he’s progressive, but in this, he was very: ‘No, my children, my name.’ “At first, this didn’t bother me — what’s in a name, anyway? But lately, I keep thinking about heritage. My name is my father’s father’s, who emigrated from Norway. At Christmas, I think about the Norwegian traditions and feel a kinship to them, even though the rest of me — most of me! — isn’t Norwegian at all. It’s just my name. Like me, my husband’s family is from all over, but his name is Russian. My kids are going to have a Russian name, even though there hasn’t been a Russian in the family for centuries.” “I wouldn’t mind taking his surname, and it would be nice to do the traditional thing like that. But I still can’t get around my personal feelings about the potential problems I would face looking the way I do and having a surname like his. Even though a lot of the anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe are aimed at other ethnicities, I’m worried about the barbed treatment I might get, or suspicions that I’m trying to ‘mask’ or ‘whitewash’ my identity.” Advertisement Social and family traditions “In Chinese culture, women keep their last names after marriage.
