With this 3 Steph Curry passed Kobe Bryant for 11th on the all-time 3-Point FG list! #ThisIsWhyWePlay https://t.co/HqKZPO7zxb Curry, 28, may own every three-point record by the time his career is finished. I e set the NBA record for most threes made (402) and attempted (886) in a single season. And he trails only Steve Kerr (45.4 percent) and Hubert Davis (44.0 percent) in career three-point percentage as Curry has made 43.8Â percent of his shots from beyond the arc. The all-time record for made three-pointers is within his grasp, too. Ray Allen currently holds the record with 2,973 made three-point field goals, a mark Curry could feasibly break within the next five years. Given that Golden State's sharpshooter has made at least 230 threes in five straight seasons, he's on pace to catch Allen before long. You likely won't find many folks betting against the two-time defending MVP and four-time All-Star. Still, Curry's mindset will be on leading the Warriors to their second NBA title in the past three seasons. With Kevin Durant in the fold, the Warriors have been the favorites to do just that since the summer. But along the way, Curry might move up a few more spots on the three-point leaderboard. He now has Chauncey Billups (1,830 threes) and Joe Johnson (1,902 threes) in his crosshairs. As the Warriors continue to win, Curry continues to carve his name into the record books.
