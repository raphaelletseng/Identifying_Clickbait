(Photo: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images) Six days after the release of GoPro’s first-ever drone in October, Brian Warholak was itching to get airborne. As an employee at a Virginia-based government contractor, had few opportunities during the workweek to fly his new toy. But on Friday, he left his desk early, unpacked his GoPro Karma from its carrying case and set it on a manicured lawn near the company parking lot. In the video of Warholak’s aeronautic excursion, the drone lurches upward, pausing for its master to pan the attached camera. What it captures initially is unremarkable: a nondescript office building and mostly empty car park. Then, two minutes into the voyage, the device bricks. Its four propellers cut out and the drone begins a five-second, 170-foot free fall toward earth. It smacks a few tree branches on the way down for good measure and lands camera upward to capture its owner rushing to the crash. “F***, now where is the rest?” Warholak is heard saying on the video. “Son of a b****.” In an interview with FORBES, Warholak said he thought the crash was his fault and wondered what he did wrong. After the incident, he picked up the drone’s pieces, drove home and uploaded the disastrous flight footage to YouTube. It was the first popular public video of a Karma crash, and soon, it would set off alarm bells at GoPro’s San Mateo, Calif. headquarters. Within a few days, more crash films like Warholak’s popped up online and the company issued a recall. The sky was falling for the camera maker’s new product. Ahead of an earnings call on Thursday, when GoPro CEO Nicholas Woodman is expected to discuss his company’s fourth quarter financial results and the issues behind Karma, FORBES talked to multiple industry insiders, including people familiar with GoPro's drone project. While some asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing jobs or relationships, they revealed why the action-camera maker encountered so many issues with its flagship drone and the history behind its development. “I wouldn’t say it’s the beginning of the end," said Craig Elder an autonomous vehicle expert and former director of software engineering at drone startup 3D Robotics. “Karma was their attempt to change direction, but like so many people, they underestimated how difficult it is to build an autonomous vehicle.” GoPro's bumpy ride began with its June 2014 initial public offering, before it got into the drone game. While its stock price initially shot up and remained above its $24 per share IPO price through most of 2015, slowing sales, failed entertainment ventures and an inability to innovate beyond its core product line hampered growth. GoPro’s drone, initially rumored in Nov. 2014, was supposed to reverse its fortunes and make it more than just a camera company. Instead, Karma became an encapsulation of everything that has gone wrong with the company. As GoPro’s research and development costs rose steadily with the continued emphasis on the drone program, the company has little to show for its efforts and expense. Karma did hit shelves in time for the 2016 holiday season, despite multiple delays, but its recall ensured that it missed a crucial period to build market share among consumers. Meanwhile Chinese drone maker DJI, GoPro's main competitor and former potential partner, holds its position as the industry’s far-and-away leader. Last month, Woodman, speaking on-stage at Las Vegas' Consumer Electronics Show, said that Karma’s issues were due to a power failure. The battery “would become decoupled from the connector, which would cause a power loss during flight,” he said in the interview with A GoPro spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Analyzed in the context of its competitive environment, GoPro is not alone in its drone missteps. Berkeley, Calif.-based 3D Robotics imploded after raising about $120 million in venture funding; French consumer electronics manufacturer Parrot recently laid off 290 people, or 35%, of its drone workforce; and Lily Robotics, a well-funded San Francisco startup that sold $34 million worth of pre-orders, is folding amidst a consumer protection lawsuit accusing the company of falsely advertising its flying camera. However, as a $1.5 billion-dollar company that spent months hyping its drone, GoPro has changed its road map, based, in part on Karma's recall. While Woodman was relatively forthright in Las Vegas about Karma’s power issue, he did not detail his company’s frantic search for the problem in the days after Warholak’s video was posted on YouTube. Karma’s failure has triggered plenty of uncertainty within the company, said one former employee, who left before the company axed about 200 people, or 15% of its workforce, 22 days after the recall. On Wednesday, the company re-launched Karma, though it remains to be seen if it will ever win back the confidence of its customers. “In hindsight, they bit off way more than they could chew,” said Wedbush Securities’ Michael Pachter. “And they are still snarky and arrogant about it. They still haven’t acknowledged how hard it was. They said it was the best drone on the market and we all believed them.” For its first 12 years, GoPro worked toward perfecting the form and performance of its action cameras. That focus turned GoPro into a consumer electronics success as Woodman sought to put his devices on anything that could offer a unique perspective, from surfboards to rally cars to drones. That changed in Feb. 2013, when Colin Guinn, then the North American head of little-known drone manufacturer DJI, approached Woodman in the parking lot at GoPro’s headquarters. As Woodman tried to brush him aside, Guinn, an enthusiastic salesman, launched DJI’s new Phantom drone into the air. The device immediately entranced Woodman, who grew up piloting remote-controlled gliders in the hills near his family’s home in Atherton, Calif. The GoPro CEO spent the next hour flying the drone, delaying a few meetings in the process. That encounter was the first of a series of get-togethers between the two companies. At the time, few consumer electronics corporations were growing as fast as GoPro. Woodman’s darling was more than doubling sales of its action cameras each year, and investors had sold an 8.9% chunk in the company to Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn (also known as Industry Co.) the previous December. That deal valued GoPro at $2.25 billion and made Woodman a billionaire. DJI, on the other hand, was tiny. It had just debuted its signature four-propeller Phantom drone, which was GoPro compatible, in January, and was a Chinese manufacturer that primarily catered to R/C helicopter hobbyists. In meetings brokered by Guinn, DJI CEO Frank Wang and Woodman discussed how the companies could work together to build a drone, though GoPro wanted their brand on the device. Wang was taken aback by what he perceived as Woodman's arrogance, according to a person familiar with those meetings, and plotted to eventually develop his own line of cameras. DJI declined to comment for this piece, as did Guinn, who no longer works at the company. “Initially [GoPro and DJI] wanted to make a product together for GoPro to sell, but the negotiation never came to fruition,” Wang told FORBES in May 2015. “They treated us like the original equipment manufacturers. The deal came out to roughly this: GoPro would make two points of profit, and I’d make one point. I didn’t want it like that. I thought it should be, I make two points of profit, and [GoPro] makes one point of profit, because the product, from the beginning to the end, would have been mine.” By Jan. 2014, any possibility of a deal between the two was dead and GoPro set out to make a drone of its own. Woodman and Fabrice Barbier, then a senior vice president of product development, took meetings at CES, expecting to form a team that could produce a flying robot to be ready for release in 12 months. Concurrently, GoPro explored other partnerships, particularly with 3D Robotics, the United States’ best-funded drone startup. Eventually Woodman agreed to work with 3DR on its drone, Solo, which would specifically operate with a GoPro camera. GoPro gave the startup unprecedented internal software access to its cameras in order to facilitate a smooth integration between the two products and 3DR, which was set to ship Solo in the spring of 2015, would be the first third-party company to use a sanctioned GoPro logo on its box. The GoPro and 3DR relationship, however, was an uneasy one. GoPro poached 3DR product manager Pablo Lema during talks to lead its own drone project. And while 3DR executives, including CEO Chris Anderson, never felt threatened by GoPro, according to several former employees, it was clear that the companies were on a competitive path. In November, reported that GoPro, which had gone public in June and whose shares hit an all-time high in October, was developing its own line of consumer drones that would debut the following year. story set the clock ticking on GoPro. It excited GoPro enthusiasts, who saw drones as a completely new way to capture footage. For investors, it meant product diversification, as the company would no longer depend only on the sales of its cameras. At CES in Jan. 2015, Woodman noted that “drones were good for GoPro” but declined to address whether his company was working on anything. "It's so much better to tease you guys,” he said on stage. “I could string this along for five years." Woodman ended that charade a few months later in May, when he appeared on stage at Code Conference to announce the company’s quadcopter. It was official. GoPro would be releasing its drone in the first half of 2016. A crowd of mainly tech executives met the declaration with lukewarm cheers and a few claps. Internally the pressure to produce mounted, according to those familiar with GoPro's environment at the time. As its relationship with 3D Robotics petered out following Solo’s own shipping issues, GoPro poured large amounts of resources into its own unmanned aerial vehicle program. The company hired influential developers from the open source drone community and brought in other UAV startups to learn how they built a device from scratch, said one source. Between Dec. 2014 and the company's quarter ending on Sept. 30 last year, quarterly research and development expenditures ballooned from $46 million to $96 million. As GoPro's drone division pressed on, the company's once-strong business foundation eroded. It missed wide of the mark on its revenue guidance in Oct. 2015 and took a $19 million charge due to its inability to sell its newest camera, the cube-like Session. Woodman admitted the company priced the device too high and shares fell more than 17% to trade near its original IPO price of $24. External market pressures also didn’t help with morale and drone development was slow. Some blamed unreasonable deadlines. Others pointed to management like Pablo Lema, who had earlier been hired away from 3DR. “Pablo was essentially an amateur pilot and in awe of the technology, but didn’t understand what it takes to make a vehicle operate," said one source. "He had a good understanding of what people would be buying and his education was in business. But he had no technical background.” In May 2016, GoPro pushed back the date of its drone unveiling to buy itself more time, but aimed to get the device manufactured before the crucial Christmas period. "While we had to make the difficult decision to delay our drone, Karma, the upside is that Karma's launch should now benefit from the holidays," Woodman said in a statement. It didn't quite work that way. While Woodman introduced Karma at a splashy event at the Squaw Valley Ski Resort near Lake Tahoe, Calif. in September, GoPro recalled its drone a little more than a month later following the series of well-documented crashes. “If a GoPro freezes or an iPhone freezes, I turn it off,” said one person. “All I have to do is hold two buttons down until I’m back running. If that happens to a drone, it flies away or falls out of the sky.” Initially, GoPro's engineers had no idea what was causing those crashes, said one source within the company, but they began mapping out a series of potential problems. At the top of the list was a battery issue that had been featured in a number of YouTube videos where users complained that the drone’s battery wouldn't slide and lock properly into place. In one video by Karma customer Kennard Yamada, the device’s battery port did not align with the power source, leaving the battery partially sticking out of the back of the drone until it was forced in. GoPro also hired an outside team of UAV experts to diagnose the problem. Composed of at least three former 3D Robotics engineers, the team, whose motivation was to prevent DJI from extending its stranglehold on the market, traveled to San Mateo in December and stayed for a few weeks to root out the problem. Eventually it was determined that a physical design flaw in the drone's battery port prevented the battery from locking into place, sometimes causing a decoupling of the power supply during flight. Members of that team, including former 3D Robotics Philip Rowse and Jeff Wurzbach, declined to speak for this story. Internally, the recall, which affected 2,500 devices, was highlighted as the right choice, taking a potentially dangerous product off the market before it became a popular device. Other companies like 3D Robotics and DJI have drones fly off and crash all the time, but they've never recalled anything, said one engineer on GoPro's drone team. Still, others questioned how the issue happened in the first place, blaming the pressure to hit shipping deadlines and an underestimation of how difficult it would be to develop a UAV. DJI, which released the cheaper, smaller Mavic drone shortly after GoPro’s Karma launch, became the beneficiary of its competitor's delays in spite of production problems of its own. The recall and GoPro’s flailing stock price led to 15% layoffs, downsizing of its entertainment aims and an overall retrenching of the business. According to multiple sources, GoPro parted ways with Fabrice Barbier, who was most recently its senior vice president of consumer devices, and tightened its focus on being a lean consumer product company. “We’re guilty of having reached too far and we stumbled," Woodman said at CES in January. "We’ve decided to return back to that very focused business that does just a few things extremely well, instead of doing too many things marginally." The real question is if consumers and investors still think GoPro can do those few things well. On Wednesday following the re-release of its drone, users within a private Facebook group, “GoPro Karma Owners,” complained about previous customer service experiences, while others excitedly announced that they had re-ordered the device to give it another shot. Some were skeptical.    Trending on {{channel_name}}
