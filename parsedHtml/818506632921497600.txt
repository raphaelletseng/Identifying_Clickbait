The One Thing Donald Trump Finds Underrated, According To His Tweets
The One Thing Donald Trump Finds Underrated, According To His Tweets
Streep DeMille “This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing,” Streep said to applause. “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” In typical fashion, Trump took to Twitter in the early hours of Monday morning to reply to Streep’s comments. “Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes,” he tweeted. “She is a Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never ‘mocked’ a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him 'groveling' when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!” The jab at Streep, of course, weren’t the first time Trump has called a popular public figure overrated. He’s done it to everybody from conservatives media personalities to comedians. Here’s a quick rundown of all the folks our incoming POTUS thinks could be taken down a peg. Hamilton The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior Megyn Kelly, over and over again Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, & the most overrated person on tv. Highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn! So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly , is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong! . @megynkelly , the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews , worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15! The Clintons No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT Former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! Conservative political analyst George Will George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls George Will may be the dumbest(and most overrated) political commentator of all time. If the Republicans listen to him, they will lose. Dopey @GeorgeWill , the most overrated political pundit in the business, continues to downgrade the Republican (cont) http://t.co/c0EnzLzE (Lil’) Marco Rubio Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn’t hire to run one of my smaller companies - a highly overrated politician! Jon Stewart I promise you that I'm much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz - I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow . Who, by the way, is totally overrated. As I’ve said many times before, Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is highly overrated. While Jon Stewart is a joke, not very bright and totally overrated, some losers and haters will miss him and his dumb clown humor. Too bad! Jerry Seinfeld " @kanikagahlaut : Can anyone explain why @JerrySeinfeld is so unfunny on twitter and @realDonaldTrump is so funny?" Jerry is highly overrated Barack Obama, of course Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history. There is, however, one person, place or thing Trump has called underrated in his long history on Twitter: Former Yankees pitcher Hiroki Kuroda Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher. Kuroda pitched for the New York Yankees from 2012 to 2014. Trump may have been on the money when it comes to the Japanese baseball star. New York Sports Day’s Steven Simineri called Kuroda, “consistently one of the more underappreciated pitchers in the big show.” So, that’s something.

During Sunday’s Golden Globes, actress Meryl Streep was given the Cecil B. DeMille Award and ripped President-elect Donald Trump in her acceptance speech, focusing on an incident in which the Republican politician mocked a disabled reporter during a rally in South Carolina when he was a running for president.

“This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing,” Streep said to applause. “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.”

In typical fashion, Trump took to Twitter in the early hours of Monday morning to reply to Streep’s comments.

“Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes,” he tweeted. “She is a Hillary flunky who lost big.
