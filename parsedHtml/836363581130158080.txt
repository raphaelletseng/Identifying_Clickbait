DJ Khaled Is Planning Something Major With Chance the Rapper, Justin Bieber, and Migos
DJ Khaled , ever the excellent promoter, sent out a bunch of pictures on his Instagram Monday showing him with Justin Bieber , Migos , and Chance the Rapper , and imploring his five million followers to keep the whole thing a secret. Bieber's manager Scooter Braun and Young Money president Mack Maine are also in the cut. As we're sure you already figured out, this likely has to do with his upcoming album, . Its expected release date is March 22, so we're guessing we'll all find out whatever the hell classified info he's talking about then. It's not too long of a wait. Monday's pics and clips follow previous news that teased potential collaborations with Travis Scott and Mariah Carey . As you likely figured when "Shining," his single with Beyoncé and Jay Z, released, he's setting the table for a major release here. As you'll notice when you scroll down, there's a theme here. Everyone at the gathering is tight-lipped. Also, it's a lot of pics (and vids) so hopefully your computer doesn't crash trying to load them: Fan luv I'm on #GRATEFUL video set!!!
