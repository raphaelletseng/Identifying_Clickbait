Oh hell yeah, look how big this turtle is
Oh hell yeah, look how big this turtle is
Damn, you guys gotta get a look at this turtle. Two people from New Zealand were on a boat and they saw this big turtle and filmed it. Good on those two because wow, I would not have believed them if they didn't have it on camera. I mean, hell yeah at the size of this thing. Throw some wheels on this guy and you've got a Toyota Camry, you know what I mean? You could eat a Thanksgiving dinner with your whole family on the back of this guy. Pippa Partington and her husband Craig spotted the turtle (a leatherback sea turtle, to be exact) off the coast of Mangawhai on December 6. Dang.Â
