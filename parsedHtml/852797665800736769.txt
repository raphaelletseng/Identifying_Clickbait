His fellow divers said that he disappeared as the rest of the group made their way to the surface.

An NSRI spokesman said: 'According to fellow divers on a charter scuba dive they had been surfacing when the man had disappeared.

'During the search‚ the remains of the body of the man‚ believed to have been bitten by a shark‚ were located by crew of a private fishing boat.

'The remains of the body were recovered from the water onto a sea rescue craft and brought to shore.

Protea Banks is a reef just 4 miles off the South African coast and attracts thousands of scuba divers each year.

Diving enthusiasts typically travel to the area because of the large number of tiger and bull sharks which live there.
