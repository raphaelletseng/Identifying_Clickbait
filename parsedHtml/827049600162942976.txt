Twitter and mistaken identities go hand in hand. Seems like not a day goes past that someone isn't getting the hate (or praise) that's meant for someone else with the same name.

This particular story is a little more unusual though, given that it involves a comedian, a famous musician and, uh, the son of the President Of The United States.

See, Shannon Noll is an American comedian known for her off-kilter impressions, as well as her self-described likeness to Barron Trump. In fact, she's putting on a play called Barron Trump: Up Past Bedtime. But the controversial decision to "take aim" at Trump's 10-year-old son means she's coming serious under fire.Â

And this, friends, is where the other Shannon Noll comes in.

See, Australia has a Shannon Noll too. He was the runner-up in Australian Idol way back in 2003, and he is a kind of a beloved national figure â€” albeit one that people sometimes like to gently make fun of. Good bloke.

So while people have been taking to Twitter, intent on blasting American Shannon Noll, they have instead been making fun of old mate, Aussie Shannon Noll A.K.A. @NOLLSIE. Poor Nollsie!
