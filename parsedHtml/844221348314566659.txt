Then I was told do not move. I was instantly hand cuffed before being asked to identify myself Nor was I told why I was being cuffed. In the process I said my name and told them they have wrong person. They proceeded to ignore me and I was treated like a criminal until other police showed up and pointed out they had wrong person.
