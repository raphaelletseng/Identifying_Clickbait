A 26-year-old Australian woman has died in an early morning scooter crash in Bali.

The initial report from North Kuta police said it appeared the woman lost control of the scooter about 3:00am on Thursday. No other vehicles were involved.

North Kuta traffic police chief Putu Wiratma said the woman was found face-down in a drainage ditch, with her nose and mouth submerged under a small amount of water.

He said there were no witnesses to the accident.

The young woman suffered chest injuries but no obvious head injuries.

It appeared the woman was wearing a helmet at the time of the crash but it may not have been correctly fastened, as it was found some distance from her body.

Her scooter ended up in an adjacent field, with its engine still running.

She was taken to the nearby Canggu Medical Clinic.
