Chuck Berry, rock 'n' roll legend, mourned by the world
Rock'n'roll legend Chuck Berry died on Saturday at the age of 90. In the hours following his death, musicians, celebrities, and loving fans shared tributes to and memories of the man who pioneered a genre. With hits like “Johnny B. Goode” and "Roll Over Beethoven," Berry defined the sound and style of rock'n'roll in its earliest stage in the 1950s. Twitter users dredged up particularly memorable moments in his long career—like when Berry played with the Beatles on the Mike Douglas Show in 1972—remembered his signature dance moves, and remarked on his singular impact on modern music.
