"People kept asking me, aren't you nervous about playingÂ 11:30?," she explained, revealing that it actually had nothing to do with Beyonce at all, butÂ rather, her excitement for the gig. "No way man, because that means I'm playing for the heavyweights at Coachella." What GagaÂ Â do, though, was include her Beyonce collaboration "Telephone" and seemed to have no problem includingÂ Queen B's verses. She didn't say or do anything regardingÂ Beyonce beyond that, but frankly her hits-stacked set list (and stage-ruling prowess)Â was all that really mattered at the show. Although Gaga didn't opt for the Coachella-esqueÂ surprise guest appearances for her performance, she did manage to give fans a little something unexpected: A brand new single.

The song is now available on iTunes, but what festival goers will likely be putting on repeat is footage of the stripped downÂ medley Gaga performed of "Edge of Glory," "Speechless" and "You &Â I"Â performedÂ toward the end of the night.

Lady Gaga performs on the Coachella Stage during day 2 of the Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival (Weekend 1) at the Empire Polo Club on April 15, 2017 in Indio, Calif.

When filling a festival slot that was initially held by the one and only Beyonce, there's a lot to live up to. But when it's Lady Gaga filling that slot, there's plenty she couldÂ do to fill those giant shoes -- and she most certainly did, new single and all.
