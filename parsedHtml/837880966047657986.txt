NFL Combine 2017 Results: Tracking 40 Times, Bench Press and All Drills
The 2017 NFL Scouting Combine is taking place at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis through Monday. The annual showcase of draft-eligible prospects from around the country is the last chance for players to bolster their stock while going head-to-head against a lot of their fellow draftees. After the combine, prospects will only have a few opportunities left‚Äîpro days and individual workouts with interested teams‚Äîto impress front offices before the draft. The marquee event of the offseason will take center stage starting April 27 in Philadelphia. Let's check out all of the testing results from the on-field work in Indy. Each day's numbers are followed by a recap of the most notable storylines. All of the information will be updated through the conclusion of the combine Monday afternoon.  The class' top running backs‚ÄîDalvin Cook (Florida State), Leonard Fournette (LSU) and Christian McCaffrey (Stanford)‚Äîentered the spotlight during the combine's first day of real action. Any front offices hoping their trip to Indianapolis would provide a definitive answer about which one is the best long-term option didn't get their wish, though. All three performed well in the testing, most notably posting nearly identical times in the 40-yard dash. As Booger McFarland of the SEC Network pointed out, however, the LSU standout kept pace with Cook despite carrying a much larger frame: Cook 4.5. Fournette 4.51. And weighs 20 pounds more.  Now twitter can go back to originally scheduled tweets üòè ESPN Stats and Info discussed exactly how rare Fournette's combination of size and speed is in the combine's marquee event: Leonard Fournette officially ran the 40-yard dash in 4.51 seconds, the fastest time by a RB weighing 240+ lbs since 2006. #NFLCombine https://t.co/hBDIEYKDOM Meanwhile, Charley Casserly of NFL.com provided the results of an informal poll he conducted with more than half the league's teams about the top two running backs: Surveyed 18 teams. Fournette 11. Cook 7 for best back @nflnetwork McCaffrey was perhaps college football's most well-rounded playmaker during his time at Stanford. He made an impact on the ground, through the air and on special teams. He's spent the offseason trying to show teams that his multifaceted skill set is worth a first-round pick. Bleacher Report's Matt Miller came away impressed: Today is showing that Christian McCaffrey is one hell of an athlete. Texas running back D'Onta Foreman was a notable absence from the proceedings after getting scratched from the¬†workout due to a foot injury. Adam Caplan of ESPN reported the rusher has a "small stress fracture in his foot." Max Meyer of NFL.com noted Foreman should still be an active participant at the Longhorns' pro day on March 28. Elsewhere, the future position of Alabama offensive lineman Cam Robinson has been a major talking point leading up to the draft. His draft stock will be a lot higher if he's able to convince teams he'll be able to handle left tackle compared to right tackle or guard. His combine workout was a step in the right direction. Alabama Football showcased the Crimson Tide star in the 40-yard dash: Check out Cam's 40 from this morning at the #NFLCombine #RollTide https://t.co/zU9DtL6rhh Dion Caputi‚Äè of National Football Post liked the lineman's footwork: Mirror drill is where I look for an indicator of pass-pro footwork. #Bama's Cam Robinson was just so smooth and in control at all times. Dan Schneier‚Äè of 247Sports relayed thoughts from former New York Giants center and current NFL Network analyst Shaun O'Hara: Shaun O'Hara on @nflnetwork "I don't see how he (Cam Robinson) is not first tackle off the board." #Giants met with Cam at the Combine. Ultimately, the title of best offensive tackle in the draft is still up for grabs among Robinson, Wisconsin's Ryan Ramczyk and Utah's Garett Bolles, who also put together a strong workout. But the Alabama stalwart has done well to alleviate some lingering concerns during the draft process.    Like the new article format? Send us feedback ! Where can I comment?
