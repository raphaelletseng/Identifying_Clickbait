The Best Colorway of Every Air Jordan


Air Jordan colorways come in every variety imaginable. While the line focused mostly on Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls colors early on, it has since expanded to pull inspiration from a huge range of sources. Whether it’s a shoe based on an ad campaign with Bugs Bunny, a memorable off-court moment from MJ, or even a lifestyle look, they each help tell the story of the player and brand (with varying degrees of success).

We’ve gone through the entire line and chosen the best look for each individual Air Jordan. Check out our picks and let us know your favorites in the comments.
