NASA Releases A View Of How Carbon Dioxide Is Moving Over The Earth And You're Going To Be Scared Carbon dioxide is choking our planet’s atmosphere and the NASA has some eye-opening evidence. NASA revealed a 3D visualisation of the swirling patterns of carbon dioxide as it travels around the world. The simulation shows the movement of carbon in the atmosphere from September 2014 to September 2015. It also shows the complex patterns of both increasing and decreasing of CO2 concentrations on earth. Scientists are making this understand the processes that control how much-emitted carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere and how long it stays there. What is bothering them however is which ecosystems, especially on land, are absorbing what amounts of carbon dioxide?
