Debt-Free RNC Raised $6 Million More Than 2012 In Final Weeks of Campaign Season - Breitbart
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER The Republican National Committee holds zero debt, after it raised millions in the just-over-a-month surrounding the final days of the 2016 election. In fact, the RNC held six times more cash on hand at the end of November as in the same time period in 2012. FOR OUR NEWSLETTER From October 20 to November 28 the RNC raised $36.6 million, $6 million more than the same period in 2012 when Mitt Romney was the Republican presidential nominee. Romney ultimately lost to President Barack Obama in Obama’s bid for re-election. The RNC also boasted 2016 election period ending cash on hand six times the total in 2012, $21.4 million. 91 percent of the donations came in at under $200. The average donation from October 20 to November 28 was $64.56. Over the course of the 2015-2016 election season the RNC raised a total $318.8 million used to support now president-elect Donald J. Trump and candidates on down the ballot, the Thursday announcement detailed. “Our supporters’ generosity on behalf of President-elect Donald Trump helped win the White House, and that enthusiasm has also carried over past Election Day to power a robust post-election fundraising effort,” said RNC Co-Chair Sharon Day upon announcement of the fundraising numbers. Day highlighted the RNC’s active ground game that covered 13 battleground states with “7,600 staff and trained organizers working to elect Donald Trump president and Republicans up and down the ballot.” She continued, “While we join Republicans everywhere in celebrating victories at all levels, the RNC has its eyes set on the future, and we will continue to leverage our resources toward making sure Republicans keep winning wherever they are on the ballot.” Day praised RNC chairman Reince Priebus for “strategic direction” and “skillful management” of RNC assets that resulted in no debt after the hard-fought 2016 election cycle. Priebus has been named President-elect Trump’s Chief of Staff. @MichelleDiana
