Trump thinks something terrible happened in Sweden, so here come the IKEA and ABBA jokes
President Donald Trump has unintentionally turned the internet into one big celebration of Swedish pop culture. The U.S. president on Saturday alluded to a terrorist-related event in Sweden that, as far as Swedes can tell, didn't actually happen. SEE ALSO: Internet turns to @Sweden on Twitter after Trump appears to invent terror attack "Weâ€™ve got to keep our country safe," he said Saturday during a campaign-style rally in Melbourne, Florida. Trump was defending his now-suspended travel ban and criticizing Europe's refugee policies. "You look at whatâ€™s happening in Germany, you look at whatâ€™s happening last night in Sweden," Trump said. "Sweden, who would believe this?" Twitter, as it does, responded with a wave of references to IKEA, meatballs, the character Swedish Chef, infectious '70s pop group ABBA and Swedish creation Uncovered: the plans for the terrorist attack in #Sweden last night.

President Donald Trump has unintentionally turned the internet into one big celebration of Swedish pop culture.

The U.S. president on Saturday alluded to a terrorist-related event in Sweden that, as far as Swedes can tell, didn't actually happen.

"Weâ€™ve got to keep our country safe," he said Saturday during a campaign-style rally in Melbourne, Florida. Trump was defending his now-suspended travel ban and criticizing Europe's refugee policies.

"You look at whatâ€™s happening in Germany, you look at whatâ€™s happening last night in Sweden," Trump said. "Sweden, who would believe this?"

Twitter, as it does, responded with a wave of references to IKEA, meatballs, the Muppets character Swedish Chef, infectious '70s pop group ABBA and Swedish creation The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.Â
