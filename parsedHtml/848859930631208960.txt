Faith and Identity Clash in ‘The Profane’: An Actors’ Round Table
Faith and Identity Clash in ‘The Profane’: An Actors’ Round Table
Sam and Emina are two American kids attending college upstate. They meet. They fall in love. They get engaged. It’s a familiar story, but then again it isn’t. In Zayd Dohrn’s “The Profane,” which opens on April 9 at Playwrights Horizons , Sam (Babak Tafti) and Emina (Tala Ashe) are first-generation Americans, the children of Middle Eastern immigrants. While Emina’s liberal West Village family has put aside the Muslim faith, Sam’s conservative White Plains clan practices it devoutly. Who can talk about D.J.s and place settings when clashes about freedom and fundamentalism loom? The cast of “The Profane,” which includes the playwright Heather Raffo as Emina’s mother, are all American citizens and all of Middle Eastern or North African descent. For them, the play’s concerns echo offstage, too. As a travel ban is threatened, this play about assimilation and the different ways of being American has come to feel very personal. On a recent afternoon before rehearsal, cast members, who also include Lanna Joffrey and Ramsey Faragallah as Sam’s parents, and Francis Benhamou as Emina’s sister, sat in a lobby at Playwright Horizons, at a table littered with coffee cups, water bottles and tangerines, and spoke about identity, the roles they won’t play and how a Sally Field movie scarred them. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. It really spoke to me, being first-generation American. It had a lot of themes in there that I have known myself. The constant battle with being an other and stuff like that even within your own Middle Eastern group. Advertisement I was interested in the premise, especially right now. These two immigrant families have assimilated in very different ways. Growing up as an Iranian-American, I looked around and I saw, even in Ohio, a lot of different Iranians. Zayd, the playwright, did say that he wrote this play very much exploring what it is to be American. He wanted to show families that consider themselves American but are completely different. That’s a huge question right now. Who’s American? Who should be here? It put extra pressure on us. And then we got pressure from our communities as well. We feel a huge pressure to get it right and be together in our rightness. Advertisement It’s pretty cool that a guy wants to write about an Arab family instead of writing another white story. Advertisement We’ve had two talkbacks so far. There are questions about whether Emina should be wearing a hijab if she’s found the Muslim faith. There are these preconceived notions that people have about the Muslim religion — that they all wear hijabs, that they’re all one way. There’s just as much of a spectrum as there is with Judaism and Christianity. Advertisement I feel an enormous pressure to sensitively and accurately portray Middle Eastern characters. I’m not Muslim, I don’t know any more about Islam than what I’ve read in a book. A lot of times you’re brought into the room and sort of expected to represent something that you don’t. That challenge and that pressure manifest in many ways. Advertisement Before 9/11, if you were brown, you were basically just a cabdriver or a punch line. Somebody was going to pour soup on you. And then, with all the horrors of 9/11, things slowly started to change. You’re telling some stories about real people. Other times, you’re like, “Well, gosh, if I do this one terrible job, I could make a living for a year.” We have to make those choices as artists, and those are hard choices to make. I’m kind of a mutt. My family is from everywhere. I’ve always been other no matter where I am. I get cast in a lot of ethnicities. I’m actually Jewish. I love the opportunity to always be the other, because I can relate to that, that’s how I grew up. Advertisement We don’t have a lot of plays about Islam coming out. We have Ayad Akhtar , and that’s about it, right? So the pressures of trying to tell this story fall upon a production that can’t necessarily support it, because it’s talking about one nuance. You can’t say that’s it. There’s so much work out there. Something I’m responding to in the piece is how different the children are from the parents. Because my father’s experience was to become completely involved in an American lifestyle. He told me once, ‘You’re more Iraqi than I am.’ There were decades of my life completely dedicated to being an Iraqi-American, and I really think that’s super resonant to where Emina’s going. Advertisement I was born in Iran, came over to Ohio with my parents. And my parents are aggressively liberal. They’ve been almost too supportive of this crazy thing I’ve decided to do. In Ohio and even at Boston University, where I got my B.F.A., I didn’t have a sense of otherness. It wasn’t until I came to New York and saw the things I was submitted for like, oh, they want to put me into this category, into a head scarf. I didn’t see any brown people in television or movies, but it didn’t matter. I honestly didn’t even realize that I was an Arab. I grew up in Southern California — surfing, skateboarding, illegal drag racing. When I came here, if I wanted to go out on auditions, they were like, ‘You’re a Pakistani cabdriver.’ And I’m not! Advertisement The movie “Not Without My Daughter,” starring Sally Field haunted generations of Iranians. Oh yeah. It scarred us. “Not Without My Daughter” was so painful because it just made all Iranians seem terrible and evil. They all sit around on Persian rugs.

An article on Page 6 this weekend about the play “The Profane” misidentifies the cast member who comments on the fact that the author and the director of the play are both white. It is Francis — not Tala Ashe — who says, “It’s pretty cool that a guy wants to write about an Arab family instead of writing another white story.” A version of this article appears in print on April 2, 2017, on Page AR6 of the with the headline: Faith, Freedom and Family.
