A gunman has opened fire on an Istanbul mosque just hours after a gunman stormed a nightclub in the city during New Year celebrations and killed 39 people.

Two people have been taken to hospital following the shooting at the Hasan Pasha Mosque in Algeria mosque in the north of the Turkish city.

A further 69 people are thought to have been wounded in the attack, which happened in the early hours of this morning.

The mosque shooting came this afternoon as people gathered at the mosque for prayers when an gunman opened fire with a rifle.

Police have launched an investigation but authorities say there is no reason to believe there was a 'political cause'.

It has been suggested that the incident might be linked to a row between a father and son.

It is not clear whether the shooting at the mosque and the massacre at the nightclub are linked but shows the heightened sense of security in cities around the world.

It also is unclear who carried out the shooting at the nightclub, however recent terror attacks in Turkey have been carried out by groups such as ISIS and Kurdish militants.

The gunman, pictured, was described as raining down 'a hail of bullets' on the New Year revellers and is still on the run

Already people in the city have started burying the dead from the nightclub shooting, just 13 hours after the attack as per Muslim tradition which dictates people should be buried as soon as possible after their death.

And Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim has revealed that the gunman left his weapon inside the venue and escaped by 'taking advantage of the chaos' that ensued.

But he also said there was no truth to reports that the attacker wore a Santa Claus costume, despite the CCTV footage from inside the club and also shouted 'Allahu Akbar'.

Fifteen of the casualties are believed to be foreign nationals, including one Israeli woman and people from Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Lebanon and Libya.
