Unless you've been living under a rock, everyone knows that 2016 has been the hottest of absolute hot trash. That said? There've been a handful of people who actually have a pretty decent 2016‚Äîwho are Donald Trump‚Äîwho collectively, we can genuinely be happy for. In no particular order, they are: 1. Gucci Mane The Atlanta rapper and East Atlanta Santa got out of jail this year looking great‚Äîif not different enough to inspire a conspiracy theory that he was a clone . He got his life together, dropped some new songs, and celebrated an engagement to long-time girlfriend Keyisha Kaoir at an Atlanta Hawks game. As Guwop himself would put it: , indeed.

Leonardo DiCaprio We were all pulling for you, and you won. Congrats, buddy. That long-awaited Oscar is finally yours. Last night‚Äôs win at the #Oscars was an incredible honor ‚Äì but it was also an important opportunity to bring even more attention to #climatechange. Last year was the hottest in recorded history. Climate change is real, it is the most dire crisis our species has ever known, and it is happening right now. We must empower leaders who don‚Äôt speak for corporate interests but who speak for us, our children‚Äôs children and those whose voices cannot be heard.

They said u lost a step, wasn't explosive as once was, the best days was in the real view, questioned your drive, your leadership, your commitment, you don't have killer instinct, going back home is the worst mistake in your career, he got the coach fired, players traded, won't work between him and Kyrie, Him and Kev won't work, love your teammates to much, there's no way he can deliver a championship in his hometown, etc etc etc....

6. James Corden

It's true: Sometimes, The Late Late Show host is the host you most want to hate, but he's made it a monumental task, after all the amazing carpool karaoke videos he's gifted us with. Among the names he's wrangled: Mariah Carey, Madonna, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, FLOTUS & Missy Elliot, Adele, One Direction, Sia, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, the one and only Bruno Mars (and more!):

Corden also found a final jolt of relevance in 2016 when, in the wake of George Michael's recent passing, the very first Carpool Karaoke clip‚Äîfeaturing George Michael‚Äîresurfaced for all to love.

7. Lin Manuel-Miranda

The hottest ticket in town, dreamed up by a Puerto Rican kid from Washington Heights with a vision: To create one of the most revolutionary musicals of all time. He did, winning a Tony and a Pulitzer in the process.

Queen Bey came back with a vengeance in 2016, slaying all the people of the land with her sixth studio album Lemonade, to say nothing of the collective frenzy she put everyone in when she dropped that 10-second HBO promo on Instagram:
