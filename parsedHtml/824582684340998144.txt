Never Be Like You dominated the charts in 2016 after its release in January and was number one on the ARIA singles chart.

Flume charted three other times throughout the countdown with his songs Lose It featuring Vic Mensa at #95, Smoke and Retribution featuring Vince Staples and Kucka at #37 and Say It at #8.

Speaking to triple j, Flume — whose real name is Harley Streten — said the win was "surreal".

"I'm incredibly grateful, it's been a huge year. I honestly couldn't be happier," he said.

"Thank you everyone who voted, thank you everyone in this room right now — this is crazy."

This year's countdown drew in a total of 2,255,110 votes, the largest amount ever received.

Triple j Unearthed artist Tash Sultana charted twice with Notion at #32 and Jungle at #3.

The 21-year-old Melbourne musician was named the Unearthed Artist of the Year and was one of a record 66 Australian artists to make it into the 2016 countdown.

Australian hip hop group Hilltop Hoods took out the fourth spot with their song 1955, making it the sixth time the group made it into the top 10.

Indigenous rappers AB Original claimed the number 16 spot for their anthem titled January 26 which calls for the Australia Day date to be changed.

The duo also charted at number 45 for their cover of Dumb Things featuring the song's original artist, Paul Kelly.
