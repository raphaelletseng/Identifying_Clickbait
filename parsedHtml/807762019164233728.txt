India v England, fourth Test: day four – as it happened

(the first half) and (the rest)                                                                                   Post-amble There were actually some moments of close, competitive cricket between those two sides today, in the partnerships between Root and Bairstow, and, briefly, Bairstow and Stokes, but the fact remains that England are on course for another heavy defeat, still requiring 49 to make India bat again. The imperious Kohli and false 9 Jayant rubbed salt in the wounds in style in the first part of the day before the home side’s always-dominant spinners did their thing once again, bolstered by a seamer striking to dismiss a first-innings centurion in his first over. Root and Bairstow batted well but it wasn’t enough, isn’t enough. India will be 3-0 up before most of our UK-based OBO readers will have woken up tomorrow. Thanks for your company and emails, and Andrew Benton gets to play us out with this gloomy missive: “Could this be the end of England as we know it? Bangladesh was billed as a warm up tour, and the excellent preparation of making a mess there has clearly paid dividends in the resulting drubbing in India. Now would be a good time for Cook to retire as captain, still relatively on a high given the unbelievable India performance, and he’d have masses of respect if he did so.” This will, one suspects, be the dominant talking point of the coming days. In the meantime here’s our on-the-whistle match report. Stay on the site for much more. Bye, and enjoy the rest of your weekend.      Wicket! (and stumps): Ball c Patel b Ashwin 2, England 182-6 Ashwin comes round the wicket at Ball, and finds some spitting turn outside off-stump, then rounds off the day with the dismissal of Ball, who just edges another swift top-spinner behind. An appropriately triumphant end to the day for a rampant India. Updated       Jadeja bowls what England want to be the last over of the day, but it isn’t. Ball is on strike, but again plays with orthodox defensive correctness until he’s frozen in the headlights by a sharply turning leg-break. The batsmen try to waste time as best they can, the bowler tries to rush it through with a similar sense of purpose. Ball takes a single off the last ball of the over.      Ashwin tries out his full repertoire on Ball, with close catchers in either side of the wicket, but the nightwatchman, who batted so well in the first innings, manages to play out before getting off the mark with a technically adept push for a single.      Jadeja tests Bairstow with a fuller, quicker ball that he edges along the ground to slip, in a tight maiden over. The horns are honking again, there’s an exuberant buzz about the ground, and India’s fans know the series is in the bag. Updated       Bairstow completes a rugged and resilient half-century with a flick off his legs for a single from Ashwin. It’s been a bold display after a bracing start, but this potentially handy partnership goes no further: after reverse-sweeping onto his boot and being taken at second slip. It’s reviwed but it’s the right decision. Ball, in as nightwatchman, has to fend off a menacing carom ball straight up but survives the over. Updated       Wicket! Stokes c Vijay b Ashwin 18, England 180-5 Stokes is gone. The umpires check whether Stokes connected with his reverse sweep shot. It did. He swept it onto his boot, it cannoned up into the air and was taken at slip by Vijay. Good decision. Updated       A change of ends for Jadeja too now, Bairstow picking up a well-run two off his first ball with a flick square on the legside. Jadeja has an energetic lbw shout when Stokes pushes forward, prods, misses and is hit on the back pad. But the umpire’s unmoved. Amid all the doom, gloom and harrumphing, everyone’s pal, Rob Smyth, has a sunnier outlook: “Has a team ever played better while being thrashed than England in this series?” he chirps, his pint half-full. “It’s probably going to end up as a noble 4-0 defeat.” Not sure whether it’s been a great performance as a team, but there have been a greater collection of encouraging individual performances than one might normally expect in your common-or-garden drubbing.      Stokes is on to anything short, and he cracks Ashwin away again on the offside for a single. Bairstow plays late off another shorter ball, pushing it to leg for one more. A fuller, sharply turning ball vexes Stokes a touch, the batsman driving and missing. Looks like people won’t be getting that shopping/self-discovery day in Mumbai tomorrow after all. At least not initially.      Jayant finds some extravagant turn outside off-stump but it’s short enough for Stokes to read. He and Bairstow swap ends twice with swift singles before Stokes misjudges a reverse sweep attempt, which bounces up off his forearm and over Kohli. He gets one for it, and two more follow with a rather more accomplished shot from Bairstow. These two are motoring along nicely, in between the scares and appeals.      An awry umpiring decision is again overturned, after Bairstow prods at Ashwin, the ball dobs up and is taken by a diving forward short leg. Umpire Oxenford’s finger goes up, Bairstow swiftly reviews and is vindicated. He hadn’t come close to hitting it. A two and two ones follow. Updated       Bairstow sweeps hard at Jayant but it’s well cut off at the square leg boundary and they only take one. Bairstow then hammers a short ball off the back foot in front of square on the offside for four, following it with a slog-sweep for SIX. “That could be a maximum … it is,” hollers Nasser Hussain in the commentary box. <Sigh>. A six is NOT a “maximum”. “I have a cunning plan,” whispers Chris Drew, “The ginger ninjas put on a 200 partnership, then Jos comes in and scores a rapid century, setting up the declaration just before tea tomorrow. Adil makes amends by ‘doing a Monty’ and England win by 40 odd runs I’ll go for a lie-down now.” Yes, do.      Jadeja’s 15-over spell is ended, with Ashwin switching ends and coming on in his stead as the shadows lengthen over the outfield, almost reaching the square. The world’s No1 spinner is over the wicket at Bairstow, who makes an inelegant mess of a reverse-sweep attempt, completely missing – Patel fumbles the take too behind the stumps. He then adds a single with a legside flick. Ashwin duly switches to round the wicket at Stokes, and teases him again with his fuller flighted delivery, which the left-hander tends to prod tentatively at. But he sees out the over.      Bairstow gets away with it again, as a very uncertain attempted pull, feet splayed and deceived by bounce and spin, dobs up and just beyond short leg. He adds a single in rather more orthodox fashion before another no-ball for overstepping. Stokes wants to be assertive, as per, and picks up four, rocking back and cracking a short ball to the wide long-on boundary.      Jadeja thinks he’s got Bairstow with another ripper that Bairstow looks to have edged behind, but the batsman survives on DRS because Jadeja’s overstepped, and Bairstow didn’t feather it after all. He then adds a single, Stokes gets off the mark straight away with another, and England have to steady themselves again here.      Review! Bairstow c Patel b Jadeja? The ball he’d long threatened with – has Jadeja got his man at last? NO HE HASN’T. Because DRS shows he’s overstepped: no ball. Updated       Jayant continues. Root turns him round the corner for one. Bairstow hoiks him likewise towards the man at deep square leg and gets one more. But Jayant looks a bit more threatening in this over, , denying Root a hundred once more and deceiving him with a quicker ball, pinning him in front. It was an excellent knock from the vice-captain but England needed more, and that might be it.      Wicket! Root lbw b Jayant 77, England 141-4 As feared: Jayant pushes one through a bit quicker, it comes back in at Root, hits him low on the pad and he walks immediately.      When commentators start trumpeting England’s position – the two dropped chances they’ve survived, the failed reviews, the handy partnership etc – then their fans start to worry. On Root and Bairstow plod though, but the latter is made to look awkward by a Jadeja ball that turns sharply (again), brushes thigh and loops to slip, prompting an unconvincing, and doomed, appeal.      Jayant’s not pushing it though as quickly as the other two spinners but still manages to concede four byes when a slightly wayward ball is missed by both batsman and keeper. Bairstow then picks up four with an enjoyably emphatic pull. Two more singles follow. In injury news that doesn’t concern England for a change, Shami and Saha are definitely out of the next Test. And they’ll have a drink.      Singles each for Bairstow and Root as Jadeja continues, before Bairstow plays a fine textbook cover drive that deserved four but brings only two. “In regard to your request for places to go shopping in Mumbai on Monday if England fail to see out Day 4 of the Mumbai Test,” writes Raymond Reardon, resuming a line of correspondence that had dried up during this partnership, “may I recommend that the England team members spend the day shopping at www.crickstore.com situated in Kondival, Mumbai and also they could make some purchases from the Deonar Abittoir to fill their cricket boxes.” Why all this consumerism? Aren’t middle-class English people supposed to go all hippy, shun material items and discover themselves on trips to India? And the same goes for mere fans.      A change of bowling, but it’s spin for spin, batting hero Jayant coming on. He’s round the wicket and slower than Ashwin, and almost gets his man straight away, appealing for a catch at forward short leg. Umpire Erasmus is having none of it though, and India spend so much time deliberating that they run out of time to review. Which is just as well as it hadn’t hit the bat. Root picks up four – and his 1,000th run against India – by pulling a short ball backward of square to the boundary. An eventful over ends with another appeal, this one for lbw, and this one reviewed. It turned a fraction back into the batsman and looked good for line but was going over the top.      Jadeja sends his trademark sharp turner past Bairstow’s stranded bat, but the Yorkshireman responds with a well played late cut for a single. Two more singles keep the strike rotating, before an astutely judged square cut gives Root two more. England are rattling along at almost four an over here, which is an achievement of sorts, and almost certainly the only approach to take.      Bairstow cuts a shorter ball in front of square for a single off Ashwin, who continues to come in from round the wicket. Root plays a rasher shot, missing a sweep that loops up off his pad just over the man at short leg. It’s good pressure from Ashwin though, although Bairstow responds well with a neat late flick for a single. Another risky shot follows – a reverse sweep from Root – which bounces before reaching the man at backward point.      The 21st consecutive over of spin: Bairstow pushes Jadeja off the back foot towards mid-on for a single, and Root adds another. This is good strike rotation from England as the ones continue. A minor-key triumph for Root is that Jadeja no longer has any close catchers in front of the wicket in for him.      Intelligent from Bairstow, who scoffs at Root’s request for a quick single and sends him back. But Ashwin’s looking a lot more dangerous from round the wicket and even the well-set Root misreads a couple. A maiden.      The hundred comes up with a nudge round the corner from Bairstow, but Jadeja continues to menace, beating Root’s forward prod with another ripper. Root responds with yet another front-foot sweep: once more, it’s four. And he keeps the strike with a single off the last ball.      Root pulls a shorter Ashwin ball in front of square on the legside for one. The bowler then changes tack, going round the wicket at Bairstow, and he should have been rewarded for it, as Bairstow’s rash reverse sweep is by the sainted holy Kohli at slip. This new angle of attack has asked new questions of Bairstow but he sees it out and then takes a quick single with an on-drive that brings up the kind of quick 50 partnership that looked utterly beyond England at tea.      Bairstow’s looking more confident in going forward to Jadeja now, but it’s in going back, square cutting a shorter ball off the back foot, that he gets a bottom-edged four. Two slips and a silly point stay in place, and Bairstow takes a risk with an uppish drive off a more flighted delivery that just falls short of mid-off. This is a good contest at the moment.      Bairstow sweeps emphatically at Ashwin and picks up one, rather than four, thanks to Nair’s fine fielding in the deep. Root then brings up a really very accomplished 50 with a bold reverse sweep. That said, if he doesn’t convert this, England are even more doomed than they already are. He continues to attack though, and gets forward to drive through the offside for four more before a slightly more tenative prod round the corner brings a single. Bairstow then rounds off an expensive over with a sweep for another one. Updated       Bairstow, showing signs of settling (dare I say it?), clips Jadeja neatly away on the legside and gets three as it’s just about cut off on the boundary before Root plays his trademark shot of this innings – an assertive front-foot sweep in front of square – and gets four more.      I shouldn’t have said Bairstow looked more comfortable against Ashwin than Jadeja, as he’s almost bowled shouldering arms at one that bounces back in at his raised glove and nearly bounces onto the stumps. A swept single follows before an umpire’s referral for a stumping against Root, but he’s kept his back foot grounded. Root then rocks back and plays a well judged square cut for two. Well read.      Bairstow pushes a shorter Jadeja ball square on the legside for a single, before it’s Root’s turn to be bamboozled by the left-armer, who rips two consecutive leg-breaks sharply past his outside edge. Too good for the batsmen and, at times, the keeper, this stuff. Some commentary box chatter about how much better England were here four years ago with Swann and Panesar in the lineup, though that rather ignores how India have evolved into a much tighter, more focused Test-match side in the same period. Updated       Root takes a single, giving Bairstow a chance to acclimatise himself against Ashwin, a task for which he looks slightly more comfortable, neatly clipping a single away on the legside. Two from the over. Even the stats nerds are trying to jinx England: England's two not-out batsmen, Root and Bairstow, have scored more than 2,700 runs between them in Tests this calendar year #IndvsEng      Jadeja mercilessly teases Bairstow with two more beauties, jagged away past an outstretched bat, prompting Bairstow to then take a risk with an uppish drive that bounces just agonisingly short of the fielder at extra-cover. He survives the over though. Which is about all he can do at the moment.      A missed half-chance for Patel? Bairstow bottom edges off his glove and the keeper can’t grab it, but India can afford to be sanguine about missed half-chances, while England will have sleepless nights about theirs. He adds a single before Root sweeps aggressively again, hoiking towards deep midwicket for four. Given the persistent men around the bat that’s intelligent as well as assertive cricket from Root. “Cook should have stood down in 2014 after the 5-0 farce down under,” thunders Dave Adams. “He only survived then due to the paucity of alternatives and his own refusal to do the decent thing. Nearly three years on, I don’t see a viable captain in the current squad, unless we want to ruin our best batsman. That’s a terrible reason to persist with the status quo though. Cook looks like he’s had enough - needs to be put out of his misery, much like England in this match.” Overlooking a decent period of refreshed positive cricket in summer 2015 and early 2016 there, Dave. Now, mind, they do look tired in every sense. Updated       A single and four more byes as Jadeja continues to tease, torment and tantalise, and Bairstow finally gets off the mark, again driving perilously uppishly, at a turning ball on the offside. Root looks rather more settled and sweeps emphatically across the line for four, but he read it well.      Root meets Ashwin on the full again and bunts towards mid-off for a single, then Bairstow flirts with, nay snogs passionately, danger as he dabs defensively into his own thigh and it comes agonisingly close to bouncing back onto the stumps. He then misses completely one that bounces back in at him, as does Patel behind the stumps, and it’s four byes. Ashwin utterly on top of the new batsman here.      Can England’s right-handers dig them out of this somehow, now the lefties have gone? Jadeja, who’s bowled at least as well as Ashwin in this match, continues to find challenging turn and accuracy, as well as that crucial pace, and Bairstow’s first four deliveries consist of three play-and-misses and one defensive shot. They’re all dots, natch.      The players are on their way back out for the next episode of this 1993 tribute match.      Some teatime musings: is this the longest sequence of consecutive Tests against Asian opposition England have had? By the end of this series, it will be 14, starting with Sri Lanka back at the start of the English summer. Alarmingly, the standard of performance has been on a downward trajectory, although facing India in Mumbai in December is a very different kettle of coconuts from Sri Lanka in Durham in May. On that theme, Chris Bates writes in from inside the Wankhede Stadium: “It was a great knock by Kohli. Some wags amongst the England fans have been sending texts to some sponsor’s app which appear on the big screen. Best so far was probably ‘Kohli may be one of the best batsman of all time but could he do it on a cold Tuesday night in Stoke. Tony Pulis.’ Having fun despite the carnage.”      And that's tea: England 49-3 “I bet Moeen goes early,” I just mused to myself. And he does, slightly misjudging the bounce and nudging behind to Vijay at leg-slip. It brings the session to a close, as tea is called. This one will be over today now. “I saw a feature recently which worked out the most important wicket ever in test cricket in terms of consequences,” writes Peter Salmon. “Rashid might be a chance for most important drop, as obviously Cook will now resign, Root get the captaincy too early and see his career fall to pieces, followed by Stokes as captain for an Ashes hammering, and England down to sixth in the rankings? Can’t see another scenario at this point.” On that cheery thought, I’ll nip out for a coffee. See you in a bit.      Wicket! Moeen c Vijay b Jadeja 0, England 49-3 And another! Mooen tentatively prods Jadeja round the corner, Vijay dives low to his right and claims a fine catch.      Root continues to play with assertive intent: he gets forward and flicks Ashwin down to fine leg for two but then faces an appeal for a catch after one loops up to the keeper off his pads. , but there’s nothing remotely like an inside-edge, and not much of an lbw shout either, and the batsman survives. He celebrates the reprieve by driving a fuller delivery before it bounces through the covers for four.      A nice, spin-smothering clip from Cook off Jadeja brings him a classy four. But then he’s gone! Flummoxed by the left-armer again, who drags him across his stumps, pins him in front with a quicker ball and claims him as his 100th Test scalp, and prompts a noisy crowd to chant his name and honk horns. “A mention of the Bombay Stores in the 7th over,” writes t John Starbuck, “leads me to recommend the Bradford version www.bombaystores.co.uk where you can buy lots of colourful clothing gifts for the women and men in your life. Everything’s turning Indian now.” This match and series certainly has now, for good.      Wicket! Cook lbw b Jadeja 18, England 43-2 Is Cook out lbw here? Yes he is. He misses one that’s speared into him. The finger goes up, Cook sends it upstairs, but Spin vision and ball-tracking confirm he’s a goner. Updated       Root and Cook take a single each off Ashwin. Then … a big appeal, as Ashwin brings one in sharply at Root and it bounces off his pad into the arms of short leg but it had missed his bat by a fair bit. He then pulls a shorter ball firmly for one, and Cook completes another to keep the scoreboard ticking over in vain pursuit of safety/dignity.
