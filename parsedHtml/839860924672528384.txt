India Now Ranks 97th In The World With An Average Internet Speed Of 5.6 Mbps The rise in people having a minimum connection speed of at least 4 Mbps has risen by 123% in India year-on-year and 28% over the last Q3 2016 quarter. While this is good, our country still has a very long way in terms of getting our Internet connectivity standards up to global standards. The global average Internet connectivity speed is 7 Mbps, according to the Akamai report. South Korea leads the APAC countries with the highest average Internet speed of 26.1 Mbps, and Philippines is the lowest at 4.5 Mbps.

Signs are encouraging about the State Of The Internet in India. From 105th position and 4.1 Mbps speed till three months ago, the country has risen to 97th position on a global level with 5.6 Mbps of average connectivity speed.

The data comes from Akamai’s State Of The Internet for Q4 2016, and the report’s generally pretty chirpy about how the Internet’s growing around the world, not just in terms of global connectivity speeds but also penetration into rural areas where the Internet didn’t exist before.

Compared to the same period in 2015, India’s connectivity speed has risen by 99% (in terms of IPv4 traffic), and with respect to the last report from Q3 2016 the Internet speed in India has risen by 36%.
