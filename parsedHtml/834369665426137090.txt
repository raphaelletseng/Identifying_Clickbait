Seen This Image Of 'Pregnant' Trump Being Spooned By Vladimir Putin? Hereâ€™s What It Means! This 'Yuge' illustration of a pregnant Donald Trump being lovingly caressed by his 'lover boy' Vladimir Putin, appeared across buildings in New York City on Valentines Day. The image quite obviously went 'bigly' viral. The illustration popped up in three different locations across the city, leaving people baffled and assumed at the same time. #Trump  #Putin image projected on #NYC building on 9th Avenue #Chelsea  pic.twitter.com/Dzt2kSTL2e The hilarious illustration, however, was not an all-out political attack on the presidential power couple. It was an advertising ploy of a dating app called 'Hater'. Make #valentinesday great again. Come hang on 14th and 8th if you're in NYC.

The app is the brainchild ofÂ Goldman Sachs employee-turned-comedian Brendan Alper. "Thereâ€™s a lot of tension out there, regardless of which side youâ€™re on. Weâ€™re just trying to make people laugh. Through humour, hate can turn into love," Alper told . The app with an upside-down heart is not even a month old and is currently the numero uno lifestyle app in Germany. Almost 80 percent of its users in theÂ US and abroad hate Trump to his guts, states the Business Insider report.

This public display of affection between the two leaders isnâ€™t something new. In May last year, a mural on the side of a restaurant in Lithuania of Trump kissing Putin sparked â€˜laughtivismâ€™ and outrage at the same time.

If you want some more clarity on this strange admiration that Trump has for Putin, the host of 'Last Week Tonight', John Oliver breaks it down for you in a hilarious way. In Oliver's words, Trump has been 'objectively nicer to Vladimir Putin than to Meryl Streep.'
