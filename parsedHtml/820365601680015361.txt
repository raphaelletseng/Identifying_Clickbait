Wizkid And Drake Reunite On New Island Banger "Hush Up The Silence"
Wizkid And Drake Reunite On New Island Banger "Hush Up The Silence"
Need an escape from the winter doldrums? Look no further than Wizkid and Drake’s latest collaboration “Hush Up The Silence,” which the dynamic duo dropped on Saturday. As The follow-up to their juggernaut summer earworm “ One Dance ,” Wiz and Drizzy don’t stray too far from the formula that made their collab such a standout. That means more dancehall-infused rhythms and airy tropical beats. Wizkid gets the proceedings underway by unleashing the kind of confident verbiage that’s made him one of music’s most promising young stars. “Starboy, call me number one,” he sings. “When my tune drop, the girls, they bounce along / Me no like nothing come between me and me paper.” When Drizzy finally arrives for the song’s third verse, he does so armed with his trademark island patois, and mournful laments about, what else, drama and jealousy. “Too mixed up in drama to go outside,” Drake coos. “Too mixed up in drama to free my mind / Jealous people around me, I need to change my life / I just turn colder every time I try.” That Drake and Wizkid reteamed on a song should come as no surprise, after “One Dance” spent a whopping 12 straight weeks atop the Billboard 100 . Back in October, the Nigeria-born singer took to Twitter and hinted towards a reunion between the two stars. “6god x Real Starboy about to school everybody,” he tweeted at the time. 6god x Real Starboy about to school everybody!! 🌊🌊🌊🔥🔥🔥 Well here it is, and boy was it ever worth the wait. Listen to “Hush Up The Silence” below.
