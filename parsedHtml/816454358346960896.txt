I hear from battalions of job-seekers who are under the mistaken impression that simply creating a LinkedIn profile will get them a great job. That's false! LinkedIn is like a Swiss army knife. It's an incredible tool, but it doesn't do the work by itself. Here are ten things every job-seeker should be doing on LinkedIn. The biggest personal-branding mistake most job-seekers make is to brand themselves as miscellaneous collections of experiences. When a visitor reads your LinkedIn profile, it is vital to tell them right away what kind of job you are looking for. That's why branding choices like "Multi-Skilled Strategic Leader" are the absolute worst. Bland, general branding like that doesn't tell us what you want to do in your next job. When a job-seeker's LinkedIn Summary says "I'm an experienced problem-solver and leader," we can't tell what kinds of jobs the job-seeker is qualified for. A recruiter or hiring manager will leave that job-seeker's profile page right away and look for someone else to fill a job. You have to brand yourself for the specific jobs you want, not every job you might remotely be qualified for. In your LinkedIn headline (examples: Digital Marketing Specialist; Office Manager with HR and Payroll Experience; CPA Specializing in Start-Up Tech Firms) you need to make it clear what kind of job you want. Your headline establishes the frame -- then your LinkedIn Summary fills in the details! If you don't know what kind of job you want, hiring managers and recruiters cannot help you figure it out! They don't have time, and frankly it's not their job to give you career counseling. You may be qualified for dozens or scores of jobs, but you will not look like an attractive candidate for any of those opportunities until you make the decision "What kind of job do I want?" Pick a set of job titles to focus on in your job hunt and brand yourself for those jobs -- not every job. If you aren't working right now, you can add the words "Seeking New Challenge" or the acronym "ISO" (In Search Of) to your LinkedIn headline. That will tell recruiters and hiring managers you're on the market.    Trending on {{channel_name}}
