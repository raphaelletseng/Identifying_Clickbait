Cow charges at officer in Temple, Texas
Hilarious moment cow charges at officer trying to wrangle it


An officer was hilariously captured attempting to wrangle a runaway cow when the animal decided to do the chasing and charged at the official.

The unlikely police chase occurred between an officer and an unruly cow on Thursday afternoon in Temple, Texas.

Local law enforcement received a call about a heifer on the loose and sent officer Gabriel Estrella on the cow-hunt.

What happened after Estrella spotted the escaped animal was comically captured on his dashboard camera.

The officer tracked down the animal and followed it in his vehicle until he was able to almost successfully corral it into a fenced off area.

When Estrella left his car to close the gates of the fence, he turned around to see the enraged cow charging straight at him.

Terrified, he quickly ran around to the side of the car to safety, seconds before the ornery animal busted through the flimsy fence gate.

The cow had escaped from a nearby veterinary clinic and was last seen heading out of city limits on Thursday night

He said to WFAA: 'I saw that another fence was open so that's why you see me inside the fence because I was going to run across and close the other side but I heard something and saw a cow coming at me so I had to move out of the way.'

Police said the cow escaped from a veterinary clinic around two miles away from the park where Estella attempted to trap the cow, reported KWTX.

As of Thursday night, the cow had made a clean break from the law and was last seen heading outside of the city limits.
