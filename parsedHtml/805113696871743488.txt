'Trumpgrets' is the Tumblr page for Trump supporters who just can't take him anymore
Throughout his campaign, supporters of Donald Trump loyally stood by his in-your-face bombast, from that lewd clip to the blunt insults he threw time and time again . In their eyes, The Donald could do no wrong. Now the " Trumpgrets " Tumblr is bringing to life those #MAGA voters who do have a critical thing or two to say about the President-elect. Some concerns regard equal pay, medicare funding, or the fact that Trump isn't trying to put Hillary Clinton in jail, and even went so far as to call the Clintons "good people." SEE ALSO: Trump‚Äôs America will also be a new golden age of activism It was all just too much for these Trump supporters to take. @realDonaldTrump Sir you need to keep your word to the USA.

Throughout his campaign, supporters of Donald Trump loyally stood by his in-your-face bombast, from that very lewd Access Hollywood clip to the blunt insults he threw time and time again.

In their eyes, The Donald could do no wrong.
