The Texas Rangers locked in one of their key youngsters for the foreseeable future Saturday, as they signed second baseman Rougned Odor to a six-year contract extension.

Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News first reported the two sides were close to a deal. Jon Heyman of FanRag Sports reported negotiations were complete, with Odor set to earn $49.5 million over six years with an option for a seventh.

Joel Sherman of the New York Post confirmed the terms of Odor's extension.

Odor and the Rangers had been in contract negotiations for quite some time, but the 23-year-old Venezuelan initially turned down an offer worth $35 million over six years with two team-option years, according to Heyman.

In 2016, Odor had a .271 batting average, 33 home runs and 88 RBI, and it was easily his best season in the big leagues thus far. But he earned just over $500,000, per Spotrac.
