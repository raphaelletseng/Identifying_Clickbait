Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas told The Washington Post in an email that the host's behaviour was "abhorrent and unacceptable." The company has in recent years faced growing complaints of racial discrimination by its hosts. According to local media reports, Dyne Suh, a law student in Riverside, California, said she and her fiance had been looking forward to a short vacation over Presidents' Day weekend in Big Bear Lake, a popular ski getaway about two hours by car east of Los Angeles. About a month before their trip, Suh booked a mountain cabin on Airbnb listed as a "Tree House Loft and Private Bathroom" in Running Springs, California. Suh said she later messaged the host to ask if she could add two friends to the reservation and was told it would not be a problem. "We were looking forward to it, especially with law school and working and being really busy," Suh told NBC Los Angeles on Wednesday. "It was a welcome break." On Feb. 17, the group of four set out up the mountain. An intense winter storm was then hitting the area, making road conditions hazardous and prompting flash-flood warnings, according to local reports. When they were minutes away from the cabin, Suh sent a message to the host through the Airbnb app to let her know they were close and asked how they might pay for adding the two friends to the reservation, according to the news station. That's when their trip took a turn. "If you think 4 people and 2 dogs ate getting a room fir $50 a night on big bear mountain during the busiest weekend of the year ... . . You are insanely high," the host texted her, according to Suh's screenshots of the exchange. The host, identified as "Tami" in the images, also called Suh "a con artist" and cancelled the reservation. Suh said she was shocked, then protested, telling the host that she had screenshots of their earlier messages showing she had agreed to the reservation changes. "Go ahead. I wouldn't rent to u if you were the last person on earth," the host wrote back to Suh. "One word says it all. Asian" When Suh replied that she would report the host to Airbnb for being racist, the host told her to "Go ahead" and "It's why we have trump ." "And I will not allow this country to be told what to do by foreigners," the host added.

"Just had an airbnb cancel on me spewing racism," she wrote. To compound the problem, the continued snow was making it increasingly dangerous to get down the mountain, according to Suh. "By the grace of God," Suh said in a Facebook comment, there was a crew from KTLA 5 News that happened to be parked near them on the mountain while covering the winter storm. They interviewed Suh. Still reeling from what had just happened, Suh sobbed as she recounted what she said were the host's messages in a widely shared video posted to YouTube this week. Suh said in the video that she has been living in the United States since she was 3 years old. She currently is enrolled in the Critical Race Studies Program at the UCLA School of Law. "I'm an American citizen. This is my home," Suh said in the video. "It stings. It stings that after living in the U.S. for over 23 years, this is what happens." In a comment to her original Facebook post that night, Suh said Airbnb issued them a full refund immediately and offered to reimburse the group for a hotel. Suh also told friends that they "finally found shelter at a cute cabin after two hours of roaming around the snowy mountain." One of her travel companions added on Facebook: "The f--ing woman nearly killed us tonight. We basically ended up stuck up the mountain with no where to stay and the snow coming down harder and harder." Though the incident took place in February, Suh's story became publicly known this week after NBC Los Angeles and KTLA 5 News reported it on Wednesday and Thursday. It is unclear why KTLA 5 did not air the story earlier. Airbnb also acknowledged this week that the host had since been banned. Suh did not immediately respond to an interview request sent Friday around 7:30 a.m. Eastern time through Facebook. Papas, the Airbnb spokesman, confirmed to The Post on Friday that the host had been banned.

The company also rolled out several measures to fight discrimination on its platform, including publishing a more detailed nondiscrimination policy, trying to increase the number of "Instant Book" listings and making user profile photos less prominent during the booking process, presumably to prevent hosts from discriminating based on guest appearances.
