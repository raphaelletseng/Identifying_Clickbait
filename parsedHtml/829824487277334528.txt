Brussels is plunged into darkness by massive power cut


Brussels was plunged into darkness 'in all directions' tonight following a 'massive power cut' in the city.

It is believed the northern part of the EU capital has been affected the worst with the cause still to be identified.

Power firm Sibelga, which handles gas and electricity services in the city, and power network operator Elia have confirmed there is a fault in the grid, with repair teams on site.

Sirens have been heard across the city, which was the victim of a terrorist attack last March.

The power outage is understood to have happened at around 10.45pm local time and it is currently unknown how many people are without power.

Sibelga has been keeping people updated via Twitter and said power was currently being restored 'zone by zone'.

The suburbs of Evere, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert and Schaerbeek have all been affected.

An earlier power cut is understood to have hit a smaller part of the city earlier in the evening but was 'resolved by 8.30pm'.

Residents have been forced to use candles and have posted pictures of their efforts to restore light on social media.

Lights are still on in some EU buildings, including the European Council and European Commission headquarters.
