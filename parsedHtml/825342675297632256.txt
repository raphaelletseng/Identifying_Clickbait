Airbnb set up its new Experiences platform to respond to just those people: Would-be entrepreneurs who want to leave the corporate world behind and follow their dreams. And in turn, these Airbnb Experience Hosts help travelers get to know a destination at a deeper level by allowing them to connect with a local.

I wondered when I would get to travel the world and discover the cities I had never been to, the cultures I had read about in books and the colors only nature can surprise us with. I felt completely lost and depressed. I didn’t understand how I could be good at something (finance) that did not align with my passions. I chased everything society taught me to pursue but, in that one-way road, I ended up losing myself. My soul ached for so much freedom and I was completely afraid to listen to it. The “what if” and “what next” ruled my kingdom until the day I finally understood I couldn’t give up on life. In Bali.

(Photo courtesy of Rian Rochford) Former career: Music industry marketing executive Current career: Desert guide I'm 34-years-old, born and raised in Los Angeles. I am a freelance digital strategist in the music industry (current projects include digital strategy for the estate of Tupac Shakur and digital marketing for an indie record label) and Experience Host for Airbnb, where I host travelers on lifestyle tours of Joshua Tree focusing on art, music, food and nature. Before going independent, I had spent 15 years working full time jobs within the music industry in various roles at major and indie record labels, artist management and music technology companies handling digital strategy and artist relations. I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life, save for five years when a job at Universal Music Group relocated me to NYC. Rochford in Joshua Tree's Boulder Gardens. (Photo courtesy of Rian Rochford) I felt like I was lucky enough to have had every job within the music industry I was excited about and had reached the end of the rope. I started looking at the top of the ladder I was climbing and realized I didn't want the lifestyle of the people at the top. The same year I was starting to question my path, I lost friends to cancer, car accidents and heart attacks — all were under the age of 40. I started to see how much I was taking for granted and wanted to stop living as if I had one life to work and another life to live "someday." I decided to cash out bonuses, vacation pay and the 401(k) and not take on another full-time role in the music industry. Shortly after, I was contacted by Airbnb to be an Experience Host and it gave me the confidence to not only go freelance, but to pursue working in a new capacity I would have never thought of. I definitely went through a difficult period of reorganizing my self-identity since that was so closely tied to what I did for a living. It was so worth it to no longer tie my feeling of self-worth to my title or salary. My friends and family have known me to be pretty resilient (which you need to be in the music industry), so I didn't hear any words of discouragement. The most vocal feedback was feeling inspired and encouraged to explore other options for themselves as well. Posing by an Airstream trailer. (Photo courtesy of Rian Rochford) I feel lucky to be a part of a new wave of Airbnb hosts that are creating income from sharing personal passions with the world. The high desert is my great love and being able to witness others' first look at the beauty of Joshua Tree renews the wonder for me each time. One of my favorite things about hosting my trips is the different aspects of the weekend that resonate more for different people. Some guests are blown away by the artist communities, others are in awe of the beauty of the Joshua Tree National Park itself, and many guests rave about the food. I taught one European guest how to eat ribs for the first time, and he said that was his favorite moment of the whole trip! I just love hosting such an eclectic mix of guests from all over the world and seeing what they react to. I was making a six figure salary before and have almost matched my salary as a freelancer. Taking in the landscape. (Photo courtesy of Rian Rochford) The most notable downside I've seen so far in working independently is that it takes much more effort and awareness to create a sense of community. When you show up to an office every day you automatically have a bond to build upon with others. As a freelancer you have to seek out your "tribe" and put energy into finding your rhythm to build those relationships. Also, health insurance and budgeting finances (write-offs, paying quarterly taxes) is a new challenge, but I'm finding it manageable.  Betting on yourself is the best investment you can make. Those "safe jobs" will still be there if you decide you want to go back to that path. Designer Tiffany Zadi in her leather studio. (Photo courtesy of Tiffany Zadi) Former career: Current career: I am a 35-year-old designer and leatherworker. I have a line of leather handbags and accessories called Heist based out of Miami. I was born and raised here, but I lived in Boston and New York before returning. I actually went to law school and sat for the bar exam in both Massachusetts and Florida. Before I switched to doing Heist full time I was working a series of legal temp jobs and doing some contractual and probate work around Boston and then in Miami. I started my first company in 2004 and re-branded as Heist in 2008. Throughout my studies I continued to design and sell my work, even setting up a tiny home studio in my Boston apartment. My goal was always to get to a point where I could run my business full time. When I started doing legal work I quickly realized office life wasn’t for me and I wanted to get out as soon as possible. When one of my temp projects ended I decided to take a break and focus on Heist. As I was able to spend more time on Heist without other commitments, the business began to grow and I began turning down legal work. I kind of just shifted my focus from one thing to the other and seeing some momentum within the business was all I needed to jump ship. Heist totes. (Photo courtesy of Heist) I think it’s scarier looking back on it now than it actually felt at the time. I thought I was going to take a break and then return to legal work, I never imagined I would get the opportunity to do what I love and actually make a living doing it. People definitely thought I was crazy and I think a lot of them still do! No one understands why someone would go to law school and take two bar exams and then not practice law. But when something doesn’t fit, you just know it. AirBnb asked me to create an experience and together we created an afternoon series of workshops that I host . We meet for lunch then head to a maker space for a tour and then we get down to work. I teach a saddle-stitching workshop and then a fellow maker teaches a soldering workshop. We sip wine and talk shop and everyone has a great time while creating pieces they can take home and say they made themselves. I love how proud people are when they finish their piece and they say, “I made this!” Another great thing about being a host is that now there’s a consistent income source that I never could have imagined before, which only further allows me to pursue and grow my passion. Plus, a good amount of guests have become friends and followers on social media, so Heist gets promotion, too. Let’s just say I definitely don’t make as much money now than I did when practicing law full time! That being said, I don’t regret my decision at all. The path to revenue growth is certainly more complicated this way, but the potential for where it could lead is huge and it’s that challenge that keeps me going. It is pretty isolating at times. There’s no chatting around the water cooler or co-workers’ birthdays to celebrate. However, hosting experiences on Airbnb has helped as I am constantly meeting new people through my programming. I’m definitely making less money than I did working office jobs, so that’s a downside. Also there’s the unpredictability of running your own business, some months are up and some are down. I don’t get paid vacation days — if I’m not here to do the work, it’s not going to get done. Don’t be impulsive about it. Make a thorough plan, be clear on your goals, have some savings in place and then act. Once you quit, the pressure is on and it’s best to have as many pieces in place before that moment arrives. That being said, there’s only so much planning you can do. At some point you have to commit and dive in. You’ll be happy you did.

(Photo courtesy of Emma Rock) Former career: Antique dealer Current career: Supper club host I am 27-years-old, living in Poplar, East London. Born in London and lived here all my life. Since leaving my job in March last year I have been earning a living putting on creative events and cooking for people in supper clubs and private events. My business is called Season Supper Club and is aimed at (but not exclusive to) women in the creative arts. The menu changes seasonally and is created with the freshest ingredients in mind. I started as an Airbnb trip host in November last year, as a way of taking Season to a wider audience. I was managing an antique shop and the gallery that’s also part of the building — which is a fantastic five-story house dating from 1721 and situated in Spitalfields, East London. Working in this environment was really fun, and I was always surrounded by interesting objects and artwork. I was also working on other freelance arts events. A Season Supper Club party. (Photo courtesy of Season Supper Club) Although I loved my job, I had been there for about four years and I felt as though I had grown out of it — it is quite a small business and I felt as though I had learned everything I could there. I also wanted to do something I had more creative control over. What I really love about being an Airbnb Experience Host is that I am able to design and deliver the experience exactly how I want it. When I decided to leave my job, I think it was something I had been considering for a long time, so my boss was quite supportive of my decision. I think my Mum was a bit scared I’d be moving back home though! But I felt this was a risk worth taking, as I do also think its good to try a lot of different things; something my own career reflects. There were times when I was working on about four different jobs at once, because I like variety and opportunity to work with lots of different types of people. A table set up for a Season Supper Club event. (Photo courtesy of Season Supper Club) I love the fact it gives me the opportunity to meet travelers from all over the world — who can come together around the dinner table and teach me and each other about themselves. It has also provided me with a great platform to pursue my passion. And it’s given me the opportunity to develop my experience into something I am proud of. The event I run represents the cultural heritage of East London over the past 300 years and celebrates food from all the different people who have lived in the area. Working with Airbnb and hosting regular experiences means I have had the chance to really hone the event and design something interesting, genuine and well thought out for my guests. I am now earning more than in my old job, but I have to pay myself out of my profit so it’s a little bit more complicated. I’ve had to learn how to keep track of all my finances, something that I definitely needed a bit of practice with. Dining with Season Supper Club. (Photo courtesy of Season Supper Club) I think it’s a challenge to be self employed and to have to constantly drive business on your own. I have to be constantly looking for new opportunities and ways to develop what I do. Also any time I am not working, I am not getting paid! One benefit of working for someone else is that you get paid at the end of every month – although I would say that being able to make all my own decisions outweighs this downside. I think it is something to think very seriously about, and maybe it’s a good idea to have a back up plan. However, I think if you are prepared to work hard at something you love, it can make you really happy to take control.    Trending on {{channel_name}}

Ever dreamed of quitting your corporate desk job to pursue your passions and your love of travel? You're not alone. According to a recent Harris Poll for Airbnb, 64 percent of U.S. workers say they would leave their current job for one that allowed them to be more involved in things they are passionate about.

Airbnb set up its new Experiences platform to respond to just those people: Would-be entrepreneurs who want to leave the corporate world behind and follow their dreams. And in turn, these Airbnb Experience Hosts help travelers get to know a destination at a deeper level by allowing them to connect with a local.

Here are four women who have successfully made the leap. These newfound entrepreneurs tell what it took to quit their jobs and pursue their passions — and why they aren't looking back.

BANKER TURNED LIFESTYLE GURU

Who: Valeria Hinojosa

Old career: Banker

New career: Eco blogger and yoga instructor

Laura Begley Bloom: Tell me about yourself. Valeria Hinojosa: I’m a 29-year-old plant-based yogi with a mind of a social entrepreneur and the heart of an adventurous nature-lover. Born and raised in Bolivia (South America) but have been living in sunny Miami for the past nine years. Begley Bloom: What do you do for a living? Hinojosa: I’m a conscious lifestyle and travel blogger, which (in plain English) means that I get to travel the world to discover and write about eco-friendly boutique hotels and the sustainable practices and lifestyle they promote. I also focus on brands that are reshaping the fashion, food and home design industries by introducing products made with alternative materials that don’t harm our planet and our people. And last but not least, I give motivational talks and workshops to introduce my readers to the basics of living consciously, offer yoga and adventure retreats worldwide and host Airbnb Experiences. About one to two weekends of every month I spend hosting my Airbnb Experience and meeting new people. Begley Bloom: What were you doing before you quit your job? Hinojosa: I used to be a private banker doing the stressful 9-5 and sitting in an office surrounded by white walls and two computer screens. I worked in the banking industry for five years, straight out of college, passed the nerve-racking Series 7 and 63 and thought that was the career I was supposed to be chasing. It wasn’t until my last year in banking that I realized I had completely lost myself. Begley Bloom: What inspired you to make the change? Hinojosa: In that same office was a big window behind my desk that peeked into Miami’s blue ocean. I remember being captivated by it every time I turned around to reach the phone or a document from the shelf behind me. I would stare at it and immediately wonder when I would get the chance to float on those waters without stressing about phone calls, meetings or paperwork. I wondered when I would get to travel the world and discover the cities I had never been to, the cultures I had read about in books and the colors only nature can surprise us with. I felt completely lost and depressed. I didn’t understand how I could be good at something (finance) that did not align with my passions. I chased everything society taught me to pursue but, in that one-way road, I ended up losing myself. My soul ached for so much freedom and I was completely afraid to listen to it. The “what if” and “what next” ruled my kingdom until the day I finally understood I couldn’t give up on life.

Begley Bloom: Was it scary? Hinojosa: YES! And everyone around me — except for my dad, my brother and my best friends — thought I was absolutely wacko! I quit banking without a Plan B and with an embarrassing savings account for a banker. (I, sadly, had other priorities at that time. Most of them revolved around pretending to be someone I was not, and dressing like it!) A few months prior to quitting, I started my blog WaterThruSkin, but at that point, it was more of a hobby than an income-producing career. It was a way of venting my thoughts and emotions and connecting with other conscious souls out there. I never in a million years thought my blog would become a full-time job and that it would take me to the most natural and magical places of the world without me having to spend a penny traveling. Begley Bloom: What's it like to be an Airbnb Experience Host? Hinojosa: It has been awesome in every sense of the word. To get to share my passions, my blog and why I believe consciousness and a lifestyle can go hand in hand, with others is absolutely priceless. I get to meet like-minded individuals in Miami, take them to my favorite vegan restaurants, teach them to flow on their yoga mats and find balance on their paddleboards, all while sharing with them details of every experience I lived since I started my blog. Inspiration and motivation light up their faces and open their minds to a world of adventures, freedom and sustainability. Every single time!

Begley Bloom: Are you making more or less than when you worked full-time? Hinojosa: Because of bank privacy, I can’t disclose figures, but I can share details of what pushed me to take the final step and quit my career in banking. It was the day I got promoted to the position and the six-figure salary I had always dreamed of. Once I received the news, I didn’t jump in excitement — as any other normal person would’ve — but I entered into a state of panic in which I realized that accepting that offer would mean another three to five years in banking, chasing dreams and figures that did not add value to my life. My first year as a blogger was difficult because I was getting my name out there and trying to grow a social media audience from zero. I went from making a lot of money in banking to traveling the world for free but with $100 in my account and some overdraft fees here and there. Now, I am blessed enough to be able to get invited to luxurious and adventurous eco-friendly hotels while also getting sponsored by sustainable fashion brands, plant-based supplement brands, PR companies, yoga studios, etc. I’m making what I used to earn in banking but this time, I’m actually doing something I’m passionate about. Blogging has also opened a lot of doors for me. I’m currently writing a book about my story and the trips I’ve embarked on, in the process of creating an app for the conscious consumer and I have been working with Airbnb as an Experience Host in Miami. Begley Bloom: Are there downsides to what you're doing now?

Hinojosa: To be honest, I don’t think so. Every bump, fall and bruise has been a learning lesson. Begley Bloom: What advice would you give to someone else who is considering quitting their job and making a big career change? Hinojosa: Be raw, be you and be ready to risk it all when it comes to pursuing your dreams. If it’s your soul’s purpose and calling, it’s worth it. I lost my home, my car and my credit cards the minute I decided to leave the corporate zombie world behind in order to go out there to find what I was made of. I was fortunate enough to have a mom that let me stay with her for eight months, my ex that believed in me even in the moments where I lost faith and a dad that reminded me on a daily basis that I was stronger and wiser than I thought. Yes, you’ll struggle and you’ll cry and you’ll feel like you’ve hit rock-bottom a dozen times but once you make it, you’ll understand the real meaning of life. And recreating yourself as many times as it takes is part of it. Don’t fear it. MUSIC EXEC TURNED DESERT GUIDE

Who: Rian Rochford

Former career: Music industry marketing executive

Current career: Desert guide

Laura Begley Bloom: Tell me about yourself.

Rian Rochford: I'm 34-years-old, born and raised in Los Angeles. I am a freelance digital strategist in the music industry (current projects include digital strategy for the estate of Tupac Shakur and digital marketing for an indie record label) and Experience Host for Airbnb, where I host travelers on lifestyle tours of Joshua Tree focusing on art, music, food and nature.

Begley Bloom: What were you doing before you quit your job?

Rochford: Before going independent, I had spent 15 years working full time jobs within the music industry in various roles at major and indie record labels, artist management and music technology companies handling digital strategy and artist relations. I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life, save for five years when a job at Universal Music Group relocated me to NYC.

Begley Bloom: What inspired you to make the change?

Rochford: I felt like I was lucky enough to have had every job within the music industry I was excited about and had reached the end of the rope. I started looking at the top of the ladder I was climbing and realized I didn't want the lifestyle of the people at the top. The same year I was starting to question my path, I lost friends to cancer, car accidents and heart attacks — all were under the age of 40. I started to see how much I was taking for granted and wanted to stop living as if I had one life to work and another life to live "someday." I decided to cash out bonuses, vacation pay and the 401(k) and not take on another full-time role in the music industry. Shortly after, I was contacted by Airbnb to be an Experience Host and it gave me the confidence to not only go freelance, but to pursue working in a new capacity I would have never thought of.

Begley Bloom: Was it scary?

Rochford: I definitely went through a difficult period of reorganizing my self-identity since that was so closely tied to what I did for a living. It was so worth it to no longer tie my feeling of self-worth to my title or salary. My friends and family have known me to be pretty resilient (which you need to be in the music industry), so I didn't hear any words of discouragement. The most vocal feedback was feeling inspired and encouraged to explore other options for themselves as well.

Begley Bloom: What's it like to be an Airbnb Experience Host?

Rochford: I feel lucky to be a part of a new wave of Airbnb hosts that are creating income from sharing personal passions with the world. The high desert is my great love and being able to witness others' first look at the beauty of Joshua Tree renews the wonder for me each time. One of my favorite things about hosting my trips is the different aspects of the weekend that resonate more for different people. Some guests are blown away by the artist communities, others are in awe of the beauty of the Joshua Tree National Park itself, and many guests rave about the food. I taught one European guest how to eat ribs for the first time, and he said that was his favorite moment of the whole trip! I just love hosting such an eclectic mix of guests from all over the world and seeing what they react to.

Begley Bloom: Are you making more or less than when you worked full-time?

Rochford: I was making a six figure salary before and have almost matched my salary as a freelancer. I feel confident now to diversify my income. I no longer feel like I have "swam too far to turn back" and need to stick with what I know. Getting paid to do something completely different has opened my mind up to what is possible.

Begley Bloom: Are there downsides to what you're doing now?

Rochford: The most notable downside I've seen so far in working independently is that it takes much more effort and awareness to create a sense of community. When you show up to an office every day you automatically have a bond to build upon with others. As a freelancer you have to seek out your "tribe" and put energy into finding your rhythm to build those relationships. Also, health insurance and budgeting finances (write-offs, paying quarterly taxes) is a new challenge, but I'm finding it manageable.

Begley Bloom: What advice would you give to someone else who is considering quitting their job and making a big career change?

Rochford: Don't confuse making a living with making a life. Betting on yourself is the best investment you can make. Even if you fall short of what you set out to accomplish, what you gain in that journey will be worth it. Those "safe jobs" will still be there if you decide you want to go back to that path.

LAWYER TURNED LEATHER DESIGNER

Who: Tiffany Zadi

Former career: Trained lawyer

Current career: Leather designer

Laura Begley Bloom: Tell me about yourself.

Tiffany Zadi: I am a 35-year-old designer and leatherworker. I have a line of leather handbags and accessories called Heist based out of Miami. I was born and raised here, but I lived in Boston and New York before returning.

Begley Bloom: What were you doing before you quit your job?

Zadi: I actually went to law school and sat for the bar exam in both Massachusetts and Florida. Before I switched to doing Heist full time I was working a series of legal temp jobs and doing some contractual and probate work around Boston and then in Miami.

Begley Bloom: What inspired you to make the change?

Zadi: Let’s just say I definitely don’t make as much money now than I did when practicing law full time! That being said, I don’t regret my decision at all. I would never trade the freedom and challenges running your own business brings for a higher paycheck. The path to revenue growth is certainly more complicated this way, but the potential for where it could lead is huge and it’s that challenge that keeps me going.

Begley Bloom: Are there downsides to what you're doing now?

ANTIQUE DEALER TURNED SUPPER CLUB HOST
