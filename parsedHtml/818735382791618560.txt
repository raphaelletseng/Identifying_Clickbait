Best film

Photos: "La La Land," which just earned seven Golden Globe awards, features a scene shot on the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena with stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Hide Caption 1 of 7 Photos: Gosling plays Sebastian, a musician struggling to turn his passion into a livelihood. This scene was shot at the SmokeHouse, a classic L.A. steak house where prime rib has been on the menu since 1946. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: Gosling's Sebastian strolls along Hermosa Beach Pier and croons "City of Stars" in the film. The pier extends 1,000 feet into the Pacific Ocean from the sandy shores of South Bay L.A.'s most buoyant 'hood. Hide Caption 3 of 7 Photos: Steps from the pier, Hermosa's famed bistro and music joint The Lighthouse Caf√© has welcomed jazz headliners since 1949 -- remaining one of the city's few live music joints featuring regular jazz artists. Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: Perched high in the hills, Griffith Observatory and the surrounding park have roles in "La La Land." Dance duet "A Lovely Night" happens on Mt. Hollywood Drive, west of the Observatory. Hide Caption 5 of 7 Photos: Even L.A.'s notoriously congested freeways get the star treatment in "La La Land." A traffic jam of drivers-turned-singers-and-dancers turns a gridlocked ramp into the movie's exuberant opening number. Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: Filmed at Hollywood Center Studios, this shot is supposed to be at Warner Brothers Studios, which was also a "La La Land" filming location. Hide Caption 7 of 7
