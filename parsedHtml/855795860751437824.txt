Over 400 Militants Surrender In Pakistan's Balochistan Province That Is Seeking Independence While Pakistan is continuing atrocities against the people of Balochistan who are seeking separation, the locals, at the same time, are giving up violence in hope of peace in the region. According to reports, as many as 434 militants belonging to different banned outfits have surrendered in the region. Reports suggest that militants, who handed over their arms to authorities, belong to the Baloch Republican Army (BRA), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and other separatist groups alleged to have carried out attacks on security installations and personnel in the troubled province. Commander Southern Command Lieutenant General Amir Riaz said on the occasion that those wanting to return to normal life were welcome to do so after surrendering. "Anyone laying down their arms would be welcomed," he said. Balochistan Chief Minister Sanaullah Zehri alleged that for long foreign agencies had used innocent people in the province, misleading and instigating them. Sher Mohammad, a key commander of the proscribed BLA, said they had been deceived by "anti-Pakistan" elements. A senior provincial official said so far over 1,500 militants have surrendered.
