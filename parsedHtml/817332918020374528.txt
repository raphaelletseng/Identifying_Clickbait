Bidding for tuna at Tsukiji
Bidding for tuna at Tsukiji
Tokyo’s Tsukiji market holds its 2017 tuna auction, believed to bring good luck for the new year. It's among the biggest of Japan's many New Year's holiday rituals: Early on Thursday, a huge, glistening tuna was auctioned for 74.2 million yen ($643,000) in what may be the 81-year-old Tsukiji market’s last auction at its current site in downtown Tokyo. Last year’s auction was supposed to be the last at Tsukiji’s current location. The shift to a new facility on Tokyo Bay was delayed as a result of soil contamination at the former gas-plant site. The latest assessment by scientists portends what is likely a bleak future for the Pacific bluefin tuna, a favorite of sushi lovers. The bluefin population has dropped by more than 97 percent from its highest levels. (AP/Reuters)
