27 Times Tumblr Was Beautifully Wholesome
27 Times Tumblr Was Beautifully Wholesome
When this grandma was honestly too much. When these abbreviations were explained. When this game looked really realistic. When Kim Kardashians were super supportive. And when this wholesome meme appeared. When this bird was overwhelmingly precious. When this frog understood the importance of teamwork. When got a little too deep. When this business knew no bounds. When there was this tear-jerking meme. When northerners and southerners were finally united. When this villain was finally caught. When this dog was super studious. When this magical moment happened. When this new species was born. And when this dolphin was fully appreciated. When this maths problem came to life. When maths got involved. When grammar was important. When these deer just wanted some retail therapy. When this doggo got spooky. When the truth about puberty was exposed. When this hummingbird was thirsty. When this romance was everything. When this cat and horse were friendship goals. When supply teachers were shown respect. When Tumblr was just beautiful and supportive in every way. Need more LOL in your life?
