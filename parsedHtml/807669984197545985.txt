MILITARY Trump to attend Army-Navy football game in Baltimore President-elect Donald Trump is partaking in one the nation's most storied football rivalries, saluting U.S. troops at the annual Army-Navy game on Saturday as he prepares to enter the White House. The future commander-in-chief plans to attend the 117th game between the military academies at West Point and Annapolis, which is being held at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium. Trump's appearance caps a week that saw him roll out more Cabinet picks, hold "thank you" rallies in North Carolina, Iowa and Michigan and try to shore up the GOP's incoming Senate majority with Saturday's runoff election in Louisiana. The incoming president appeared jovial and relaxed as he plunged back into electoral politics on Friday, a full month after he won the presidency, at large-scale events in Michigan and Louisiana.
