The Golden Globe audience had already noticed that something seemed 'off' about the host, observing an apparent lack of energy that led to some rather awkward interactions with Keith Urban, Amy Adams, Michelle Williams and Natalie Portman.

The #AskHerMore campaign launched by actress and comedian, director and producer Amy Poehler, which began in 2014 prompted reporters to ask actresses questions about their work rather than what they were wearing.

One stand-out moment at the Screen Actors Guild awards that year was Cate Blanchett, who caught a cameraman taking a sweeping, full-length shot of her to capture her outfit.

"Do you do that to the guys?" she demanded.

Since 2014 the campaign has been supported by the likes of Reese Witherspoon, Julianne Moore and Patricia Arquette.
