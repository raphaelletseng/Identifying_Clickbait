Watch Vin Diesel and Mark Zuckerberg Strike Up a Bromance at Science Awards Show


Hollywood stars and tech superstars collided this weekend at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley to honor the biggest achievements in science at the Breakthrough Prizes.

Currently in its fifth year, the awards show has attracted A-list celebrities such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Redmayne, Cameron Diaz, Christina Aguilera, Hilary Swank, and Jon Hamm. The stars came out again in support this year, with Vin Diesel, Jeremy Irons, Morgan Freeman, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Dev Patel presenting alongside tech giants Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, Yuri Milner, Anne Wojcicki, and Jack Ma.

A committee of past recipients award 15 prizes, including six $100,000 New Horizons Prizes for early career accomplishments as well as a $250,000 Breakthrough Junior Prize for a teenager who has created a compelling video explaining scientific concepts. A sum of $25 million is bestowed for outstanding scientific work across three fields: life sciences, mathematics, and fundamental physics.

Actor Vin Diesel presented with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and sparks definitely flew. Check out the video above for a closer look at their budding bromance on the red carpet.
