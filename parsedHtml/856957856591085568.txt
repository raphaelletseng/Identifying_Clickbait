Inside the insanely lavish Airbnb homes Drake and Lady Gaga stayed in for Coachella


The headliners of any given year's Coachella festival are pretty much musicÂ royalty, and at the 2017 fest that just wrapped last weekend, they were definitely treated as such inÂ their accomdations for their stay.

Drake, Lady Gaga, and Kendrick Lamar stayed in luxurious homes provided by Airbnb. TheÂ large pool spaces, fire pits, mountain views, and in-home barsÂ (and a wine cellar) gave the artists a lot of room to relax in between their performances, which last over two weekends. One of the Airbnb homes even has a tennis court. As withÂ just about everything that goes on at Coachella, these rentals go all out.

They also come at hefty prices as high as $10,000 a night. But the best part for the stars? They got to stay in them for free. (They shouted out their thanks on social media.)
