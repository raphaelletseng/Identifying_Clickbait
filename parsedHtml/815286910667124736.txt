Donald Trump Lets Bygones Be Bygones In New Year's Tweet (Just Kidding!)
President-elect Donald Trump is putting the “dip” in diplomacy, if his New Year’s Eve tweet is any indication. The Donald has decided to ring in the New Year with a heartfelt tweet wishing good tidings to all. Just kidding! That would have been the respectful thing for the soon-to-be leader of the free world to do. Instead, he posted a bitter pill. Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love! Most politicians are savvy enough to just issue a blanket “Happy New Year” without calling out the haters. Even Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who threatened to throw corrupt officials out of a plane earlier this year, found a way to simply wish people “Happy New Year” without any passive-aggressive digs. The first line of Duterte’s tweet below roughly translates as: Malipayong Bag-ong Tuig kaninyong tanan, gikan nako, sa akong pamilya ug mga suluguon sa gobyerno. Atong sugaton... https://t.co/TR04iqMIFe Meanwhile, Trump’s twisted tweet ― posted at 5:17 a.m. ― sent a message that he will not be letting go of 2016’s slights for the greater goal of running the country in 2017. At least that’s how it was interpreted by many. Our President-elect's #HappyNewYear message is passive-aggressive condescension. Grow up, @realDonaldTrump . You're embarrassing yourself. @realDonaldTrump Wow, what a nice and totally not scornful New Year wish! Very presidential! @realDonaldTrump We know what to do: Whatever it takes to remove you from office in 2017. Happy New Year. 🎉 Clinton: *says sexists and xenophobes are deplorable* "How dare you" Trump: *Calls Americans "enemies."* "..." https://t.co/gFnuuFI90v Also, @realDonaldTrump : in the popular vote, who was it again who "lost so badly"? #MinorityPresident  pic.twitter.com/wD3zGYH0x6 #NeverForget when Trump sent this tweet, manually retweeted himself and then deleted the original tweet pic.twitter.com/hhU6MISeHx @realDonaldTrump With each tweet you show yourself to be more pathetic. Any 12-year-old I know is more mature than u, old fool. This kind of greeting is the mark of a soulless man, consumed by narcissism. https://t.co/KKclZnvfGt I wish you a happy impeachment, @realDonaldTrump .

Most politicians are savvy enough to just issue a blanket “Happy New Year” without calling out the haters.

Even Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who threatened to throw corrupt officials out of a plane earlier this year, found a way to simply wish people “Happy New Year” without any passive-aggressive digs.

The first line of Duterte’s tweet below roughly translates as:

“Happy New Year to all of you, from me, my family and servants in the government.”

Malipayong Bag-ong Tuig kaninyong tanan, gikan nako, sa akong pamilya ug mga suluguon sa gobyerno.
