Story highlights The Tonner Doll Company has made the world's first transgender doll

It is based on transgender teen advocate, Jazz Jennings

(CNN) Like any other girl, 16-y old Jazz Jennings always loved dolls and dresses. But Jazz wasn't a normal girl - she was born a boy. She is one of the youngest people to be documented as transgender, and it has garnered her a following. The latest installment of this appreciative fandom is a doll version of the teen.

The Tonner Doll Company, which specializes in adult collectibles and high fashion dolls, is releasing a Jazz Jennings doll that was designed and sculpted by the founder of the company, Robert Tonner.

The doll will come with a pink shirt and jean shorts, mirroring the outfit that Jazz wears on the cover of her memoir, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen . It debuted at the New York Toy Fair over the weekend.

"Jazz stands for everything I respect from a human nature point of view," Tonner said in a statement. "She's incredibly brave, intelligent, warm-hearted and creative."

The company is marketing the doll to children, instead of as an adult collectible.
