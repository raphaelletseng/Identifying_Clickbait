The hottest Aussie city just had its coldest day and people really freaked out
Australia's hottest capital city, Darwin, has two distinct seasons: Wet and Dry. None of the namby-pamby Spring, or Autumn business up there. But the flip-flop-loving residents of the fair subtropical city got one hell of shock on Tuesday, when temperatures hit a frosty low of 19 degrees Celsius (66.2 Fahrenheit).Â It might not seem cold, but for a town used to 85-degree Fahrenheit days pretty much year-round, the sudden drop gave them a case of the too-colds, and they wouldn't stop talking about it.
