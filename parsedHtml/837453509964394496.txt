That, apparently, is what happened to former New York Jets center Nick Mangold . Back on February 25, Mangold took to his Twitter page to announce he and the Jets would part ways after 11 years. In that post, Mangold thanked coaches, teammates, executives, team owner Woody Johnson and the fans. The 33-year-old then poked some fun at himself via Twitter on Thursday, although one can't help but wonder if brighter days are ahead for the veteran if he signs for a contender once free agency opens March 9. It seems Disney World isn't always the happiest place on Earth, after all. [ Twitter ] Like the new article format? Send us feedback ! Where can I comment?
