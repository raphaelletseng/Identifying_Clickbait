Actor George Takei caused a moment of extreme excitement early Saturday morning when he posted an article from The Daily Buzz on his Twitter account that said he was planning to run for Congress and against Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) in 2018. Well, the cat's out of the bag it seems. Let's do this! #Takei2018  https://t.co/Wf7qvV1eXj Some Twitter users noted that the tweet had been posted just minutes into April 1, and about eight hours later Takei confirmed that, yes, this was an April Fools’ Day joke. No, I'm not running for Congress. Happy 4/1! But Jon Ossoff is on 4/18. Help him win at https://t.co/ctCcRiYcdL . Let's flip Congress in '18 pic.twitter.com/41uj6l3yt7 But between the time when Takei posted the tweet and when he clarified that he was joking, people started to get extremely excited by the idea of the beloved “Star Trek” star running for Congress and some of them were quite famous too. @GeorgeTakei I hope you can count me as one of your early endorsers!!
