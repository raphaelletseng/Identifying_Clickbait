(CNN) Some Queenslanders didn't take police warnings to stay out of flood waters very seriously -- until a bull shark washed up in the street.

Northeastern Australia is still dealing with the aftermath of Cyclone Debbie, which swept across the Queensland coast on Tuesday, causing widespread damage with winds up to 185 kph (114 mph).

It has since been downgraded to a low pressure system but is still moving slowly down the eastern coast, dumping hundreds of millimeters of rains.

EMERGENCY SERVICES: PLS PLS PLS don't go in flood waters

No deaths have been recorded so far, but areas of southeast Queensland have been hit with extensive flooding.

Australian emergency services have repeatedly warned people to stay out of the flood waters, after photos and videos emerged of locals playing in flooded streets, and even doing some surfing.
