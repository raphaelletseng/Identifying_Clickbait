50 Cent Mercilessly Trolls Soulja Boy Following Alleged Robbery
In recent months, Soulja Boy has found himself being ridiculed by actor Shia LaBeouf as well as being made into a meme by Joe Budden and others on account of his DJ Vlad interview. In addition to reportedly beefing with Chris Brown , Soulja Boy now finds himself the butt of some of 50 Cent‚Äôs Instagram jokes. Fif‚Äôs been poking fun at both Soulja Boy and Chris Brown on Instagram the last few days while promoting a charity boxing event between Brown and Soulja Boy as well as 21 Savage and 22 Savage. Given 50‚Äôs previous experience engaging in viral beef with Fat Joe, Rick Ross, and Vivica Fox, the Queens MC had no shortage of memes and playful yet disrespectful talk.

That don‚Äôt mean the fight is off. He got no choice. He gotta fight now, right? Floyd [Mayweather] is supposed to be training him, but I kinda feel like Floyd wants to train him just so he can beat me.‚Äù The show must go on Soulja, forget the chain, train üòâ. #putthegunsdown #thefightstillon A photo posted by 50 Cent (@50cent) on Jan 6, 2017 at 7:02pm PST  Man this is gonna be something to watch.

Soulja Boy and 50 collaborated on the track ‚ÄúMean Mug‚Äù in 2010, so Fif‚Äôs latest round of posts work in a trio of ‚Äúfrenimies‚Äù all at the same time.
