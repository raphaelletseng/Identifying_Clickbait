The Republican plan to repeal and “replace” the Affordable Care Act would increase the number of Americans without health coverage by 24 million and reduce the federal budget deficit by $337 billion by 2026, according to a Congressional Budget Office report published Monday.

These negative findings give lie to Trump’s repeated promises that the Republican alternative would provide universal coverage and lower prices for Americans. Shortly before taking office, for example, Trump told The Washington Post that “we’re going to have insurance for everybody” that would be “much less expensive and much better.”

Congressional GOP leaders already are embroiled in a major struggle to get rank-and-file lawmakers to embrace the legislation. A negative CBO score could make their goal of passing a health care reform bill in the House and Senate and sending it to Trump’s desk by mid-April even more difficult.

The law Republicans are trying to “replace” extended health coverage to 20 million previously uninsured people, reduced the national uninsured rate to the lowest ever recorded and is projected to reduce the federal budget deficit by as much as $137 billion to $353 billion by 2025, according to a 2015 Congressional Budget Office analysis.
