Borussia Dortmund bus bombs detonated by 'MOBILE PHONE'
Borussia Dortmund team bus hit by explosion


The explosion that hit the Borussia Dortmund team bus ahead of their Champions League quarter-final with Monaco was a targeted attack against the team, German police say.

The three explosions happened as Borussia Dortmund was leaving the L'Arrivee Hotel and Spa, about six miles or a 12-minute drive from the stadium, Signal Iduna Park, for a match against Monaco.

The chief executive of a Dortmund, Hans-Joachim Watzke, said police informed him that the explosives that went off near the team bus were hidden by the exit of a hotel and detonated as the bus passed.

Defender Marc Bartra was injured in the explosion and was taken to hospital, the team said on Twitter. Dortmund told supporters on Twitter that Bartra was undergoing surgery on his right wrist following the incident.

Tuesday night's match was cancelled following the explosion and has been rescheduled for Wednesday.

While investigators do not yet know the source of the explosions, police have confirmed that additional 'suspicious objects' were found at the Dortmund team hotel in the wake of the bus bombing.

A German prosecutor said Tuesday night that a letter found outside the hotel the team bus was departing from when the explosions happened 'takes responsibility for the act'.

Prosecutor Sandra Luecke said authorities won't give details of the letter at this stage, citing the ongoing investigation. The authenticity of the letter has not been verified.

Forensic experts searched the area where the explosion occurred in the hours after the incident

Officers did not reveal the nature of the find but confirmed that a drone was deployed to assist in the search around the hotel.

Gunnar Wortmann, a police spokesman, said: 'We will be working throughout the night to discover who was behind this attack. All police and vehicles in Dortmund have been mobilized.'

Dortmund city's police chief Gregor Lange added: "We are assuming that they were a targeted attack against the Dortmund team.'

Three explosions detonating at the exact moment the bus passed by suggest a sophisticated expertise in both bomb building and detonation - perhaps using a mobile phone or a garage door-opening device.

BORUSSIA DORTMUND BUS EXPLOSIONS AS IT HAPPENED 6.15pm (BST) Three explosions are heard outside the L'Arrivee Hotel and Spa as the Borussia Dortmund team make their way to their home stadium for their Champions League match against Monaco.

The club thanked supporters of opponent Monaco for their 'patience and understanding' and for chanting 'Dortmund! Dortmund!' when the reason for the postponement was announced 8.05pm The chief executive of Borussia Dortmund Hans-Joachim Watzke confirms Marc Bartra's injuries are 'nothing life-threatening'. Dortmund police spokeswoman Nina Vogt says investigators do not yet know the source of the explosions that went off. 8.20pm Police inform Mr Watzke that the explosives that went off near the team bus were hidden by the exit of a hotel and detonated as the bus passed. He said in a video on the club's website that the team 'is totally shocked' by the explosions that damaged the bus and injured defender Marc Bartra. He added: 'It's our task now to digest this somehow because it's only 24 hours before we have to play. That's our job.' 8.45pm Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki said 'there was a huge bang, literally an explosion' that sent glass flying about on the bus. He added: 'We're all shocked. Nobody thought about a football match in the minutes after that.'

But nearly three hours after the attack there were no real clues as to who may have been behind it.

Neither club has a radical fan following, leading to speculation it may yet be claimed by radical Islamist groups.

There are no indications that the three explosions were part of an organised terror attack, national news agency DPA reported, citing unnamed security sources.

'No element' points in the direction of such an assault, said the German agency, in line with police who have so far also avoided describing it as a terror attack.

Shortly after the explosions, police confirmed that there was no immediate danger to anyone in and around the football stadium.

Police said in a statement they were working on the assumption that the blasts were caused by 'serious explosive devices', which may have been hidden in a hedge near a car park.

They didn't elaborate on the possible nature of the devices or say who might have planted them ahead of first-leg match between Borussia Dortmund and Monaco.

Explosive devices were believed to have been placed in a bush by the road along which the bus was travelling, according to German newspaper Bild.

'The explosive devices were placed outside the bus. Several windows were broken,' police spokesman Gunnar Wortmann was quoted as saying.

In a statement, Dortmund police said earlier that they could not say 'exactly what the explosion was or exactly where something exploded'.

'According to what is currently known, the windows of the bus were (entirely or partly) smashed and one person was injured,' Dortmund police said, adding that the incident happened in Hoechsten, located outside the city.

Several windows were smashed in the explosion, and Bartra, a Spanish national, was the only player to be taken to hospital.

Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki said the team bus had just pulled out of the hotel driveway when it was rocked by an explosion.

Buerki told Swiss daily Blick that 'there was a huge bang, literally an explosion' that sent glass flying about.

The Swiss keeper said he was sitting in the last row of the bus, next to Bartra. He said Bartra was hit by shards of glass from the broken back window.

Buerki added that players ducked for cover, wondering if there would be more explosions. He said police were at the scene quickly.

The goalkeeper told Blick: 'We're all shocked. Nobody thought about a football match in the minutes after that.'

Bartra, the only player injured in the explosion, joined the club from Barcelona last year, and his former club were quick to wish him well.

'All of our support to @MarcBartra, @BVB and their fans,' Barcelona tweeted in support of their former player.

Bartra, 26, joined Dortmund for eight million euros ($8.48million, Â£6.79million) last year from Barcelona, after coming through the Catalan club's youth system.

He has made 12 appearances for the Spanish national team.

Borussia Dortmund's managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke was quoted telling Sky TV: 'The whole team is in a state of shock.'

Monaco striker Radamel Falcao also sent his best wishes to the player and his club, tweeting: 'I'm sorry for everything that has happened. We are all well. I wish a speedy recovery to Marc Bartra.'

Dortmund also released a statement explaining what happened.

'Shortly after the departure of the Borussia Dortmund team bus from the hotel to the stadium there was an incident,' Dortmund said in a statement.

'The bus has been damaged in two places. One person has been injured and is in the hospital. At this point we will inform as soon as we know more.'

In the immediate aftermath of the explosions, Dortmund said there was 'no cause for concern' for those at the stadium, and added the club were in close contact with the emergency services and UEFA.

Monaco released a statement, saying: 'Faced with this difficult situation, AS Monaco wishes to express its full support for the whole Borussia Dortmund team and club.'

He added that there was 'no alternative' to rescheduling the match for Wednesday, as Monaco also has to play at the weekend and the return Champions League match is scheduled for next week.

'It's a very unfortunate situation but there was no other way,' he said.

After the explosions, Dortmund players were transferred to the ground in minibuses and later made their way home on private cars.

Dortmund and German Football League (DFL) president Reinhard Rauball said it would be a 'bad thing' for the perpetrators to have any impact on the outcome of the quarter-final tie.

He said in a statement on the club's website: 'Of course this is an extremely difficult situation for the players.

'But they are professionals, and I am convinced that they will put this away and will produce a performance (on Wednesday).

'It would be a bad thing for those who did this to succeed because the team is influenced in some way.'

Wolves manager Paul Lambert, who lifted the Champions League with Borussia Dortmund in 1997, was inside Signal Iduna Park working as a pundit for BT Sport and said the right decision had been made.

'It looks like the game will be called off and quite right so. It's really uncertain what has happened but you've got to call it off,' he said.

Fellow summariser Glen Hoddle agreed, adding: 'It's dreadful [if a player is on their way to hospital]. The game has got to not go ahead there is no doubt about. UEFA has got to put out a statement in the next few minutes.

'Your mind immediately as a player will go to your friend, your team-mate and hoping that he's OK.

'You'll be shaken up by the incident yourself so to be expected to concentrate on the level of game which is the Champions League quarter-final tonight, it's unfair. It's unfair on the players and unfair on the club.'

Germany's interior minister Thomas de Maziere also spoke out after the incident.

He said: 'My thoughts are with the team. Now we have to find out what lay behind this. I hope that tomorrow football will once again take centre stage.'

Germany has seen matches postponed over security concerns before.

In Hannover, in November 2015, Germany's international soccer friendly against the Netherlands was canceled just before kickoff after police feared an explosive device might be detonated at the stadium.

It came days after devices were detonated outside the Stade de France in Paris as France was playing Germany as part of a coordinated attack on the French capital.
