Kendrick Lamar during the 2016 MTV Movie Awards at Warner Bros. Studios on April 9, 2016 in Burbank, Calif.

It's aboutÂ DAMN.Â time Kendrick Lamar's album dropped.

After putting the rap game in a chokehold with the freebie "The Heart Part 4" and the consequent show-stealer "Humble.," the Compton rapper has had fans thirsting for his fourth studio effortÂ DAMN.Â

The Top Dawg signee is in tip-top form on the 14-track set. He gets onÂ his conscious tip ("DNA.," "Yah.") and even unexpectedly gets his Romeo onÂ ("Love"). Other highlights:Â U2Â on the politically charged "XXX.," theÂ LeBronÂ James-approvedÂ "Element.,"Â RihannaÂ on the intoxicating "Loyalty." and the vulnerable "Fear."

That's not a slight to the other entries onÂ DAMN., though. This album is best enjoyed from front to back.
