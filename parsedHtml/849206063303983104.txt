Chechen police have rounded up more than 100 men suspected of being gay killing three according to reports in the Russian media.

President Razman Kadyrov, who is a key ally of Vladimir Putin, ordered the clampdown, although officially his regime is denying the arrests claiming 'it is impossible to persecute those who are not in the republic'.

The report was carried in Novoya Gazeta although the Chechen government claims there are no gay people in their country.

Kadyrov, who introduced Islamic rule in the Muslim-majority region, has been accused of earlier human rights violations.

He has described the allegations as 'absolute lies and disinformation'.

He also built what is described as Europe's biggest mosque.

Kadyrov's spokesman Alvi Karimov told the Interfax News Agency: 'You cannot arrest or repress people who just donâ€™t exist in the republic.

'If such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return.'

According to the New York Times, gay men on the region have been deleting their social media profiles after it was reported authorities tried to lure gay men into dates and arrested them.

The reports from Russia claim those arrested range from just 15 to 50.
