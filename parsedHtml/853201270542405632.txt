Who Are the Producers on Harry Styles' Album?

Harry Styles pulled back the curtain just a bit on his new album on Thursday (Apr. 13) with the news that the self-titled, 10-song solo debut will drop on May 12. And while the announcement still leaves plenty of questions -- why is Harry face-down and shirtless in a pool of pink water on the cover? Who helped him write the songs? -- one thing we do know is which producers helped the former One Direction star craft the tunes.

Styles has already served notice that he's willing to go a bit off the beaten path for his solo bow, starting with the Bowie-meets-Pink-Floyd, Coldplay-meets-Eric-Carmen sound of the first single, "Sign of the Times." But his choice of producers is also a signal that he's not content toÂ play by the rules. A look at Harry's collaborators:

Jeff Bhasker: Best known for his award-winningÂ work with alternative group fun. on their smash breakthrough Some Nights -- which netted himÂ the Grammy for Song of the Year for "We Are Young" -- BhaskerÂ is credited as the executive producer on Styles' album.

He took home yet more Grammy gold in 2016 as one of the producers on the Record of the Year winning Ronson smash "Uptown Funk."

Bhasker also released Born on the Fourth of July, a bold, experimental solo concept album under the name Billy Kraven, in 2013.

Tyler Johnson: Another frequentÂ Bhasker associate, Johnson was also part of the team behind the 2012Â Bhasker-producedÂ Pink hit "Just Give Me a Reason" (he engineered it), as well as providing sampling advice on fun.'s Some Nights, and producing and engineering songs for All American Rejects, OneRepublic, Ed SheeranÂ and MikkyÂ Ekko. He also lent songwriting expertise to songs by Miley Cyrus, SonReal andÂ John Legend on the singer's 2016 DarknessÂ and Light album.

Johnson has also dabbled in the country world, helping write Cam's breakthrough single "Burning House" and its follow-up, "Mayday" (in addition to playing guitar, keyboards and programming the drums), as well as co-writing and co-producing Keith Urban's "Gone Tomorrow (Here Today)," from the star's Ripcord album.
