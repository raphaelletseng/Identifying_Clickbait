How Trump’s Calls to World Leaders Are Upsetting Decades of Diplomacy
Dec. 2 Mr. Trump talks to the president of Taiwan, becoming the first U.S. president or president-elect to do so since 1979. Why it matters The call with President Tsai Ing-wen risks infuriating China , which wants to bring Taiwan back under mainland rule. By honoring the Taiwanese president with a formal call, Mr. Trump’s transition team implicitly suggests that it considers Taiwan an independent state. The U.S. has declined to recognize Taiwan since 1979, when it shifted recognition to the government in Beijing. Taiwan itself has yet to declare formal independence. Mr. Trump tweeted , “The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency.” Dec. 2 Mr. Trump endorses the Philippines’ violent antidrug campaign, says President Rodrigo Duterte. Why it matters Mr. Duterte has been accused of gross human rights abuses, referred to President Obama as a “son of a bitch” and declared his country’s “separation” from the U.S. during a recent trip to Beijing. Mr. Duterte said the president-elect was “quite sensitive” to “our worry about drugs” and that his country’s crackdown on drug users was being conducted “the right way.” There was no immediate response from Mr. Trump to Mr. Duterte’s description of the phone call or to a Reuters report that Mr. Trump invited the Philippines president to Washington. Nov. 30 Mr. Trump praises Kazakhstan’s leader for “fantastic success.” Why it matters Mr. Trump praised Nursultan A. Nazarbayev , the president of Kazakhstan since 1991, in tones that suggest approval for Mr. Nazarbayev’s strongman rule. According to the Kazakh government’s readout of the call , Mr. Trump “stressed that under the leadership of Nursultan Nazarbayev, our country over the years of independence had achieved fantastic success that can be called a ‘miracle.’” Nov. 30 Mr. Trump accepts an invitation to visit Pakistan, “a terrific country.” Why it matters Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif invited Mr. Trump to visit, according to a Pakistani government readout of their call. Should Mr. Trump follow through, he risks alienating India, which sees Pakistan as a major antagonist, and appearing to reward Pakistan’s behavior; should he renege, he risks upsetting Pakistani leaders who are sensitive about perceived American intransigence. Either way, the call could upset the delicate balance of India-Pakistan ties, which the U.S. has struggled to manage amid a history of wars and recent skirmishes. Nov. 17 Ivanka Trump joins a meeting with the Japanese prime minister. Why it matters Rather than inviting State Department officials to staff his meeting with Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, Mr. Trump invited his daughter Ivanka. The meeting alarmed diplomats, who worried that Mr. Trump lacked preparation after a long record of criticizing Japan. It also blurred the line between Mr. Trump’s businesses, which Ms. Trump helps run, and the U.S. government, with which she has no role. Nov. 10 After brushing off the United Kingdom, Mr. Trump offers a casual invitation to the British prime minister. Why it matters Mr. Trump spoke to nine other leaders before British Prime Minister Theresa May, an unusual break with the two countries’ long-standing special relationship. “If you travel to the US you should let me know,” he told her , far short of a formal invitation.Trump also met with Nigel Farage, former leader of the fringe U.K. Independence Party — a slap to Ms. May. He later said that Mr. Farage should become the British ambassador to the United States, though presidents typically avoid telling foreign counterparts how to staff their governments. An earlier version of this article misstated the date that Mr. Trump spoke with Nursultan Nazarbayev, the leader of Kazakhstan. It was on Nov. 30, not Dec. 2.
