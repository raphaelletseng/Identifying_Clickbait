Google and Uber alums have created a doctor's office that's like an Apple Store meets 'Westworld'


Somewhere between stepping into a full-body scanner that measures the elasticity of my veins and watching a cup used for urine samples disappear into the bathroom wall, I realized Forward is not your average doctor's office. It's like an Apple Store meets "Westworld."

Staring down a massive touch-screen monitor in the exam room, I tell Adrian Aoun, founder and CEO of Forward, that I feel like I'm inside HBO's sci-fi thriller.

"Yeah, but the good, not-creepy version, I hope," Aoun says.

Forward emerged from stealth mode on January 17 to announce the opening of its first doctor's office in San Francisco. The company offers a futuristic take on the popular concierge medical practice model, complete with state-of-the-art diagnostics tools, an artificial-intelligence system that listens and takes notes for physicians, and a pricey $149 monthly membership.

I recently toured Forward's flagship location before it opened to see what it was like.
