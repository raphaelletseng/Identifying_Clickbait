Victoria Beckham's Spice Girl Carpool Karaoke Is Here. Sort Of.
The time has FINALLY come. Victoria Beckham rode shotgun alongside “Late Late Show” host James Corden for a Spice Girls-filled Carpool Karaoke segment ― except there was one big change. The highly anticipated singalong was only a small part of a somewhat bizarre recreation of the trailer for the 1980s film, “Mannequin.” Earlier on Thursday, the former Spice Girl teased the upcoming appearance on Snapchat, saying she was filming something “top secret.” Of the two-and-a-half minute trailer, only about 30 seconds were dedicated to Carpool Karaoke. But at least the song Beckham and Corden chose to sing will spice up everyone’s day. Watch the clip in the video above.  ALSO ON HUFFPOST MORE:
