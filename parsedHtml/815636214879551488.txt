Mariah Carey Had A Rough Time With Her New Year's Eve Performance
Mariah Carey performed just before midnight at Times Square for and, well, things did not go smoothly. I'm getting ready perform right before the ball drop on @NYRE! Are you ready to celebrate? #RockinEve… https://t.co/cFizA7YcH6 Carey was out of sync with her backing track, at times not even mouthing the words, in apparent frustration. “We didn’t have a soundcheck for this New Year’s, baby,” she said after missing about half the lyrics of her hit “Emotion.” It was painful to watch. Even Milli Vanilli is embarrassed by Mariah Carey's debacle. It sparked a finger-pointing back-and-forth between Carey’s team and Dick Clark Productions. Carey rep Nicole Perna told that Dick Clark Productions “set her up to fail” and that there were issues with her in-ear monitors. “We told them [the stage managers] that the in-ears were not working 10 minutes before the performance,” Carey’s agent, Stella Bulochnikov, told . But on Tuesday Dick Clark Productions told it investigated and the allegation that it “would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.” The company added, “In very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television, however, an initial investigation has indicated that DCP had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey’s New Year’s Eve performance.” Twitter, of course, made jokes. Ohio State Football: Well that may have been the worst New Years Eve performance ever..
