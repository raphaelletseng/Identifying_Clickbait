Pizza dipped in milk is the most disrespectful pizza crime yet
Pizza dipped in milk is the most disrespectful pizza crime yet
As head of the Department of Pizza Crime (just go with it), I hereby denounce pizza dipped in milk as the most heinous pizza offense yet. The ghastly combo hit the internet earlier this week, when a 20-year-old college student posted a photo of it to Twitter . She's since made her account private, but people have reposted it anywayâ€”accompanied, of course, by their opinions.

Here are some reasons why this is the worst: Pizza is not cookies. Pizza, because it already has sauce, does not need to be wetter. Liquid-wise, it can be improved only by another savory sauce (buffalo, ranch, garlic sauce, etc.). Now you have to drink milk with bits of pizza in it â€” cheesy tomato milk. :/ And fellow pizza crimes don't really hold a candle.  you might ask. And that pizza made with peas and mayonnaise ? Well, one's a matter of taste, and the other's just disgusting, to be sureâ€”a pizza troll, if you will, if it can be called a pizza at all. But this? This is something else . I read somewhere that people are WILLINGLY dipping their pizza in milk and I will not sit here quietly while such atrocities are going on â€” ramÃ³n (@RGKMC_) March 4, 2017 good morning everyone except the person who dipped their pizza in milk â€” todd coward (@gothbaseball) March 4, 2017 If we're on a date and you dip your pizza in milk I'm getting up from the table and walking away. I don't need to be around that energy. â€” Elijah (@EEEEEElijah) March 3, 2017 Apparently pizza dipped in milk is a thing and I'd just like to announce this country needs to get its shit together... â€” Cougar Bait (@CougarOnAir) March 3, 2017 Pineapple on pizza is heaven. Don't fight me on this. But today I've seen pizza dipped in milk.. and topped with bananas. I'm done â€” Kachine Chingwa (@KachineChingwa) March 4, 2017 So, please: Don't dip your pizza in milk. Save yourself, because there's a worst case scenario here: trying milk pizza could ruin the taste of pizza for you forever. Just, like, have a nice soda with your pizza instead. And don't even think about dipping. Seriously.Â Don't. BONUS: This hair dye changes color based on your environment

Okay. Here are some reasons why this is the worst:

Pizza is not cookies.

Pizza, because it already has sauce, does not need to be wetter. Liquid-wise, it can be improved only by another savory sauce (buffalo, ranch, garlic sauce, etc.).

Now you have to drink milk with bits of pizza in it â€” cheesy tomato milk.

:/

And fellow pizza crimes don't really hold a candle. Well, what about pineapple pizza? you might ask. And that pizza made with peas and mayonnaise? Well, one's a matter of taste, and the other's just disgusting, to be sureâ€”a pizza troll, if you will, if it can be called a pizza at all.

But this? This is something else entirely.
