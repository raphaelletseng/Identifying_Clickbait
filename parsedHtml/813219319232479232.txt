As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, two rival factions of the Los Zetas Cartel have been fighting for control of lucrative drug trafficking routes in the border states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila. The faction calling themselves CDN has been at war with the factions Vieja Escuela Z and Grupo Bravo.

The fighting between the two rival factions have spread terror through this city as the number of kidnappings, executions and shootouts continue to climb every day.

Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
