Empowerment through education

Photographer: “There are many people here in Johannesburg, rich and poor, trying to make sure the kids in the townships get a better chance than their parents did. Like this preschool teacher at a Saturday workshop, learning how to be better at her job so as the children in her care will be bolder and brighter that they might’ve been.” Karin Andreasson: “Light falls beautifully on the teacher’s natural smile and the rich colours help to give this picture a warm and positive feel.”
