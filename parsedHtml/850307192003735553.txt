It was not clear whether Ms. Cristea was thrown into the Thames after being hit by the vehicle the assailant, Khalid Masood , was driving, or if she leapt into the water to escape. She was rescued from the water by a lifeboat crew before being hospitalized. During the attack, Mr. Masood, a British-born 52-year-old with a history of violence, rammed a rented Hyundai into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. He then crashed the vehicle into a fence, burst through a gate of the Palace of Westminster and fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer. He was shot and killed by the police.
