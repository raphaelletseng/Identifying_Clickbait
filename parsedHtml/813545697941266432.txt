Janelle Rice shared a touching video Sunday on Facebook of her 11-year-old biological son, Landon, opening the present he's always dreamed of: his adoption certificate.

"[Landon] really wanted to be adopted by [my husband] Daniel and have his last name changed," Rice told Mashable, "And we felt it was finally time!"

Over the course of Janelle and Daniel's 10 year marriage, Landon has been open about his desire to be adopted.

"At his fifth grade graduation in May, he was called up to the stage to get his 'diploma' and he told his teachers he wanted to go by Landon Rice (rather than his birth last name) â€” that's when we knew we had to begin," she said.
