Syrian pro-government forces posed for a selfie in the courtyard of the ancient Umayyad mosque in the old city of Aleppo. In November, Syrian government forces launched a renewed assault and rapidly retook almost all of the opposition-held east. By mid-December they had pushed the rebels into only a few neighbourhoods. On 15 December, the warring sides reached a ceasefire deal under which rebel fighters and their families could be moved to other rebel-held parts of the country and the injured taken to hospital.
