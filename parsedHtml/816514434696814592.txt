Kansas' Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk Goes Coast-to-Coast, Sinks Game-Winner vs. KSU
Talk about a walk-off. With 5.6 seconds to go and the score tied at 88 on Tuesday night against the Kansas State Wildcats, Kansas Jayhawks guard Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk came up clutch. The Ukrainian junior went nearly coast-to-coast and laid in a smooth game-winning layup. While Jayhawks fans celebrated, KSU seemed to have a serious gripe with the officials—it looked like Mykhailiuk took three steps. Or four. Of course Kansas gets three steps for he win and it not be a walk. Did anyone expects @KU refs to call this? Wow. @Big12Conference https://t.co/O3gmTwwpQi Kansas came out on top, though, extending its home winning streak to 50 games—the longest in the nation. [Twitter] Like the new article format?
