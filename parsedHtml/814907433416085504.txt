They have shamelessly flaunted their wealth all year and hear we reveal the most shocking moments The Rich Kids of Instagram have showcased this year

There has been no lack of super cars and holidays have been rife as the teens make the most of their parent's generous nature.

While many of us will be lucky to get a holiday this year it seems that for the Rich Kids of Britain the holiday never ends.

Members of the Instagram account have been sharing photographs of their outrageous holiday homes with their online followers.

While many of us would be lucky to receive a £10 sub from our parents this kid was happy to flaunt their seven figure pocket money fortune

The account, which has amassed over 83,000 followers, showcases the enviable lives of British richest teens as they parade their fortune.

And as the cold months set in it seems that many of the wealthy youngsters are jetting off to hotter destinations for some winter sun.

Many of the recent photographs posted to the account see elegant young women lounging by their very own private pools.

While plenty of nations have their own dedicated 'Rich Kids' account perhaps the most controversial is the Rich Kids of Tehran.

The account has gained worldwide attention by revealing what life is really like for some inside the notoriously strict Islamic Republic of Iran.

The page, which has over 114,000 followers, describes itself as 'Stuff they don't want you to see about Iran'.

Many would agree that the most shocking posts are those that poke fun at those less fortunate such as this with the user sneering at 'peasants' who can't afford a super car

The owners of the account insist that any pictures showing the young people drinking or in bikinis were taken outside of the Islamic country.

The owners of the account told MailOnline that their pictures provoke a range of reactions and added: 'They all are different - some are positive, some say they are shocked as they knew Iran and heard of Iran from the "Homeland" series and the "Argo" movie! This really made us laugh!'.

Perhaps one of the most shocking displays of wealth came from the Rich Kids of London, who last month, could be seen cutting up a black Amex card 'for fun'.

Perhaps one of the most shocking displays of wealth came from the Rich Kids of London, who last month, could be seen cutting up a black Amex card 'for fun'

The video shared on the account sees a youngster using a circular motorised saw to slice the American Express card - which is only available to customers who spend over $10,000 (£8,015) a month - in two.

Despite the exclusive nature of the card - which is invitation only - the teens obviously saw it as disposable as they had no problem destroying it.

The Instagram account, which has amassed more than 188,000 followers, showcases the lifestyles of spoiled youngsters parading their parents' fortunes.

Several wealthy teens are lucky enough to have their own private cinema in their homes

Sneering at 'peasants' appears to be a popular past time for those who appear on the accounts

As well as sharing photos of their own wealth, the youngsters can often be seen taking the opportunity to sneer at 'peasants'.

One photograph showcasing a flaming bottle of golden champagne has been given the caption, 'Molotov cocktail to throw on peasants'.

Another picture sees a young man flaunting an eye-wateringly expensive wrist watch, with his pricey car visible in the background.

In the caption he's written: 'Plebs see me rolling they hating'.

The Rich Kids of Britain have been escaping the colder months by jetting off to their holiday homes for some winter sun

In another outrageous picture a youngster complains about having to drive a Bentley after crashing 'the Aston'.

The Rich Kids of Tehran proves to be a controversial account with usersgoing against strict Iranian laws

And while the Rich Kids of London caused a stir with their spoiled attitude this behaviour isn't limited to the capital.

The Rich Kids of UK account dedicated to Britain's wealthiest teens sees the spoilt youngsters parading their fortunes as they sneer at those who shop at Primark.

The rich kids take pleasure in not only their own five star lives but in laughing at those less fortunate than themselves.

In a photograph of the popular discount clothing store Primark a member of the account wastes no time in poking fun of its customers.

You would think that these teens have very little to complain about - however, some have standards so high that a Porsche is disappointing

Captioning the photo they write: 'the peasants lining up to go in Primark'.

Despite their disposable income many of the youngsters show little respect for the possesions they shamelessly flaunt.

In one photo a teen has spread his spending money across his bed with £50 notes covering his cover. The photo is captioned: 'Pillow for tonight.'

While many will be lucky to received any spending funds from their parents these kids bank accounts are bursting at the seams.
