Odd Lots: What Sneakers Can Tell You About How Financial Markets Work
Odd Lots: What Sneakers Can Tell You About How Financial Markets Work
Every week, hosts Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway take you on a not-so-random walk through hot topics in markets, finance, and economics. One of our favorite subjects here at is market structure, including the difficulties of trading assets that might not come in the same shape or size. This week our guest is Josh Luber , who has built a market for a non-uniform asset that's non-financial to boot: sneakers. The market for collectible sneakers — such as Air Jordans — is said to be worth over $1 billion. Yet it's very hard to get transparent pricing, in part because the action happens across a variety of different sites and venues. Luber explains how his startup StockX wants to unify the industry, bring about transparency, and fundamentally change how this market works.
