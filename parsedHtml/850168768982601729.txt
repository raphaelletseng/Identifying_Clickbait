Nielsen Music's First-Quarter Numbers: Explosive Growth for Streaming, Not So Much for Vinyl
Nielsen Music's First-Quarter Numbers: Explosive Growth for Streaming, Not So Much for Vinyl  by   FACEBOOK   TWITTER   EMAIL ME   PRINT   COMMENTS  On-demand streaming continued to enjoy explosive growth in the U.S. during theÂ first quarter of 2017, offsetting declines in physical and digital sales.Â According to Nielsen Music (formerly SoundScan), on-demand streaming climbed 35.2 percent in Q1 to 133.9 billion streams, up from 99.1 billion in the corresponding first three months of 2016. That breaks out to 86.1 billion audio on-demand streams, versus 51.65 billion in the same period last year. As forÂ video-on-demand, streams during the quarter wereÂ up only slightly to 47.8 billion, versus 47.4 billion inÂ 2016.Â (However, that is not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison because at some point during Q2 of last year, YouTube stopped reporting streams of tracks that don't attract 1,000 views a day.) This explosive growth in streaming comes after 2016's overall increase of 39.2 percent to 432 billion on-demand streams from 2015's 310 billion, as recorded by Nielsen Music. Programmed streaming also enjoyed robust growth, growing to 3.1 billion streams in the first quarter of 2017, versus 2.08 billion, a 49.2 percent increase in the same time frame in 2016. However, those numbers do not include Pandora, which doesn't report to Nielsen.  The top on-demand streamed song so far this year is Migos ' "Bad and Boujee," featuring Lil Uzi Vert , with 464.7 billion views for audio and video. Meanwhile, the overall No. 1 album so far this year is Ed Sheeran 's with 1.1 million equivalent album units to date. Moving over to sales, Sheeran's "Shape Of You" is the No. 1 selling song with 1.58 million downloads, while his album holds top seller status with with 503,000 scans. Meanwhile, the sales model continues to be under attack in the U.S., with physical album sales falling 21.2Â percent to 22.66 million units from 28.77 million in the first quarter of 2016; digital albums were down 18.9 percent to 17.7 million units from 21.8 million units; and digital tracks were down 23.8 percent to 158.4 million units from 207.9 million. Looking at the data by configuration, overall albums totaled 40.3 million in the first quarter, down from 50.7 million in the same period in 2016, and that represents a decline of 20.2 percent. Overall, on a consumption basis of albums plus track equivalent ones (TEA) and on-demand equivalent ones (SEA), the U.S. industry enjoyed 5.9 percent overall growth to 145.5 million units, up from 137.4 albums plus SEA and TEA units in the first quarter of 2016.  Looking at sales by format, the CD fell 23.4 percent to 19.6 million units from 25.5 million copies in 2016's Q1. Meanwhile, vinyl, which has averaged 38 percent annual growth from 2012 through 2015, slowed to 10 percent growth last year and so far in the first quarter is down 100,000 units, or 3.2 percent, to 3.01 million units in the first quarter of 2017. Consequently, some wonder if the format has peaked -- or is the downturn merely due to the release schedule cycles? Nevertheless, the top sellers seem quite resilient in the vinyl format, as the soundtrack has already scanned 25,000 units, and 266,000 overall since its release in December.
