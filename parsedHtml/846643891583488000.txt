Women Flood Twitter With Stories Of The First Time Their Clothes Were Sexualized
Women Flood Twitter With Stories Of The First Time Their Clothes Were Sexualized
Women on Twitter are speaking out after three young girls were turned away from a United Airlines flight on Sunday because their leggings were a violation of the airlines’ pass traveler’s dress code. One of the girls was able to board after putting a dress over her outfit, and two were barred from boarding altogether. United released a statement on Sunday, saying that pass travelers ― travelers who are dependents or relatives of a United employee ― must adhere to the dress code. “When taking advantage of this benefit, all employees and pass riders are considered representatives of United,” it said. “And like most companies, we have a dress code that we ask employees and pass riders to follow.” Many on Twitter, including celebrities like Chrissy Teigen and Patricia Arquette , were quick to point out how ridiculous it was to police girls’ clothing. And in response to the news, writer Dana Schwartz asked women Sunday to share the first time they were “made to feel embarrassed and sexualized” for their outfits, and shared her experience as well. Ladies, when was the first time you were made to feel embarrassed and sexualized for what you wore? I was in 5th grade, shorts too short. It was the 2nd to last day of school. HOT out. I was a beanpole, everything was short on me. They made me call my mom to bring pants. Responses to Schwartz’s tweets poured in, and prompted the hashtag #StopShamingGirls . The responses were a sad reminder that women are not only sexualized way too early, but also punished and humiliated, at a ridiculously young age, for something as innocent as getting dressed. Check out some of the tweets below: 3rd grade-my SKORT ( #tbt ) was too short. Pointed out it was the same length as the other girls' but was told my long legs made a difference. https://t.co/VdlpGVmY4g @DanaSchwartzzz First day of high school sent home for wearing dress with thin straps that revealed I had no bra straps. Didn't need a bra! In my HS girls had to wear oversized t-shirts that said "I violated the dress code" if tank tops/leggings/etc. were deemed "inappropriate" https://t.co/DC7KB4pnQ4 1st grade. My look was sparkly leggings and a tshirt. Teacher made me put on an adult's polo from the nurses office to cover my butt. https://t.co/hcrSq9uGRK I was in 4th grade and was told that my tank top was inappropriate. School made me wear a sweatshirt in May and I got heatstroke. https://t.co/4B0iywP8RC First time I remember clearly: vice-principal (ninth grade?) stopped me in hallway to say the straps on my shirt were too thin. https://t.co/JXFC6cxRBI @DanaSchwartzzz 6th grade. My skirt was too short. My teacher called me frog legs and sent me home. A high school principal would stand in the hallway + stop girls wearing shorts + skirts as they walked by. I always wore jeans to avoid him. https://t.co/05A1C0brvq @DanaSchwartzzz Wore a spaghetti strap dress to church in June without a shawl, religion teacher told me (7 y.o.) I was being intentionally disrespectful. @DanaSchwartzzz Age 7. Not allowed to wear bike shorts b/c they're too tight. Told not to wear red nail polish because "streetwalkers" do. @DanaSchwartzzz 5th grade. Was given a razor by my grandmother at a large family birthday party and told I needed to start shaving my legs. @DanaSchwartzzz 4th or 5th grade. Gray leggings were inappropriate. Nothing else was clean, but I didn't tell them that @DanaSchwartzzz 4th grade: spaghetti straps on tank tops were too revealing 4th grade, a teacher told me i should wear leggings with my dress because it was "overly revealing for plump people to wear dresses" https://t.co/lEA5EYiHxC ALSO ON HUFFPOST MORE:
